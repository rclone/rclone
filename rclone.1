.SS Installation with Ansible
.PP
This can be done with Stefan Weichinger\[aq]s ansible
role (https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone).
.PP
Instructions
.IP "1." 3
\f[C]git\ clone\ https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible\-rclone.git\f[]
into your local roles\-directory
.IP "2." 3
add the role to the hosts you want rclone installed to:
.IP

.SS Configure
.PP
First, you\[aq]ll need to configure rclone.
As the object storage systems have quite complicated authentication
these are kept in a config file.
(See the \f[C]\-\-config\f[] entry for how to find the config file and
choose its location.)
.PP
The easiest way to make the config is to run rclone with the config
option:
.IP
.nf

.SS Usage
.PP
Rclone syncs a directory tree from one storage system to another.
.PP
Its syntax is like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Syntax:\ [options]\ subcommand\ <parameters>\ <parameters...>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Source and destination paths are specified by the name you gave the
storage system in the config file then the sub path, eg "drive:myfolder"
to look at "myfolder" in Google drive.
.PP
You can define as many storage paths as you like in the config file.
.SS Subcommands
.PP
rclone uses a system of subcommands.
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ ls\ remote:path\ #\ lists\ a\ re
rclone\ copy\ /local/path\ remote:path\ #\ copies\ /local/path\ to\ the\ remote
rclone\ sync\ /local/path\ remote:path\ #\ syncs\ /local/path\ to\ the\ remote
\f[]
.fi
.SS rclone config
.PP
Enter an interactive configuration session.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
\f[C]rclone\ config\f[] enters an interactive configuration sessions
where you can setup new remotes and manage existing ones.
You may also set or remove a password to protect your configuration.
.PP
Additional functions:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]rclone\ config\ edit\f[] \[en] same as above

.SS rclone copy
.PP
Copy files from source to dest, skipping already copied
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Copy the source to the destination.
Doesn\[aq]t transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification
time or MD5SUM.
Doesn\[aq]t delete files from the destination.
.PP
Note that it is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not
the directory so when source:path is a directory, it\[aq]s the contents
of source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.
.PP
If dest:path doesn\[aq]t exist, it is created and the source:path
contents go there.
.PP
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ source:sourcepath\ dest:destpath
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Let\[aq]s say there are two files in sourcepath
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sourcepath/one.txt
sourcepath/two.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This copies them to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
destpath/one.txt
destpath/two.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Not to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
destpath/sourcepath/one.txt
destpath/sourcepath/two.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you are familiar with \f[C]rsync\f[], rclone always works as if you
had written a trailing / \- meaning "copy the contents of this
directory".
This applies to all commands and whether you are talking about the
source or destination.
.PP
See the \f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[] option for controlling whether rclone
lists the destination directory or not.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ source:path\ dest:path\ [flags]

.SS rclone sync
.PP
Make source and dest identical, modifying destination only.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only.
Doesn\[aq]t transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification
time or MD5SUM.
Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files if
necessary.
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[]: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
\f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] flag to see exactly what would be copied and
deleted.
.PP
Note that files in the destination won\[aq]t be deleted if there were
any errors at any point.
.PP
It is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not the
directory so when source:path is a directory, it\[aq]s the contents of
source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.
See extended explanation in the \f[C]copy\f[] command above if unsure.
.PP
If dest:path doesn\[aq]t exist, it is created and the source:path
contents go there.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ source:path\ dest:path\ [flags]

.SS rclone move
.PP
Move files from source to dest.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination directory.
Rclone will error if the source and destination overlap and the remote
does not support a server side directory move operation.
.PP
If no filters are in use and if possible this will server side move
\f[C]source:path\f[] into \f[C]dest:path\f[].
After this \f[C]source:path\f[] will no longer longer exist.
.PP
Otherwise for each file in \f[C]source:path\f[] selected by the filters
(if any) this will move it into \f[C]dest:path\f[].
If possible a server side move will be used, otherwise it will copy it
(server side if possible) into \f[C]dest:path\f[] then delete the
original (if no errors on copy) in \f[C]source:path\f[].
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[]: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
\-\-dry\-run flag.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ move\ source:path\ dest:path\ [flags]

.SS rclone delete
.PP
Remove the contents of path.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Remove the contents of path.
Unlike \f[C]purge\f[] it obeys include/exclude filters so can be used to
selectively delete files.
.PP
Eg delete all files bigger than 100MBytes
.PP
Check what would be deleted first (use either)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ \-\-min\-size\ 100M\ lsl\ remote:path
rclone\ \-\-dry\-run\ \-\-min\-size\ 100M\ delete\ remote:path
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then delete
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ \-\-min\-size\ 100M\ delete\ remote:path
\f[]
.fi
.PP
That reads "delete everything with a minimum size of 100 MB", hence
delete all files bigger than 100MBytes.

.SS rclone check
.PP
Checks the files in the source and destination match.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Checks the files in the source and destination match.
It compares sizes and hashes (MD5 or SHA1) and logs a report of files
which don\[aq]t match.
It doesn\[aq]t alter the source or destination.
.PP
If you supply the \-\-size\-only flag, it will only compare the sizes
not the hashes as well.
Use this for a quick check.
.PP
If you supply the \-\-download flag, it will download the data from both
remotes and check them against each other on the fly.
This can be useful for remotes that don\[aq]t support hashes or if you
really want to check all the data.

.SS rclone dedupe
.PP
Interactively find duplicate files delete/rename them.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
By default \f[C]dedupe\f[] interactively finds duplicate files and
offers to delete all but one or rename them to be different.
Only useful with Google Drive which can have duplicate file names.
.PP
In the first pass it will merge directories with the same name.
It will do this iteratively until all the identical directories have
been merged.
.PP
The \f[C]dedupe\f[] command will delete all but one of any identical
(same md5sum) files it finds without confirmation.
This means that for most duplicated files the \f[C]dedupe\f[] command
will not be interactive.
You can use \f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] to see what would happen without doing
anything.

Here is an example run.

Cryptcheck checks the integrity of a crypted remote.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone cryptcheck checks a remote against a crypted remote.
This is the equivalent of running rclone check, but able to check the
checksums of the crypted remote.
.PP
For it to work the underlying remote of the cryptedremote must support
some kind of checksum.
.PP
It works by reading the nonce from each file on the cryptedremote: and
using that to encrypt each file on the remote:.
It then checks the checksum of the underlying file on the cryptedremote:
against the checksum of the file it has just encrypted.
.PP
Use it like this

.SS rclone mount
.PP
Mount the remote as a mountpoint.
\f[B]EXPERIMENTAL\f[]
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone mount allows Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows to mount any of
Rclone\[aq]s cloud storage systems as a file system with FUSE.
.PP
This is \f[B]EXPERIMENTAL\f[] \- use with care.
.PP
First set up your remote using \f[C]rclone\ config\f[].
Check it works with \f[C]rclone\ ls\f[] etc.
.PP
Start the mount like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

manually with

.SS Installing on Windows
.PP
To run rclone mount on Windows, you will need to download and install
WinFsp (http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/).
.PP
WinFsp is an open source (https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp) Windows
File System Proxy which makes it easy to write user space file systems
for Windows.
It provides a FUSE emulation layer which rclone uses combination with
cgofuse (https://github.com/billziss-gh/cgofuse).
Both of these packages are by Bill Zissimopoulos who was very helpful
during the implementation of rclone mount for Windows.
.SS Windows caveats
.PP
Note that drives created as Administrator are not visible by other
accounts (including the account that was elevated as Administrator).
So if you start a Windows drive from an Administrative Command Prompt
and then try to access the same drive from Explorer (which does not run
as Administrator), you will not be able to see the new drive.
.PP
The easiest way around this is to start the drive from a normal command
prompt.
It is also possible to start a drive from the SYSTEM account (using the
WinFsp.Launcher
infrastructure (https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp/wiki/WinFsp-Service-Architecture))
which creates drives accessible for everyone on the system.
.SS Limitations
.PP
This can only write files seqentially, it can only seek when reading.
This means that many applications won\[aq]t work with their files on an
rclone mount.
.PP
The bucket based remotes (eg Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2,
Hubic) won\[aq]t work from the root \- you will need to specify a
bucket, or a path within the bucket.
So \f[C]swift:\f[] won\[aq]t work whereas \f[C]swift:bucket\f[] will as
will \f[C]swift:bucket/path\f[].
None of these support the concept of directories, so empty directories
will have a tendency to disappear once they fall out of the directory
cache.
.PP
Only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OS X and Windows at the moment.
.SS rclone mount vs rclone sync/copy
.PP
File systems expect things to be 100% reliable, whereas cloud storage
systems are a long way from 100% reliable.
The rclone sync/copy commands cope with this with lots of retries.
However rclone mount can\[aq]t use retries in the same way without
making local copies of the uploads.
This might happen in the future, but for the moment rclone mount
won\[aq]t do that, so will be less reliable than the rclone command.
.SS Filters
.PP
Note that all the rclone filters can be used to select a subset of the
files to be visible in the mount.
.SS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]\-\-dir\-cache\-time\f[] flag, you can set how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate
the cache.
However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once the
cache expires.
.PP
Alternatively, you can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[] signal to rclone for it to
flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:

.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone rcat reads from standard input (stdin) and copies it to a single
remote file.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
echo\ "hello\ world"\ |\ rclone\ rcat\ remote:path/to/file
ffmpeg\ \-\ |\ rclone\ rcat\ \-\-checksum\ remote:path/to/file
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If the remote file already exists, it will be overwritten.
.PP
rcat will try to upload small files in a single request, which is
usually more efficient than the streaming/chunked upload endpoints,
which use multiple requests.
Exact behaviour depends on the remote.
What is considered a small file may be set through
\f[C]\-\-streaming\-upload\-cutoff\f[].
Uploading only starts after the cutoff is reached or if the file ends
before that.
The data must fit into RAM.
The cutoff needs to be small enough to adhere the limits of your remote,
please see there.
Generally speaking, setting this cutoff too high will decrease your
performance.
.PP
Note that the upload can also not be retried because the data is not
kept around until the upload succeeds.
If you need to transfer a lot of data, you\[aq]re better off caching
locally and then \f[C]rclone\ move\f[] it to the destination.

.SS rclone rmdirs
.PP
Remove empty directories under the path.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
This removes any empty directories (or directories that only contain
empty directories) under the path that it finds, including the path if
it has nothing in.
.PP
This is useful for tidying up remotes that rclone has left a lot of
empty directories in.

.SS rclone tree
.PP
List the contents of the remote in a tree like fashion.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone tree lists the contents of a remote in a similar way to the unix
tree command.
.PP
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ tree\ remote:path
/
├──\ file1
├──\ file2
├──\ file3
└──\ subdir
\ \ \ \ ├──\ file4
\ \ \ \ └──\ file5

1\ directories,\ 5\ files
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You can use any of the filtering options with the tree command (eg
\-\-include and \-\-exclude).
You can also use \-\-fast\-list.
.PP
The tree command has many options for controlling the listing which are
compatible with the tree command.
Note that not all of them have short options as they conflict with
rclone\[aq]s short options.

.SS Copying single files
.PP
rclone normally syncs or copies directories.
However, if the source remote points to a file, rclone will just copy
that file.
The destination remote must point to a directory \- rclone will give the
error
\f[C]Failed\ to\ create\ file\ system\ for\ "remote:file":\ is\ a\ file\ not\ a\ directory\f[]
if it isn\[aq]t.
.PP
For example, suppose you have a remote with a file in called
\f[C]test.jpg\f[], then you could copy just that file like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ remote:test.jpg\ /tmp/download
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The file \f[C]test.jpg\f[] will be placed inside \f[C]/tmp/download\f[].
.PP
This is equivalent to specifying
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ \-\-no\-traverse\ \-\-files\-from\ /tmp/files\ remote:\ /tmp/download
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Where \f[C]/tmp/files\f[] contains the single line
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
test.jpg
\f[]
.fi
.PP
It is recommended to use \f[C]copy\f[] when copying individual files,
not \f[C]sync\f[].
They have pretty much the same effect but \f[C]copy\f[] will use a lot
less memory.
.SS Quoting and the shell
.PP
When you are typing commands to your computer you are using something
called the command line shell.
This interprets various characters in an OS specific way.
.PP
Here are some gotchas which may help users unfamiliar with the shell
rules
.SS Linux / OSX
.PP
If your names have spaces or shell metacharacters (eg \f[C]*\f[],
\f[C]?\f[], \f[C]$\f[], \f[C]\[aq]\f[], \f[C]"\f[] etc) then you must
quote them.
Use single quotes \f[C]\[aq]\f[] by default.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ \[aq]Important\ files?\[aq]\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you want to send a \f[C]\[aq]\f[] you will need to use \f[C]"\f[], eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ "O\[aq]Reilly\ Reviews"\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The rules for quoting metacharacters are complicated and if you want the
full details you\[aq]ll have to consult the manual page for your shell.
.SS Windows
.PP
If your names have spaces in you need to put them in \f[C]"\f[], eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ "E:\\folder\ name\\folder\ name\\folder\ name"\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you are using the root directory on its own then don\[aq]t quote it
(see #464 (https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/464) for why), eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ E:\\\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.SS Copying files or directories with \f[C]:\f[] in the names
.PP
rclone uses \f[C]:\f[] to mark a remote name.
This is, however, a valid filename component in non\-Windows OSes.
The remote name parser will only search for a \f[C]:\f[] up to the first
\f[C]/\f[] so if you need to act on a file or directory like this then
use the full path starting with a \f[C]/\f[], or use \f[C]\&./\f[] as a
current directory prefix.
.PP
So to sync a directory called \f[C]sync:me\f[] to a remote called
\f[C]remote:\f[] use
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ ./sync:me\ remote:path
\f[]
.fi
.PP
or
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ /full/path/to/sync:me\ remote:path
\f[]
.fi
.SS Server Side Copy
.PP
Most remotes (but not all \- see the
overview (/overview/#optional-features)) support server side copy.
.PP
This means if you want to copy one folder to another then rclone
won\[aq]t download all the files and re\-upload them; it will instruct
the server to copy them in place.
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ s3:oldbucket\ s3:newbucket
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Will copy the contents of \f[C]oldbucket\f[] to \f[C]newbucket\f[]
without downloading and re\-uploading.
.PP
Remotes which don\[aq]t support server side copy \f[B]will\f[] download
and re\-upload in this case.
.PP
Server side copies are used with \f[C]sync\f[] and \f[C]copy\f[] and
will be identified in the log when using the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag.
The \f[C]move\f[] command may also use them if remote doesn\[aq]t
support server side move directly.
This is done by issuing a server side copy then a delete which is much
quicker than a download and re\-upload.
.PP
Server side copies will only be attempted if the remote names are the
same.
.PP
This can be used when scripting to make aged backups efficiently, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ remote:current\-backup\ remote:previous\-backup
rclone\ sync\ /path/to/files\ remote:current\-backup
\f[]
.fi
.SS Options
.PP
Rclone has a number of options to control its behaviour.
.PP
Options which use TIME use the go time parser.
A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each
with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "\-1.5h" or
"2h45m".
Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
.PP
Options which use SIZE use kByte by default.
However, a suffix of \f[C]b\f[] for bytes, \f[C]k\f[] for kBytes,
\f[C]M\f[] for MBytes and \f[C]G\f[] for GBytes may be used.
These are the binary units, eg 1, 2**10, 2**20, 2**30 respectively.
.SS \-\-backup\-dir=DIR
.PP
When using \f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[] or \f[C]move\f[] any files which
would have been overwritten or deleted are moved in their original
hierarchy into this directory.
.PP
If \f[C]\-\-suffix\f[] is set, then the moved files will have the suffix
added to them.
If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has been added)
in DIR, then it will be overwritten.
.PP
The remote in use must support server side move or copy and you must use
the same remote as the destination of the sync.
The backup directory must not overlap the destination directory.
.PP
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ /path/to/local\ remote:current\ \-\-backup\-dir\ remote:old
\f[]
.fi
.PP
will sync \f[C]/path/to/local\f[] to \f[C]remote:current\f[], but for
any files which would have been updated or deleted will be stored in
\f[C]remote:old\f[].
.PP
If running rclone from a script you might want to use today\[aq]s date
as the directory name passed to \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir\f[] to store the
old files, or you might want to pass \f[C]\-\-suffix\f[] with
today\[aq]s date.
.SS \-\-bind string
.PP
Local address to bind to for outgoing connections.
This can be an IPv4 address (1.2.3.4), an IPv6 address (1234::789A) or
host name.
If the host name doesn\[aq]t resolve or resoves to more than one IP
address it will give an error.
.SS \-\-bwlimit=BANDWIDTH_SPEC
.PP
This option controls the bandwidth limit.
Limits can be specified in two ways: As a single limit, or as a
timetable.
.PP
Single limits last for the duration of the session.
To use a single limit, specify the desired bandwidth in kBytes/s, or use
a suffix b|k|M|G.
The default is \f[C]0\f[] which means to not limit bandwidth.
.PP
For example, to limit bandwidth usage to 10 MBytes/s use
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit\ 10M\f[]
.PP
It is also possible to specify a "timetable" of limits, which will cause
certain limits to be applied at certain times.
To specify a timetable, format your entries as "HH:MM,BANDWIDTH
HH:MM,BANDWIDTH...".
.PP
An example of a typical timetable to avoid link saturation during
daytime working hours could be:
.PP
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit\ "08:00,512\ 12:00,10M\ 13:00,512\ 18:00,30M\ 23:00,off"\f[]
.PP
In this example, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512kBytes/sec at
8am.
At noon, it will raise to 10Mbytes/s, and drop back to 512kBytes/sec at
1pm.
At 6pm, the bandwidth limit will be set to 30MBytes/s, and at 11pm it
will be completely disabled (full speed).
Anything between 11pm and 8am will remain unlimited.
.PP
Bandwidth limits only apply to the data transfer.
They don\[aq]t apply to the bandwidth of the directory listings etc.
.PP
Note that the units are Bytes/s, not Bits/s.
Typically connections are measured in Bits/s \- to convert divide by 8.
For example, let\[aq]s say you have a 10 Mbit/s connection and you wish
rclone to use half of it \- 5 Mbit/s.
This is 5/8 = 0.625MByte/s so you would use a
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit\ 0.625M\f[] parameter for rclone.
.PP
On Unix systems (Linux, MacOS, \&...) the bandwidth limiter can be
toggled by sending a \f[C]SIGUSR2\f[] signal to rclone.
This allows to remove the limitations of a long running rclone transfer
and to restore it back to the value specified with \f[C]\-\-bwlimit\f[]
quickly when needed.
Assuming there is only one rclone instance running, you can toggle the
limiter like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill\ \-SIGUSR2\ $(pidof\ rclone)
\f[]
.fi
.SS \-\-buffer\-size=SIZE
.PP
Use this sized buffer to speed up file transfers.
Each \f[C]\-\-transfer\f[] will use this much memory for buffering.
.PP
Set to 0 to disable the buffering for the minimum memory usage.
.SS \-\-checkers=N
.PP
The number of checkers to run in parallel.
Checkers do the equality checking of files during a sync.
For some storage systems (eg S3, Swift, Dropbox) this can take a
significant amount of time so they are run in parallel.
.PP
The default is to run 8 checkers in parallel.
.SS \-c, \-\-checksum
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check the file hash and size to
determine if files are equal.
.PP
This is useful when the remote doesn\[aq]t support setting modified time
and a more accurate sync is desired than just checking the file size.
.PP
This is very useful when transferring between remotes which store the
same hash type on the object, eg Drive and Swift.
For details of which remotes support which hash type see the table in
the overview section (https://rclone.org/overview/).
.PP
Eg \f[C]rclone\ \-\-checksum\ sync\ s3:/bucket\ swift:/bucket\f[] would
run much quicker than without the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.PP
When using this flag, rclone won\[aq]t update mtimes of remote files if
they are incorrect as it would normally.
.SS \-\-config=CONFIG_FILE
.PP
Specify the location of the rclone config file.
.PP
Normally the config file is in your home directory as a file called
\f[C]\&.config/rclone/rclone.conf\f[] (or \f[C]\&.rclone.conf\f[] if
created with an older version).
If \f[C]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\f[] is set it will be at
\f[C]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rclone/rclone.conf\f[]
.PP
If you run \f[C]rclone\ \-h\f[] and look at the help for the
\f[C]\-\-config\f[] option you will see where the default location is
for you.
.PP
Use this flag to override the config location, eg
\f[C]rclone\ \-\-config=".myconfig"\ .config\f[].
.SS \-\-contimeout=TIME
.PP
Set the connection timeout.
This should be in go time format which looks like \f[C]5s\f[] for 5
seconds, \f[C]10m\f[] for 10 minutes, or \f[C]3h30m\f[].
.PP
The connection timeout is the amount of time rclone will wait for a
connection to go through to a remote object storage system.
It is \f[C]1m\f[] by default.
.SS \-\-dedupe\-mode MODE
.PP
Mode to run dedupe command in.
One of \f[C]interactive\f[], \f[C]skip\f[], \f[C]first\f[],
\f[C]newest\f[], \f[C]oldest\f[], \f[C]rename\f[].
The default is \f[C]interactive\f[].
See the dedupe command for more information as to what these options
mean.
.SS \-\-disable FEATURE,FEATURE,...
.PP
This disables a comma separated list of optional features.
For example to disable server side move and server side copy use:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-disable\ move,copy
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The features can be put in in any case.
.PP
To see a list of which features can be disabled use:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-disable\ help
\f[]
.fi
.PP
See the overview features (/overview/#features) and optional
features (/overview/#optional-features) to get an idea of which feature
does what.
.PP
This flag can be useful for debugging and in exceptional circumstances
(eg Google Drive limiting the total volume of Server Side Copies to
100GB/day).
.SS \-n, \-\-dry\-run
.PP
Do a trial run with no permanent changes.
Use this to see what rclone would do without actually doing it.
Useful when setting up the \f[C]sync\f[] command which deletes files in
the destination.
.SS \-\-ignore\-checksum
.PP
Normally rclone will check that the checksums of transferred files
match, and give an error "corrupted on transfer" if they don\[aq]t.
.PP
You can use this option to skip that check.
You should only use it if you have had the "corrupted on transfer" error
message and you are sure you might want to transfer potentially
corrupted data.
.SS \-\-ignore\-existing
.PP
Using this option will make rclone unconditionally skip all files that
exist on the destination, no matter the content of these files.
.PP
While this isn\[aq]t a generally recommended option, it can be useful in
cases where your files change due to encryption.
However, it cannot correct partial transfers in case a transfer was
interrupted.
.SS \-\-ignore\-size
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check only the modification time.
If \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] is set then it only checks the checksum.
.PP
It will also cause rclone to skip verifying the sizes are the same after
transfer.
.PP
This can be useful for transferring files to and from OneDrive which
occasionally misreports the size of image files (see
#399 (https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/399) for more info).
.SS \-I, \-\-ignore\-times
.PP
Using this option will cause rclone to unconditionally upload all files
regardless of the state of files on the destination.
.PP
Normally rclone would skip any files that have the same modification
time and are the same size (or have the same checksum if using
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[]).
.SS \-\-immutable
.PP
Treat source and destination files as immutable and disallow
modification.
.PP
With this option set, files will be created and deleted as requested,
but existing files will never be updated.
If an existing file does not match between the source and destination,
rclone will give the error
\f[C]Source\ and\ destination\ exist\ but\ do\ not\ match:\ immutable\ file\ modified\f[].
.PP
Note that only commands which transfer files (e.g.
\f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[], \f[C]move\f[]) are affected by this
behavior, and only modification is disallowed.
Files may still be deleted explicitly (e.g.
\f[C]delete\f[], \f[C]purge\f[]) or implicitly (e.g.
\f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]move\f[]).
Use \f[C]copy\ \-\-immutable\f[] if it is desired to avoid deletion as
well as modification.
.PP
This can be useful as an additional layer of protection for immutable or
append\-only data sets (notably backup archives), where modification
implies corruption and should not be propagated.
.SS \-\-log\-file=FILE
.PP
Log all of rclone\[aq]s output to FILE.
This is not active by default.
This can be useful for tracking down problems with syncs in combination
with the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag.
See the Logging section (#logging) for more info.
.SS \-\-log\-level LEVEL
.PP
This sets the log level for rclone.
The default log level is \f[C]INFO\f[].
.PP
\f[C]DEBUG\f[] is equivalent to \f[C]\-vv\f[].
It outputs lots of debug info \- useful for bug reports and really
finding out what rclone is doing.
.PP
\f[C]INFO\f[] is equivalent to \f[C]\-v\f[].
It outputs information about each transfer and prints stats once a
minute by default.
.PP
\f[C]NOTICE\f[] is the default log level if no logging flags are
supplied.
It outputs very little when things are working normally.
It outputs warnings and significant events.
.PP
\f[C]ERROR\f[] is equivalent to \f[C]\-q\f[].
It only outputs error messages.
.SS \-\-low\-level\-retries NUMBER
.PP
This controls the number of low level retries rclone does.
.PP
A low level retry is used to retry a failing operation \- typically one
HTTP request.
This might be uploading a chunk of a big file for example.
You will see low level retries in the log with the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag.
.PP
This shouldn\[aq]t need to be changed from the default in normal
operations.
However, if you get a lot of low level retries you may wish to reduce
the value so rclone moves on to a high level retry (see the
\f[C]\-\-retries\f[] flag) quicker.
.PP
Disable low level retries with \f[C]\-\-low\-level\-retries\ 1\f[].
.SS \-\-max\-depth=N
.PP
This modifies the recursion depth for all the commands except purge.
.PP
So if you do \f[C]rclone\ \-\-max\-depth\ 1\ ls\ remote:path\f[] you
will see only the files in the top level directory.
Using \f[C]\-\-max\-depth\ 2\f[] means you will see all the files in
first two directory levels and so on.
.PP
For historical reasons the \f[C]lsd\f[] command defaults to using a
\f[C]\-\-max\-depth\f[] of 1 \- you can override this with the command
line flag.
.PP
You can use this command to disable recursion (with
\f[C]\-\-max\-depth\ 1\f[]).
.PP
Note that if you use this with \f[C]sync\f[] and
\f[C]\-\-delete\-excluded\f[] the files not recursed through are
considered excluded and will be deleted on the destination.
Test first with \f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] if you are not sure what will
happen.
.SS \-\-modify\-window=TIME
.PP
When checking whether a file has been modified, this is the maximum
allowed time difference that a file can have and still be considered
equivalent.
.PP
The default is \f[C]1ns\f[] unless this is overridden by a remote.
For example OS X only stores modification times to the nearest second so
if you are reading and writing to an OS X filing system this will be
\f[C]1s\f[] by default.
.PP
This command line flag allows you to override that computed default.
.SS \-\-no\-gzip\-encoding
.PP
Don\[aq]t set \f[C]Accept\-Encoding:\ gzip\f[].
This means that rclone won\[aq]t ask the server for compressed files
automatically.
Useful if you\[aq]ve set the server to return files with
\f[C]Content\-Encoding:\ gzip\f[] but you uploaded compressed files.
.PP
There is no need to set this in normal operation, and doing so will
decrease the network transfer efficiency of rclone.
.SS \-\-no\-update\-modtime
.PP
When using this flag, rclone won\[aq]t update modification times of
remote files if they are incorrect as it would normally.
.PP
This can be used if the remote is being synced with another tool also
(eg the Google Drive client).
.SS \-q, \-\-quiet
.PP
Normally rclone outputs stats and a completion message.
If you set this flag it will make as little output as possible.
.SS \-\-retries int
.PP
Retry the entire sync if it fails this many times it fails (default 3).
.PP
Some remotes can be unreliable and a few retries help pick up the files
which didn\[aq]t get transferred because of errors.
.PP
Disable retries with \f[C]\-\-retries\ 1\f[].
.SS \-\-size\-only
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check only the size.
.PP
This can be useful transferring files from Dropbox which have been
modified by the desktop sync client which doesn\[aq]t set checksums of
modification times in the same way as rclone.
.SS \-\-stats=TIME
.PP
Commands which transfer data (\f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[],
\f[C]copyto\f[], \f[C]move\f[], \f[C]moveto\f[]) will print data
transfer stats at regular intervals to show their progress.
.PP
This sets the interval.
.PP
The default is \f[C]1m\f[].
Use 0 to disable.
.PP
If you set the stats interval then all commands can show stats.
This can be useful when running other commands, \f[C]check\f[] or
\f[C]mount\f[] for example.
.PP
Stats are logged at \f[C]INFO\f[] level by default which means they
won\[aq]t show at default log level \f[C]NOTICE\f[].
Use \f[C]\-\-stats\-log\-level\ NOTICE\f[] or \f[C]\-v\f[] to make them
show.
See the Logging section (#logging) for more info on log levels.
.SS \-\-stats\-log\-level string
.PP
Log level to show \f[C]\-\-stats\f[] output at.
This can be \f[C]DEBUG\f[], \f[C]INFO\f[], \f[C]NOTICE\f[], or
\f[C]ERROR\f[].
The default is \f[C]INFO\f[].
This means at the default level of logging which is \f[C]NOTICE\f[] the
stats won\[aq]t show \- if you want them to then use
\f[C]\-stats\-log\-level\ NOTICE\f[].
See the Logging section (#logging) for more info on log levels.
.SS \-\-stats\-unit=bits|bytes
.PP
By default, data transfer rates will be printed in bytes/second.
.PP
This option allows the data rate to be printed in bits/second.
.PP
Data transfer volume will still be reported in bytes.
.PP
The rate is reported as a binary unit, not SI unit.
So 1 Mbit/s equals 1,048,576 bits/s and not 1,000,000 bits/s.
.PP
The default is \f[C]bytes\f[].
.SS \-\-suffix=SUFFIX
.PP
This is for use with \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir\f[] only.
If this isn\[aq]t set then \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir\f[] will move files with
their original name.
If it is set then the files will have SUFFIX added on to them.
.PP
See \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir\f[] for more info.
.SS \-\-syslog
.PP
On capable OSes (not Windows or Plan9) send all log output to syslog.
.PP
This can be useful for running rclone in a script or
\f[C]rclone\ mount\f[].
.SS \-\-syslog\-facility string
.PP
If using \f[C]\-\-syslog\f[] this sets the syslog facility (eg
\f[C]KERN\f[], \f[C]USER\f[]).
See \f[C]man\ syslog\f[] for a list of possible facilities.
The default facility is \f[C]DAEMON\f[].
.SS \-\-tpslimit float
.PP
Limit HTTP transactions per second to this.
Default is 0 which is used to mean unlimited transactions per second.
.PP
For example to limit rclone to 10 HTTP transactions per second use
\f[C]\-\-tpslimit\ 10\f[], or to 1 transaction every 2 seconds use
\f[C]\-\-tpslimit\ 0.5\f[].
.PP
Use this when the number of transactions per second from rclone is
causing a problem with the cloud storage provider (eg getting you banned
or rate limited).
.PP
This can be very useful for \f[C]rclone\ mount\f[] to control the
behaviour of applications using it.
.PP
See also \f[C]\-\-tpslimit\-burst\f[].
.SS \-\-tpslimit\-burst int
.PP
Max burst of transactions for \f[C]\-\-tpslimit\f[].
(default 1)
.PP
Normally \f[C]\-\-tpslimit\f[] will do exactly the number of transaction
per second specified.
However if you supply \f[C]\-\-tps\-burst\f[] then rclone can save up
some transactions from when it was idle giving a burst of up to the
parameter supplied.
.PP
For example if you provide \f[C]\-\-tpslimit\-burst\ 10\f[] then if
rclone has been idle for more than 10*\f[C]\-\-tpslimit\f[] then it can
do 10 transactions very quickly before they are limited again.
.PP
This may be used to increase performance of \f[C]\-\-tpslimit\f[]
without changing the long term average number of transactions per
second.
.SS \-\-track\-renames
.PP
By default, rclone doesn\[aq]t keep track of renamed files, so if you
rename a file locally then sync it to a remote, rclone will delete the
old file on the remote and upload a new copy.
.PP
If you use this flag, and the remote supports server side copy or server
side move, and the source and destination have a compatible hash, then
this will track renames during \f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[], and
\f[C]move\f[] operations and perform renaming server\-side.
.PP
Files will be matched by size and hash \- if both match then a rename
will be considered.
.PP
If the destination does not support server\-side copy or move, rclone
will fall back to the default behaviour and log an error level message
to the console.
.PP
Note that \f[C]\-\-track\-renames\f[] is incompatible with
\f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[] and that it uses extra memory to keep track of
all the rename candidates.
.PP
Note also that \f[C]\-\-track\-renames\f[] is incompatible with
\f[C]\-\-delete\-before\f[] and will select \f[C]\-\-delete\-after\f[]
instead of \f[C]\-\-delete\-during\f[].
.SS \-\-delete\-(before,during,after)
.PP
This option allows you to specify when files on your destination are
deleted when you sync folders.
.PP
Specifying the value \f[C]\-\-delete\-before\f[] will delete all files
present on the destination, but not on the source \f[I]before\f[]
starting the transfer of any new or updated files.
This uses two passes through the file systems, one for the deletions and
one for the copies.
.PP
Specifying \f[C]\-\-delete\-during\f[] will delete files while checking
and uploading files.
This is the fastest option and uses the least memory.
.PP
Specifying \f[C]\-\-delete\-after\f[] (the default value) will delay
deletion of files until all new/updated files have been successfully
transferred.
The files to be deleted are collected in the copy pass then deleted
after the copy pass has completed successfully.
The files to be deleted are held in memory so this mode may use more
memory.
This is the safest mode as it will only delete files if there have been
no errors subsequent to that.
If there have been errors before the deletions start then you will get
the message \f[C]not\ deleting\ files\ as\ there\ were\ IO\ errors\f[].
.SS \-\-fast\-list
.PP
When doing anything which involves a directory listing (eg
\f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[], \f[C]ls\f[] \- in fact nearly every
command), rclone normally lists a directory and processes it before
using more directory lists to process any subdirectories.
This can be parallelised and works very quickly using the least amount
of memory.
.PP
However, some remotes have a way of listing all files beneath a
directory in one (or a small number) of transactions.
These tend to be the bucket based remotes (eg S3, B2, GCS, Swift,
Hubic).
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] flag then rclone will use this
method for listing directories.
This will have the following consequences for the listing:
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[B]will\f[] use fewer transactions (important if you pay for them)
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[B]will\f[] use more memory.
Rclone has to load the whole listing into memory.
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[I]may\f[] be faster because it uses fewer transactions
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[I]may\f[] be slower because it can\[aq]t be parallelized
.PP
rclone should always give identical results with and without
\f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[].
.PP
If you pay for transactions and can fit your entire sync listing into
memory then \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] is recommended.
If you have a very big sync to do then don\[aq]t use
\f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] otherwise you will run out of memory.
.PP
If you use \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] on a remote which doesn\[aq]t support
it, then rclone will just ignore it.
.SS \-\-timeout=TIME
.PP
This sets the IO idle timeout.
If a transfer has started but then becomes idle for this long it is
considered broken and disconnected.
.PP
The default is \f[C]5m\f[].
Set to 0 to disable.
.SS \-\-transfers=N
.PP
The number of file transfers to run in parallel.
It can sometimes be useful to set this to a smaller number if the remote
is giving a lot of timeouts or bigger if you have lots of bandwidth and
a fast remote.
.PP
The default is to run 4 file transfers in parallel.
.SS \-u, \-\-update
.PP
This forces rclone to skip any files which exist on the destination and
have a modified time that is newer than the source file.
.PP
If an existing destination file has a modification time equal (within
the computed modify window precision) to the source file\[aq]s, it will
be updated if the sizes are different.
.PP
On remotes which don\[aq]t support mod time directly the time checked
will be the uploaded time.
This means that if uploading to one of these remotes, rclone will skip
any files which exist on the destination and have an uploaded time that
is newer than the modification time of the source file.
.PP
This can be useful when transferring to a remote which doesn\[aq]t
support mod times directly as it is more accurate than a
\f[C]\-\-size\-only\f[] check and faster than using
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[].
.SS \-v, \-vv, \-\-verbose
.PP
With \f[C]\-v\f[] rclone will tell you about each file that is
transferred and a small number of significant events.
.PP
With \f[C]\-vv\f[] rclone will become very verbose telling you about
every file it considers and transfers.
Please send bug reports with a log with this setting.
.SS \-V, \-\-version
.PP
Prints the version number
.SS Configuration Encryption
.PP
Your configuration file contains information for logging in to your
cloud services.
This means that you should keep your \f[C]\&.rclone.conf\f[] file in a
secure location.
.PP
If you are in an environment where that isn\[aq]t possible, you can add
a password to your configuration.
This means that you will have to enter the password every time you start
rclone.
.PP
To add a password to your rclone configuration, execute
\f[C]rclone\ config\f[].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
>rclone\ config

e)\ Edit\ existing\ remote
n)\ New\ remote
d)\ Delete\ remote

.PP
Go into \f[C]s\f[], Set configuration password:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
e/n/d/s/q>\ s
Your\ configuration\ is\ not\ encrypted.
If\ you\ add\ a\ password,\ you\ will\ protect\ your\ login\ information\ to\ cloud\ services.

c)\ Change\ Password
u)\ Unencrypt\ configuration
q)\ Quit\ to\ main\ menu
c/u/q>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Your configuration is now encrypted, and every time you start rclone you
will now be asked for the password.
In the same menu, you can change the password or completely remove
encryption from your configuration.
.PP
There is no way to recover the configuration if you lose your password.
.PP
rclone uses nacl
secretbox (https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox) which
in turn uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate your
configuration with secret\-key cryptography.
The password is SHA\-256 hashed, which produces the key for secretbox.
The hashed password is not stored.
.PP
While this provides very good security, we do not recommend storing your
encrypted rclone configuration in public if it contains sensitive
information, maybe except if you use a very strong password.
.PP
If it is safe in your environment, you can set the
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[] environment variable to contain your
password, in which case it will be used for decrypting the
configuration.
.PP
You can set this for a session from a script.
For unix like systems save this to a file called
\f[C]set\-rclone\-password\f[]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#!/bin/echo\ Source\ this\ file\ don\[aq]t\ run\ it

read\ \-s\ RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
export\ RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then source the file when you want to use it.
From the shell you would do \f[C]source\ set\-rclone\-password\f[].
It will then ask you for the password and set it in the environment
variable.
.PP
If you are running rclone inside a script, you might want to disable
password prompts.
To do that, pass the parameter \f[C]\-\-ask\-password=false\f[] to
rclone.
This will make rclone fail instead of asking for a password if
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[] doesn\[aq]t contain a valid password.
.SS Developer options
.PP
These options are useful when developing or debugging rclone.
There are also some more remote specific options which aren\[aq]t
documented here which are used for testing.
These start with remote name eg \f[C]\-\-drive\-test\-option\f[] \- see
the docs for the remote in question.
.SS \-\-cpuprofile=FILE
.PP
Write CPU profile to file.
This can be analysed with \f[C]go\ tool\ pprof\f[].
.SS \-\-dump\-auth
.PP
Dump HTTP headers \- will contain sensitive info such as
\f[C]Authorization:\f[] headers \- use \f[C]\-\-dump\-headers\f[] to
dump without \f[C]Authorization:\f[] headers.
Can be very verbose.
Useful for debugging only.
.SS \-\-dump\-bodies
.PP
Dump HTTP headers and bodies \- may contain sensitive info.
Can be very verbose.
Useful for debugging only.
.PP
Note that the bodies are buffered in memory so don\[aq]t use this for
enormous files.
.SS \-\-dump\-filters
.PP
Dump the filters to the output.
Useful to see exactly what include and exclude options are filtering on.
.SS \-\-dump\-headers
.PP
Dump HTTP headers with \f[C]Authorization:\f[] lines removed.
May still contain sensitive info.
Can be very verbose.
Useful for debugging only.
.PP
Use \f[C]\-\-dump\-auth\f[] if you do want the \f[C]Authorization:\f[]
headers.
.SS \-\-memprofile=FILE
.PP
Write memory profile to file.
This can be analysed with \f[C]go\ tool\ pprof\f[].
.SS \-\-no\-check\-certificate=true/false
.PP
\f[C]\-\-no\-check\-certificate\f[] controls whether a client verifies
the server\[aq]s certificate chain and host name.
If \f[C]\-\-no\-check\-certificate\f[] is true, TLS accepts any
certificate presented by the server and any host name in that
certificate.
In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man\-in\-the\-middle attacks.
.PP
This option defaults to \f[C]false\f[].
.PP
\f[B]This should be used only for testing.\f[]
.SS \-\-no\-traverse
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[] flag controls whether the destination file
system is traversed when using the \f[C]copy\f[] or \f[C]move\f[]
commands.
\f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[] is not compatible with \f[C]sync\f[] and will
be ignored if you supply it with \f[C]sync\f[].
.PP
If you are only copying a small number of files and/or have a large
number of files on the destination then \f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[] will
stop rclone listing the destination and save time.
.PP
However, if you are copying a large number of files, especially if you
are doing a copy where lots of the files haven\[aq]t changed and
won\[aq]t need copying then you shouldn\[aq]t use
\f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[].
.PP
It can also be used to reduce the memory usage of rclone when copying \-
\f[C]rclone\ \-\-no\-traverse\ copy\ src\ dst\f[] won\[aq]t load either
the source or destination listings into memory so will use the minimum
amount of memory.

.SS Logging
.PP
rclone has 4 levels of logging, \f[C]Error\f[], \f[C]Notice\f[],
\f[C]Info\f[] and \f[C]Debug\f[].
.PP
By default, rclone logs to standard error.
This means you can redirect standard error and still see the normal
output of rclone commands (eg \f[C]rclone\ ls\f[]).
.PP
By default, rclone will produce \f[C]Error\f[] and \f[C]Notice\f[] level
messages.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-q\f[] flag, rclone will only produce
\f[C]Error\f[] messages.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag, rclone will produce \f[C]Error\f[],
\f[C]Notice\f[] and \f[C]Info\f[] messages.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-vv\f[] flag, rclone will produce \f[C]Error\f[],
\f[C]Notice\f[], \f[C]Info\f[] and \f[C]Debug\f[] messages.
.PP
You can also control the log levels with the \f[C]\-\-log\-level\f[]
flag.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-\-log\-file=FILE\f[] option, rclone will redirect
\f[C]Error\f[], \f[C]Info\f[] and \f[C]Debug\f[] messages along with
standard error to FILE.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-\-syslog\f[] flag then rclone will log to syslog
and the \f[C]\-\-syslog\-facility\f[] control which facility it uses.
.PP
Rclone prefixes all log messages with their level in capitals, eg INFO
which makes it easy to grep the log file for different kinds of
information.
.SS Exit Code
.PP
If any errors occur during the command execution, rclone will exit with
a non\-zero exit code.
This allows scripts to detect when rclone operations have failed.
.PP
During the startup phase, rclone will exit immediately if an error is
detected in the configuration.
There will always be a log message immediately before exiting.
.PP
When rclone is running it will accumulate errors as it goes along, and
only exit with a non\-zero exit code if (after retries) there were still
failed transfers.
For every error counted there will be a high priority log message
(visible with \f[C]\-q\f[]) showing the message and which file caused
the problem.
A high priority message is also shown when starting a retry so the user
can see that any previous error messages may not be valid after the
retry.
If rclone has done a retry it will log a high priority message if the
retry was successful.
.SS Environment Variables
.PP
Rclone can be configured entirely using environment variables.
These can be used to set defaults for options or config file entries.
.SS Options
.PP
Every option in rclone can have its default set by environment variable.
.PP
To find the name of the environment variable, first, take the long
option name, strip the leading \f[C]\-\-\f[], change \f[C]\-\f[] to
\f[C]_\f[], make upper case and prepend \f[C]RCLONE_\f[].
.PP
For example, to always set \f[C]\-\-stats\ 5s\f[], set the environment
variable \f[C]RCLONE_STATS=5s\f[].
If you set stats on the command line this will override the environment
variable setting.
.PP
Or to always use the trash in drive \f[C]\-\-drive\-use\-trash\f[], set
\f[C]RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH=true\f[].
.PP
The same parser is used for the options and the environment variables so
they take exactly the same form.
.SS Config file
.PP
You can set defaults for values in the config file on an individual
remote basis.
If you want to use this feature, you will need to discover the name of
the config items that you want.
The easiest way is to run through \f[C]rclone\ config\f[] by hand, then
look in the config file to see what the values are (the config file can
be found by looking at the help for \f[C]\-\-config\f[] in
\f[C]rclone\ help\f[]).
.PP
To find the name of the environment variable, you need to set, take
\f[C]RCLONE_\f[] + name of remote + \f[C]_\f[] + name of config file
option and make it all uppercase.
.PP
For example, to configure an S3 remote named \f[C]mys3:\f[] without a
config file (using unix ways of setting environment variables):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ export\ RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_TYPE=s3
$\ export\ RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
$\ export\ RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
$\ rclone\ lsd\ MYS3:
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-1\ 2016\-09\-21\ 12:54:21\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-1\ my\-bucket
$\ rclone\ listremotes\ |\ grep\ mys3
mys3:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that if you want to create a remote using environment variables you
must create the \f[C]\&..._TYPE\f[] variable as above.
.SS Other environment variables
.IP \[bu] 2
RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS` set to contain your config file password (see
Configuration Encryption (#configuration-encryption) section)
.IP \[bu] 2
HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY (or the lowercase versions
thereof).

.SH Configuring rclone on a remote / headless machine
.PP
Some of the configurations (those involving oauth2) require an Internet
connected web browser.
.PP
If you are trying to set rclone up on a remote or headless box with no
browser available on it (eg a NAS or a server in a datacenter) then you
will need to use an alternative means of configuration.
There are two ways of doing it, described below.

.SS Configuring by copying the config file
.PP
Rclone stores all of its config in a single configuration file.
This can easily be copied to configure a remote rclone.
.PP
So first configure rclone on your desktop machine
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ config
\f[]
.fi
.PP
to set up the config file.
.PP
Find the config file by running \f[C]rclone\ \-h\f[] and looking for the

\ \ \ \ \ \ \-\-config="/home/user/.rclone.conf":\ Config\ file.
[snip]
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Now transfer it to the remote box (scp, cut paste, ftp, sftp etc) and
place it in the correct place (use \f[C]rclone\ \-h\f[] on the remote
box to find out where).
.SH Filtering, includes and excludes
.PP
Rclone has a sophisticated set of include and exclude rules.
Some of these are based on patterns and some on other things like file
size.
.PP
The filters are applied for the \f[C]copy\f[], \f[C]sync\f[],
\f[C]move\f[], \f[C]ls\f[], \f[C]lsl\f[], \f[C]md5sum\f[],
\f[C]sha1sum\f[], \f[C]size\f[], \f[C]delete\f[] and \f[C]check\f[]
operations.
Note that \f[C]purge\f[] does not obey the filters.
.PP
Each path as it passes through rclone is matched against the include and
exclude rules like \f[C]\-\-include\f[], \f[C]\-\-exclude\f[],
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[], \f[C]\-\-exclude\-from\f[],
\f[C]\-\-filter\f[], or \f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[].
The simplest way to try them out is using the \f[C]ls\f[] command, or
\f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] together with \f[C]\-v\f[].
.SS Patterns
.PP
The patterns used to match files for inclusion or exclusion are based on
"file globs" as used by the unix shell.
.PP
If the pattern starts with a \f[C]/\f[] then it only matches at the top
level of the directory tree, \f[B]relative to the root of the remote\f[]
(not necessarily the root of the local drive).
If it doesn\[aq]t start with \f[C]/\f[] then it is matched starting at
the \f[B]end of the path\f[], but it will only match a complete path
element:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
file.jpg\ \ \-\ matches\ "file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "directory/file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "afile.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "directory/afile.jpg"
/file.jpg\ \-\ matches\ "file.jpg"\ in\ the\ root\ directory\ of\ the\ remote
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "afile.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "directory/file.jpg"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[] Note that you must use \f[C]/\f[] in patterns and not
\f[C]\\\f[] even if running on Windows.
.PP
A \f[C]*\f[] matches anything but not a \f[C]/\f[].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*.jpg\ \ \-\ matches\ "file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "directory/file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "file.jpg/something"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Use \f[C]**\f[] to match anything, including slashes (\f[C]/\f[]).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
dir/**\ \-\ matches\ "dir/file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "dir/dir1/dir2/file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "directory/file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "adir/file.jpg"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
A \f[C]?\f[] matches any character except a slash \f[C]/\f[].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
l?ss\ \ \-\ matches\ "less"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "lass"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "floss"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
A \f[C][\f[] and \f[C]]\f[] together make a a character class, such as
\f[C][a\-z]\f[] or \f[C][aeiou]\f[] or \f[C][[:alpha:]]\f[].
See the go regexp docs (https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/) for more
info on these.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
h[ae]llo\ \-\ matches\ "hello"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "hallo"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "hullo"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
A \f[C]{\f[] and \f[C]}\f[] define a choice between elements.
It should contain a comma seperated list of patterns, any of which might
match.
These patterns can contain wildcards.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{one,two}_potato\ \-\ matches\ "one_potato"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "two_potato"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "three_potato"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "_potato"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Special characters can be escaped with a \f[C]\\\f[] before them.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\\*.jpg\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "*.jpg"
\\\\.jpg\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "\\.jpg"
\\[one\\].jpg\ \ \-\ matches\ "[one].jpg"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note also that rclone filter globs can only be used in one of the filter
command line flags, not in the specification of the remote, so
\f[C]rclone\ copy\ "remote:dir*.jpg"\ /path/to/dir\f[] won\[aq]t work \-
what is required is
\f[C]rclone\ \-\-include\ "*.jpg"\ copy\ remote:dir\ /path/to/dir\f[]
.SS Directories
.PP
Rclone keeps track of directories that could match any file patterns.
.PP
Eg if you add the include rule
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/a/*.jpg
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Rclone will synthesize the directory include rule
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/a/
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you put any rules which end in \f[C]/\f[] then it will only match
directories.
.PP
Directory matches are \f[B]only\f[] used to optimise directory access
patterns \- you must still match the files that you want to match.
Directory matches won\[aq]t optimise anything on bucket based remotes
(eg s3, swift, google compute storage, b2) which don\[aq]t have a
concept of directory.
.SS Differences between rsync and rclone patterns
.PP
Rclone implements bash style \f[C]{a,b,c}\f[] glob matching which rsync
doesn\[aq]t.
.PP
Rclone always does a wildcard match so \f[C]\\\f[] must always escape a
\f[C]\\\f[].
.SS How the rules are used
.PP
Rclone maintains a combined list of include rules and exclude rules.
.PP
Each file is matched in order, starting from the top, against the rule
in the list until it finds a match.
The file is then included or excluded according to the rule type.
.PP
If the matcher fails to find a match after testing against all the
entries in the list then the path is included.
.PP
For example given the following rules, \f[C]+\f[] being include,
\f[C]\-\f[] being exclude,
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\ secret*.jpg
+\ *.jpg
+\ *.png
+\ file2.avi
\-\ *
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This would include
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]file1.jpg\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]file3.png\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]file2.avi\f[]
.PP
This would exclude
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]secret17.jpg\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
non \f[C]*.jpg\f[] and \f[C]*.png\f[]
.PP
A similar process is done on directory entries before recursing into
them.
This only works on remotes which have a concept of directory (Eg local,
google drive, onedrive, amazon drive) and not on bucket based remotes
(eg s3, swift, google compute storage, b2).
.SS Adding filtering rules
.PP
Filtering rules are added with the following command line flags.
.SS Repeating options
.PP
You can repeat the following options to add more than one rule of that
type.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-exclude\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-exclude\-from\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-filter\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[]
.PP
Note that all the options of the same type are processed together in the
order above, regardless of what order they were placed on the command
line.
.PP
So all \f[C]\-\-include\f[] options are processed first in the order
they appeared on the command line, then all \f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[]
options etc.
.PP
To mix up the order includes and excludes, the \f[C]\-\-filter\f[] flag
can be used.
.SS \f[C]\-\-exclude\f[] \- Exclude files matching pattern
.PP
Add a single exclude rule with \f[C]\-\-exclude\f[].
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Eg \f[C]\-\-exclude\ *.bak\f[] to exclude all bak files from the sync.
.SS \f[C]\-\-exclude\-from\f[] \- Read exclude patterns from file
.PP
Add exclude rules from a file.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Prepare a file like this \f[C]exclude\-file.txt\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ a\ sample\ exclude\ rule\ file
*.bak
file2.jpg
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then use as \f[C]\-\-exclude\-from\ exclude\-file.txt\f[].
This will sync all files except those ending in \f[C]bak\f[] and
\f[C]file2.jpg\f[].
.PP
This is useful if you have a lot of rules.
.SS \f[C]\-\-include\f[] \- Include files matching pattern
.PP
Add a single include rule with \f[C]\-\-include\f[].
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Eg \f[C]\-\-include\ *.{png,jpg}\f[] to include all \f[C]png\f[] and
\f[C]jpg\f[] files in the backup and no others.
.PP
This adds an implicit \f[C]\-\-exclude\ *\f[] at the very end of the
filter list.
This means you can mix \f[C]\-\-include\f[] and
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[] with the other filters (eg
\f[C]\-\-exclude\f[]) but you must include all the files you want in the
include statement.
If this doesn\[aq]t provide enough flexibility then you must use
\f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[].
.SS \f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[] \- Read include patterns from file
.PP
Add include rules from a file.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Prepare a file like this \f[C]include\-file.txt\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ a\ sample\ include\ rule\ file
*.jpg
*.png
file2.avi
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then use as \f[C]\-\-include\-from\ include\-file.txt\f[].
This will sync all \f[C]jpg\f[], \f[C]png\f[] files and
\f[C]file2.avi\f[].
.PP
This is useful if you have a lot of rules.
.PP
This adds an implicit \f[C]\-\-exclude\ *\f[] at the very end of the
filter list.
This means you can mix \f[C]\-\-include\f[] and
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[] with the other filters (eg
\f[C]\-\-exclude\f[]) but you must include all the files you want in the
include statement.
If this doesn\[aq]t provide enough flexibility then you must use
\f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[].
.SS \f[C]\-\-filter\f[] \- Add a file\-filtering rule
.PP
This can be used to add a single include or exclude rule.
Include rules start with \f[C]+\f[] and exclude rules start with
\f[C]\-\f[].
A special rule called \f[C]!\f[] can be used to clear the existing
rules.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Eg \f[C]\-\-filter\ "\-\ *.bak"\f[] to exclude all bak files from the
sync.
.SS \f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[] \- Read filtering patterns from a file
.PP
Add include/exclude rules from a file.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Prepare a file like this \f[C]filter\-file.txt\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ a\ sample\ filter\ rule\ file
\-\ secret*.jpg
+\ *.jpg
+\ *.png
+\ file2.avi
\-\ /dir/Trash/**
+\ /dir/**
#\ exclude\ everything\ else
\-\ *
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then use as \f[C]\-\-filter\-from\ filter\-file.txt\f[].
The rules are processed in the order that they are defined.
.PP
This example will include all \f[C]jpg\f[] and \f[C]png\f[] files,
exclude any files matching \f[C]secret*.jpg\f[] and include
\f[C]file2.avi\f[].
It will also include everything in the directory \f[C]dir\f[] at the
root of the sync, except \f[C]dir/Trash\f[] which it will exclude.
Everything else will be excluded from the sync.
.SS \f[C]\-\-files\-from\f[] \- Read list of source\-file names
.PP
This reads a list of file names from the file passed in and
\f[B]only\f[] these files are transferred.
The filtering rules are ignored completely if you use this option.
.PP
This option can be repeated to read from more than one file.
These are read in the order that they are placed on the command line.
.PP
Prepare a file like this \f[C]files\-from.txt\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ comment
file1.jpg
file2.jpg
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then use as \f[C]\-\-files\-from\ files\-from.txt\f[].
This will only transfer \f[C]file1.jpg\f[] and \f[C]file2.jpg\f[]
providing they exist.
.PP
For example, let\[aq]s say you had a few files you want to back up
regularly with these absolute paths:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/important
/home/user1/dir/file
/home/user2/stuff
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To copy these you\[aq]d find a common subdirectory \- in this case
\f[C]/home\f[] and put the remaining files in \f[C]files\-from.txt\f[]
with or without leading \f[C]/\f[], eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
user1/important
user1/dir/file
user2/stuff
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You could then copy these to a remote like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ \-\-files\-from\ files\-from.txt\ /home\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The 3 files will arrive in \f[C]remote:backup\f[] with the paths as in
the \f[C]files\-from.txt\f[].
.PP
You could of course choose \f[C]/\f[] as the root too in which case your
\f[C]files\-from.txt\f[] might look like this.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/important
/home/user1/dir/file
/home/user2/stuff
\f[]
.fi
.PP
And you would transfer it like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ \-\-files\-from\ files\-from.txt\ /\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
In this case there will be an extra \f[C]home\f[] directory on the
remote.
.SS \f[C]\-\-min\-size\f[] \- Don\[aq]t transfer any file smaller than
this
.PP
This option controls the minimum size file which will be transferred.
This defaults to \f[C]kBytes\f[] but a suffix of \f[C]k\f[], \f[C]M\f[],
or \f[C]G\f[] can be used.
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-min\-size\ 50k\f[] means no files smaller than
50kByte will be transferred.
.SS \f[C]\-\-max\-size\f[] \- Don\[aq]t transfer any file larger than
this
.PP
This option controls the maximum size file which will be transferred.
This defaults to \f[C]kBytes\f[] but a suffix of \f[C]k\f[], \f[C]M\f[],
or \f[C]G\f[] can be used.
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-max\-size\ 1G\f[] means no files larger than 1GByte
will be transferred.
.SS \f[C]\-\-max\-age\f[] \- Don\[aq]t transfer any file older than this
.PP
This option controls the maximum age of files to transfer.
Give in seconds or with a suffix of:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]ms\f[] \- Milliseconds
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]s\f[] \- Seconds
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]m\f[] \- Minutes
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]h\f[] \- Hours
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]d\f[] \- Days
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]w\f[] \- Weeks
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]M\f[] \- Months
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]y\f[] \- Years
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-max\-age\ 2d\f[] means no files older than 2 days
will be transferred.
.SS \f[C]\-\-min\-age\f[] \- Don\[aq]t transfer any file younger than
this
.PP
This option controls the minimum age of files to transfer.
Give in seconds or with a suffix (see \f[C]\-\-max\-age\f[] for list of
suffixes)
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-min\-age\ 2d\f[] means no files younger than 2 days
will be transferred.
.SS \f[C]\-\-delete\-excluded\f[] \- Delete files on dest excluded from
sync
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[] this flag is dangerous \- use with
\f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] and \f[C]\-v\f[] first.
.PP
When doing \f[C]rclone\ sync\f[] this will delete any files which are
excluded from the sync on the destination.
.PP
If for example you did a sync from \f[C]A\f[] to \f[C]B\f[] without the
\f[C]\-\-min\-size\ 50k\f[] flag
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ A:\ B:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then you repeated it like this with the \f[C]\-\-delete\-excluded\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ \-\-min\-size\ 50k\ \-\-delete\-excluded\ sync\ A:\ B:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This would delete all files on \f[C]B\f[] which are less than 50 kBytes
as these are now excluded from the sync.
.PP
Always test first with \f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] and \f[C]\-v\f[] before
using this flag.
.SS \f[C]\-\-dump\-filters\f[] \- dump the filters to the output
.PP
This dumps the defined filters to the output as regular expressions.
.PP
Useful for debugging.
.SS Quoting shell metacharacters
.PP
The examples above may not work verbatim in your shell as they have
shell metacharacters in them (eg \f[C]*\f[]), and may require quoting.
.PP
Eg linux, OSX
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include\ \\*.jpg\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include\ \[aq]*.jpg\[aq]\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include=\[aq]*.jpg\[aq]\f[]
.PP
In Windows the expansion is done by the command not the shell so this
should work fine
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include\ *.jpg\f[]
.SH Overview of cloud storage systems

.SS Hash
.PP
The cloud storage system supports various hash types of the objects.
The hashes are used when transferring data as an integrity check and can
be specifically used with the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag in syncs and in
the \f[C]check\f[] command.
.PP
To use the verify checksums when transferring between cloud storage
systems they must support a common hash type.
.PP
† Note that Dropbox supports its own custom
hash (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/content-hash).
This is an SHA256 sum of all the 4MB block SHA256s.
.PP
‡ SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and
\f[C]md5sum\f[] or \f[C]sha1sum\f[] as well as \f[C]echo\f[] are in the
remote\[aq]s PATH.
.SS ModTime
.PP
The cloud storage system supports setting modification times on objects.
If it does then this enables a using the modification times as part of
the sync.
If not then only the size will be checked by default, though the MD5SUM
can be checked with the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.PP
All cloud storage systems support some kind of date on the object and
these will be set when transferring from the cloud storage system.
.SS Case Insensitive
.PP
If a cloud storage systems is case sensitive then it is possible to have
two files which differ only in case, eg \f[C]file.txt\f[] and
\f[C]FILE.txt\f[].
If a cloud storage system is case insensitive then that isn\[aq]t
possible.
.PP
This can cause problems when syncing between a case insensitive system
and a case sensitive system.
The symptom of this is that no matter how many times you run the sync it
never completes fully.
.PP
The local filesystem and SFTP may or may not be case sensitive depending
on OS.
.IP \[bu] 2
Windows \- usually case insensitive, though case is preserved
.IP \[bu] 2
OSX \- usually case insensitive, though it is possible to format case
sensitive
.IP \[bu] 2
Linux \- usually case sensitive, but there are case insensitive file
systems (eg FAT formatted USB keys)
.PP
Most of the time this doesn\[aq]t cause any problems as people tend to
avoid files whose name differs only by case even on case sensitive
systems.
.SS Duplicate files
.PP
If a cloud storage system allows duplicate files then it can have two
objects with the same name.
.PP
This confuses rclone greatly when syncing \- use the
\f[C]rclone\ dedupe\f[] command to rename or remove duplicates.
.SS MIME Type
.PP
MIME types (also known as media types) classify types of documents using
a simple text classification, eg \f[C]text/html\f[] or
\f[C]application/pdf\f[].
.PP
Some cloud storage systems support reading (\f[C]R\f[]) the MIME type of
objects and some support writing (\f[C]W\f[]) the MIME type of objects.
.PP
The MIME type can be important if you are serving files directly to HTTP
from the storage system.
.PP
If you are copying from a remote which supports reading (\f[C]R\f[]) to
a remote which supports writing (\f[C]W\f[]) then rclone will preserve
the MIME types.
Otherwise they will be guessed from the extension, or the remote itself
may assign the MIME type.
.SS Optional Features
.PP
All the remotes support a basic set of features, but there are some
optional features supported by some remotes used to make some operations
more efficient.

.TE
.SS Purge
.PP
This deletes a directory quicker than just deleting all the files in the
directory.
.PP
† Note Swift and Hubic implement this in order to delete directory
markers but they don\[aq]t actually have a quicker way of deleting files
other than deleting them individually.
.SS Copy
.PP
Used when copying an object to and from the same remote.
This known as a server side copy so you can copy a file without
downloading it and uploading it again.
It is used if you use \f[C]rclone\ copy\f[] or \f[C]rclone\ move\f[] if
the remote doesn\[aq]t support \f[C]Move\f[] directly.
.PP
If the server doesn\[aq]t support \f[C]Copy\f[] directly then for copy
operations the file is downloaded then re\-uploaded.
.SS Move
.PP
Used when moving/renaming an object on the same remote.
This is known as a server side move of a file.
This is used in \f[C]rclone\ move\f[] if the server doesn\[aq]t support
\f[C]DirMove\f[].
.PP
If the server isn\[aq]t capable of \f[C]Move\f[] then rclone simulates
it with \f[C]Copy\f[] then delete.
If the server doesn\[aq]t support \f[C]Copy\f[] then rclone will
download the file and re\-upload it.
.SS DirMove
.PP
This is used to implement \f[C]rclone\ move\f[] to move a directory if
possible.
If it isn\[aq]t then it will use \f[C]Move\f[] on each file (which falls
back to \f[C]Copy\f[] then download and upload \- see \f[C]Move\f[]
section).
.SS CleanUp
.PP
This is used for emptying the trash for a remote by
\f[C]rclone\ cleanup\f[].
.PP
If the server can\[aq]t do \f[C]CleanUp\f[] then
\f[C]rclone\ cleanup\f[] will return an error.
.SS ListR
.PP
The remote supports a recursive list to list all the contents beneath a
directory quickly.
This enables the \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] flag to work.
See the rclone docs (/docs/#fast-list) for more details.
.SS StreamUpload
.PP
Some remotes allow files to be uploaded without knowing the file size in
advance.
This allows certain operations to work without spooling the file to
local disk first, e.g.
\f[C]rclone\ rcat\f[].
.SS Amazon Drive
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[].
.PP
The initial setup for Amazon Drive involves getting a token from Amazon
which you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone\ config\f[] walks you through it.
.PP
The configuration process for Amazon Drive may involve using an oauth
proxy (https://github.com/ncw/oauthproxy).
This is used to keep the Amazon credentials out of the source code.
The proxy runs in Google\[aq]s very secure App Engine environment and
doesn\[aq]t store any credentials which pass through it.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[] rclone doesn\[aq]t not currently have its own Amazon Drive
credentials (see the
forum (https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-has-been-banned-from-amazon-drive/)
for why) so you will either need to have your own \f[C]client_id\f[] and
\f[C]client_secret\f[] with Amazon Drive, or use a a third party ouath
proxy in which case you will need to enter \f[C]client_id\f[],
\f[C]client_secret\f[], \f[C]auth_url\f[] and \f[C]token_url\f[].
.PP
Note also if you are not using Amazon\[aq]s \f[C]auth_url\f[] and
\f[C]token_url\f[], (ie you filled in something for those) then if
setting up on a remote machine you can only use the copying the config
method of
configuration (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/#configuring-by-copying-the-config-file)
\- \f[C]rclone\ authorize\f[] will not work.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[].

.fi
.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Amazon.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[] like this,
.PP
List directories in top level of your Amazon Drive
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ lsd\ remote:
\f[]
.fi
.PP

\f[C]
rclone\ ls\ remote:

.fi
.PP
To copy a local directory to an Amazon Drive directory called backup
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ /home/source\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.SS Modified time and MD5SUMs
.PP
Amazon Drive doesn\[aq]t allow modification times to be changed via the
API so these won\[aq]t be accurate or used for syncing.
.PP
It does store MD5SUMs so for a more accurate sync, you can use the
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.
Amazon don\[aq]t provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to
empty the trash, so you will have to do that with one of Amazon\[aq]s
apps or via the Amazon Drive website.
As of November 17, 2016, files are automatically deleted by Amazon from
the trash after 30 days.
.SS Using with non \f[C]\&.com\f[] Amazon accounts
.PP
Let\[aq]s say you usually use \f[C]amazon.co.uk\f[].
When you authenticate with rclone it will take you to an
\f[C]amazon.com\f[] page to log in.
Your \f[C]amazon.co.uk\f[] email and password should work here just
fine.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-acd\-templink\-threshold=SIZE
.PP
Files this size or more will be downloaded via their \f[C]tempLink\f[].
This is to work around a problem with Amazon Drive which blocks
downloads of files bigger than about 10GB.
The default for this is 9GB which shouldn\[aq]t need to be changed.
.PP
To download files above this threshold, rclone requests a
\f[C]tempLink\f[] which downloads the file through a temporary URL
directly from the underlying S3 storage.
.SS \-\-acd\-upload\-wait\-per\-gb=TIME
.PP
Sometimes Amazon Drive gives an error when a file has been fully
uploaded but the file appears anyway after a little while.
This happens sometimes for files over 1GB in size and nearly every time
for files bigger than 10GB.
This parameter controls the time rclone waits for the file to appear.
.PP
The default value for this parameter is 3 minutes per GB, so by default
it will wait 3 minutes for every GB uploaded to see if the file appears.
.PP
You can disable this feature by setting it to 0.
This may cause conflict errors as rclone retries the failed upload but
the file will most likely appear correctly eventually.
.PP
These values were determined empirically by observing lots of uploads of
big files for a range of file sizes.
.PP
Upload with the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag to see more info about what rclone is
doing in this situation.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Amazon Drive is case insensitive so you can\[aq]t have a file
called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".
.PP
Amazon Drive has rate limiting so you may notice errors in the sync (429
errors).
rclone will automatically retry the sync up to 3 times by default (see
\f[C]\-\-retries\f[] flag) which should hopefully work around this
problem.
.PP
Amazon Drive has an internal limit of file sizes that can be uploaded to
the service.
This limit is not officially published, but all files larger than this
will fail.
.PP
At the time of writing (Jan 2016) is in the area of 50GB per file.
This means that larger files are likely to fail.
.PP
Unfortunately there is no way for rclone to see that this failure is
because of file size, so it will retry the operation, as any other
failure.
To avoid this problem, use \f[C]\-\-max\-size\ 50000M\f[] option to
limit the maximum size of uploaded files.
Note that \f[C]\-\-max\-size\f[] does not split files into segments, it
only ignores files over this size.
.SS Amazon S3
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:bucket\f[] (or \f[C]remote:\f[] for
the \f[C]lsd\f[] command.) You may put subdirectories in too, eg
\f[C]remote:bucket/path/to/dir\f[].
.PP
Here is an example of making an s3 configuration.
First run

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

See the rclone docs (/docs/#fast-list) for more details.
.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X\-Amz\-Meta\-Mtime\f[] as floating point since the epoch accurate
to 1 ns.
.SS Multipart uploads
.PP
rclone supports multipart uploads with S3 which means that it can upload
files bigger than 5GB.
Note that files uploaded with multipart upload don\[aq]t have an MD5SUM.
.SS Buckets and Regions
.PP
With Amazon S3 you can list buckets (\f[C]rclone\ lsd\f[]) using any
region, but you can only access the content of a bucket from the region
it was created in.
If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong region, you will get an
error,
\f[C]incorrect\ region,\ the\ bucket\ is\ not\ in\ \[aq]XXX\[aq]\ region\f[].
.SS Authentication
.PP
There are two ways to supply \f[C]rclone\f[] with a set of AWS
credentials.
In order of precedence:
.IP \[bu] 2
Directly in the rclone configuration file (as configured by
\f[C]rclone\ config\f[])
.IP \[bu] 2
set \f[C]access_key_id\f[] and \f[C]secret_access_key\f[].
\f[C]session_token\f[] can be optionally set when using AWS STS.
.IP \[bu] 2
Runtime configuration:
.IP \[bu] 2
set \f[C]env_auth\f[] to \f[C]true\f[] in the config file
.IP \[bu] 2
Exporting the following environment variables before running
\f[C]rclone\f[]
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
Access Key ID: \f[C]AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\f[] or \f[C]AWS_ACCESS_KEY\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
Secret Access Key: \f[C]AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\f[] or
\f[C]AWS_SECRET_KEY\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
Session Token: \f[C]AWS_SESSION_TOKEN\f[]
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Running \f[C]rclone\f[] on an EC2 instance with an IAM role
.PP
If none of these option actually end up providing \f[C]rclone\f[] with
AWS credentials then S3 interaction will be non\-authenticated (see
below).
.SS S3 Permissions
.PP
When using the \f[C]sync\f[] subcommand of \f[C]rclone\f[] the following
minimum permissions are required to be available on the bucket being
written to:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]ListBucket\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]DeleteObject\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]GetObject\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]PutObject\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]PutObjectACL\f[]
.PP

\ \ \ \ ]
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Notes on above:
.IP "1." 3
This is a policy that can be used when creating bucket.
It assumes that \f[C]USER_NAME\f[] has been created.
.IP "2." 3
The Resource entry must include both resource ARNs, as one implies the
bucket and the other implies the bucket\[aq]s objects.
.PP
For reference, here\[aq]s an Ansible
script (https://gist.github.com/ebridges/ebfc9042dd7c756cd101cfa807b7ae2b)
that will generate one or more buckets that will work with
\f[C]rclone\ sync\f[].
.SS Glacier
.PP
You can transition objects to glacier storage using a lifecycle
policy (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-lifecycle.html).
The bucket can still be synced or copied into normally, but if rclone
tries to access the data you will see an error like below.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
2017/09/11\ 19:07:43\ Failed\ to\ sync:\ failed\ to\ open\ source\ object:\ Object\ in\ GLACIER,\ restore\ first:\ path/to/file
\f[]
.fi
.PP
In this case you need to
restore (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/restore-archived-objects.html)
the object(s) in question before using rclone.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-s3\-acl=STRING
.PP
Canned ACL used when creating buckets and/or storing objects in S3.
.PP
For more info visit the canned ACL
docs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl).
.SS \-\-s3\-storage\-class=STRING
.PP
Storage class to upload new objects with.
.PP
Available options include:
.IP \[bu] 2
STANDARD \- default storage class
.IP \[bu] 2
STANDARD_IA \- for less frequently accessed data (e.g backups)
.IP \[bu] 2
REDUCED_REDUNDANCY (only for noncritical, reproducible data, has lower
redundancy)
.SS Anonymous access to public buckets
.PP
If you want to use rclone to access a public bucket, configure with a
blank \f[C]access_key_id\f[] and \f[C]secret_access_key\f[].
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then use it as normal with the name of the public bucket, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ lsd\ anons3:1000genomes
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You will be able to list and copy data but not upload it.
.SS Ceph
.PP
Ceph is an object storage system which presents an Amazon S3 interface.
.PP
To use rclone with ceph, you need to set the following parameters in the
config.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
access_key_id\ =\ Whatever
secret_access_key\ =\ Whatever
endpoint\ =\ https://ceph.endpoint.goes.here/
region\ =\ other\-v2\-signature
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note also that Ceph sometimes puts \f[C]/\f[] in the passwords it gives
users.
If you read the secret access key using the command line tools you will
get a JSON blob with the \f[C]/\f[] escaped as \f[C]\\/\f[].
Make sure you only write \f[C]/\f[] in the secret access key.
.PP
Eg the dump from Ceph looks something like this (irrelevant keys
removed).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
\ \ \ \ "user_id":\ "xxx",
\ \ \ \ "display_name":\ "xxxx",
\ \ \ \ "keys":\ [
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "user":\ "xxx",
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "access_key":\ "xxxxxx",
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "secret_key":\ "xxxxxx\\/xxxx"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }
\ \ \ \ ],
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Because this is a json dump, it is encoding the \f[C]/\f[] as
\f[C]\\/\f[], so if you use the secret key as \f[C]xxxxxx/xxxx\f[] it
will work fine.
.SS Minio
.PP
Minio (https://minio.io/) is an object storage server built for cloud
application developers and devops.
.PP
It is very easy to install and provides an S3 compatible server which
can be used by rclone.
.PP
To use it, install Minio following the instructions
here (https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide).
.PP
When it configures itself Minio will print something like this

.SS \-\-fast\-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] which allows you to use
fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (/docs/#fast-list) for more details.
.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X\-Bz\-Info\-src_last_modified_millis\f[] as milliseconds since
1970\-01\-01 in the Backblaze standard.
Other tools should be able to use this as a modified time.
.PP
Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported except in the
case of updating a modification time on an existing object.
In this case the object will be uploaded again as B2 doesn\[aq]t have an
API method to set the modification time independent of doing an upload.
.SS SHA1 checksums
.PP
The SHA1 checksums of the files are checked on upload and download and
will be used in the syncing process.
.PP
Large files which are uploaded in chunks will store their SHA1 on the
object as \f[C]X\-Bz\-Info\-large_file_sha1\f[] as recommended by
Backblaze.
.SS Transfers
.PP
Backblaze recommends that you do lots of transfers simultaneously for
maximum speed.
In tests from my SSD equiped laptop the optimum setting is about
\f[C]\-\-transfers\ 32\f[] though higher numbers may be used for a
slight speed improvement.
The optimum number for you may vary depending on your hardware, how big
the files are, how much you want to load your computer, etc.
The default of \f[C]\-\-transfers\ 4\f[] is definitely too low for
Backblaze B2 though.
.PP
Note that uploading big files (bigger than 200 MB by default) will use a
96 MB RAM buffer by default.
There can be at most \f[C]\-\-transfers\f[] of these in use at any
moment, so this sets the upper limit on the memory used.
.SS Versions
.PP
When rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a new version of
it (https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/file_versions.html).
Likewise when you delete a file, the old version will be marked hidden
and still be available.
Conversely, you may opt in to a "hard delete" of files with the
\f[C]\-\-b2\-hard\-delete\f[] flag which would permanently remove the
file instead of hiding it.
.PP
Old versions of files, where available, are visible using the
\f[C]\-\-b2\-versions\f[] flag.
.PP
If you wish to remove all the old versions then you can use the
\f[C]rclone\ cleanup\ remote:bucket\f[] command which will delete all
the old versions of files, leaving the current ones intact.
You can also supply a path and only old versions under that path will be
deleted, eg \f[C]rclone\ cleanup\ remote:bucket/path/to/stuff\f[].
.PP
When you \f[C]purge\f[] a bucket, the current and the old versions will
be deleted then the bucket will be deleted.
.PP
However \f[C]delete\f[] will cause the current versions of the files to
become hidden old versions.
.PP
Here is a session showing the listing and and retreival of an old
version followed by a \f[C]cleanup\f[] of the old versions.
.PP
Show current version and all the versions with \f[C]\-\-b2\-versions\f[]

.fi
.PP
The \f[C]b2_list_file_names\f[] request will be sent once for every 1k
files in the remote path, providing the checksum and modification time
of the listed files.
As of version 1.33 issue #818 (https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/818)
causes extra requests to be sent when using B2 with Crypt.
When a copy operation does not require any files to be uploaded, no more
requests will be sent.
.PP
Uploading files that do not require chunking, will send 2 requests per
file upload:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_url
/b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Uploading files requiring chunking, will send 2 requests (one each to
start and finish the upload) and another 2 requests for each chunk:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/b2api/v1/b2_start_large_file
/b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_part_url

\f[]
.fi
.SS B2 with crypt
.PP
When using B2 with \f[C]crypt\f[] files are encrypted into a temporary
location and streamed from there.
This is required to calculate the encrypted file\[aq]s checksum before
beginning the upload.
On Windows the %TMPDIR% environment variable is used as the temporary
location.
If the file requires chunking, both the chunking and encryption will
take place in memory.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-b2\-chunk\-size valuee=SIZE
.PP
When uploading large files chunk the file into this size.
Note that these chunks are buffered in memory and there might a maximum
of \f[C]\-\-transfers\f[] chunks in progress at once.
5,000,000 Bytes is the minimim size (default 96M).
.SS \-\-b2\-upload\-cutoff=SIZE
.PP
Cutoff for switching to chunked upload (default 190.735 MiB == 200 MB).
Files above this size will be uploaded in chunks of
\f[C]\-\-b2\-chunk\-size\f[].
.PP
This value should be set no larger than 4.657GiB (== 5GB) as this is the
largest file size that can be uploaded.
.SS \-\-b2\-test\-mode=FLAG
.PP
This is for debugging purposes only.
.PP
Setting FLAG to one of the strings below will cause b2 to return
specific errors for debugging purposes.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]fail_some_uploads\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]expire_some_account_authorization_tokens\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]force_cap_exceeded\f[]
.PP
These will be set in the \f[C]X\-Bz\-Test\-Mode\f[] header which is
documented in the b2 integrations
checklist (https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/integration_checklist.html).
.SS \-\-b2\-versions
.PP
When set rclone will show and act on older versions of files.
For example
.PP

seen.
These have the UTC date that they were uploaded to the server to the
nearest millisecond appended to them.
.PP
Note that when using \f[C]\-\-b2\-versions\f[] no file write operations
are permitted, so you can\[aq]t upload files or delete them.
.SS Box
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[].
.PP
The initial setup for Box involves getting a token from Box which you
need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone\ config\f[] walks you through it.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[].

.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Box.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[] like this,
.PP

.RS
.PP
Each refresh_token is valid for one use in 60 days.
.RE
.PP
This means that if you
.IP \[bu] 2
Don\[aq]t use the box remote for 60 days
.IP \[bu] 2
Copy the config file with a box refresh token in and use it in two
places
.IP \[bu] 2
Get an error on a token refresh
.PP
then rclone will return an error which includes the text
\f[C]Invalid\ refresh\ token\f[].
.PP
To fix this you will need to use oauth2 again to update the refresh
token.
You can use the methods in the remote setup
docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/), bearing in mind that if you use
the copy the config file method, you should not use that remote on the
computer you did the authentication on.

.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
Box allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1 second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
.PP
One drive supports SHA1 type hashes, so you can use the
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.SS Transfers
.PP
For files above 50MB rclone will use a chunked transfer.
Rclone will upload up to \f[C]\-\-transfers\f[] chunks at the same time
(shared among all the multipart uploads).
Chunks are buffered in memory and are normally 8MB so increasing
\f[C]\-\-transfers\f[] will increase memory use.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Depending on the enterprise settings for your user, the item will either
be actually deleted from Box or moved to the trash.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-box\-upload\-cutoff=SIZE
.PP
Cutoff for switching to chunked upload \- must be >= 50MB.
The default is 50MB.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Box is case insensitive so you can\[aq]t have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".
.PP
Box file names can\[aq]t have the \f[C]\\\f[] character in.
rclone maps this to and from an identical looking unicode equivalent
\f[C]＼\f[].
.PP
Box only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.
.SS Crypt
.PP
The \f[C]crypt\f[] remote encrypts and decrypts another remote.
.PP
To use it first set up the underlying remote following the config
instructions for that remote.
You can also use a local pathname instead of a remote which will encrypt
and decrypt from that directory which might be useful for encrypting
onto a USB stick for example.
.PP
First check your chosen remote is working \- we\[aq]ll call it
\f[C]remote:path\f[] in these docs.
Note that anything inside \f[C]remote:path\f[] will be encrypted and
anything outside won\[aq]t.
This means that if you are using a bucket based remote (eg S3, B2,
swift) then you should probably put the bucket in the remote
\f[C]s3:bucket\f[].
If you just use \f[C]s3:\f[] then rclone will make encrypted bucket
names too (if using file name encryption) which may or may not be what
you want.
.PP
Now configure \f[C]crypt\f[] using \f[C]rclone\ config\f[].
We will call this one \f[C]secret\f[] to differentiate it from the
\f[C]remote\f[].

\f[B]Important\f[] The password is stored in the config file is lightly
obscured so it isn\[aq]t immediately obvious what it is.
It is in no way secure unless you use config file encryption.
.PP
A long passphrase is recommended, or you can use a random one.
Note that if you reconfigure rclone with the same passwords/passphrases
elsewhere it will be compatible \- all the secrets used are derived from
those two passwords/passphrases.
.PP
Note that rclone does not encrypt
.IP \[bu] 2
file length \- this can be calcuated within 16 bytes
.IP \[bu] 2
modification time \- used for syncing
.SS Specifying the remote
.PP
In normal use, make sure the remote has a \f[C]:\f[] in.
If you specify the remote without a \f[C]:\f[] then rclone will use a
local directory of that name.
So if you use a remote of \f[C]/path/to/secret/files\f[] then rclone
will encrypt stuff to that directory.
If you use a remote of \f[C]name\f[] then rclone will put files in a
directory called \f[C]name\f[] in the current directory.
.PP
If you specify the remote as \f[C]remote:path/to/dir\f[] then rclone
will store encrypted files in \f[C]path/to/dir\f[] on the remote.
If you are using file name encryption, then when you save files to
\f[C]secret:subdir/subfile\f[] this will store them in the unencrypted
path \f[C]path/to/dir\f[] but the \f[C]subdir/subpath\f[] bit will be
encrypted.
.PP
Note that unless you want encrypted bucket names (which are difficult to
manage because you won\[aq]t know what directory they represent in web
interfaces etc), you should probably specify a bucket, eg
\f[C]remote:secretbucket\f[] when using bucket based remotes such as S3,
Swift, Hubic, B2, GCS.

.SS File name encryption modes
.PP
Here are some of the features of the file name encryption modes
.PP
Off
.IP \[bu] 2
doesn\[aq]t hide file names or directory structure
.IP \[bu] 2
allows for longer file names (~246 characters)
.IP \[bu] 2
can use sub paths and copy single files
.PP
Standard
.IP \[bu] 2
file names encrypted
.IP \[bu] 2
file names can\[aq]t be as long (~156 characters)
.IP \[bu] 2
can use sub paths and copy single files
.IP \[bu] 2
directory structure visibile
.IP \[bu] 2
identical files names will have identical uploaded names
.IP \[bu] 2
can use shortcuts to shorten the directory recursion
.PP
Obfuscation
.PP
This is a simple "rotate" of the filename, with each file having a rot
distance based on the filename.
We store the distance at the beginning of the filename.
So a file called "hello" may become "53.jgnnq"
.PP
This is not a strong encryption of filenames, but it may stop automated
scanning tools from picking up on filename patterns.
As such it\[aq]s an intermediate between "off" and "standard".
The advantage is that it allows for longer path segment names.
.PP
There is a possibility with some unicode based filenames that the
obfuscation is weak and may map lower case characters to upper case
equivalents.
You can not rely on this for strong protection.
.IP \[bu] 2
file names very lightly obfuscated
.IP \[bu] 2
file names can be longer than standard encryption
.IP \[bu] 2
can use sub paths and copy single files
.IP \[bu] 2
directory structure visibile
.IP \[bu] 2
identical files names will have identical uploaded names
.PP
Cloud storage systems have various limits on file name length and total
path length which you are more likely to hit using "Standard" file name
encryption.
If you keep your file names to below 156 characters in length then you
should be OK on all providers.
.PP
There may be an even more secure file name encryption mode in the future
which will address the long file name problem.
.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
Crypt stores modification times using the underlying remote so support
depends on that.
.PP
Hashes are not stored for crypt.
However the data integrity is protected by an extremely strong crypto
authenticator.
.PP
Note that you should use the \f[C]rclone\ cryptcheck\f[] command to
check the integrity of a crypted remote instead of
\f[C]rclone\ check\f[] which can\[aq]t check the checksums properly.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-crypt\-show\-mapping
.PP
If this flag is set then for each file that the remote is asked to list,
it will log (at level INFO) a line stating the decrypted file name and
the encrypted file name.
.PP
This is so you can work out which encrypted names are which decrypted
names just in case you need to do something with the encrypted file
names, or for debugging purposes.
.SS Backing up a crypted remote
.PP
If you wish to backup a crypted remote, it it recommended that you use
\f[C]rclone\ sync\f[] on the encrypted files, and make sure the
passwords are the same in the new encrypted remote.
.PP
This will have the following advantages
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]rclone\ sync\f[] will check the checksums while copying
.IP \[bu] 2
you can use \f[C]rclone\ check\f[] between the encrypted remotes
.IP \[bu] 2
you don\[aq]t decrypt and encrypt unecessarily
.PP
For example, let\[aq]s say you have your original remote at
\f[C]remote:\f[] with the encrypted version at \f[C]eremote:\f[] with
path \f[C]remote:crypt\f[].
You would then set up the new remote \f[C]remote2:\f[] and then the
encrypted version \f[C]eremote2:\f[] with path \f[C]remote2:crypt\f[]
using the same passwords as \f[C]eremote:\f[].
.PP
To sync the two remotes you would do
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ remote:crypt\ remote2:crypt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
And to check the integrity you would do
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ check\ remote:crypt\ remote2:crypt
\f[]
.fi

.PP
Files are encrypted 1:1 source file to destination object.
The file has a header and is divided into chunks.
.SS Header
.IP \[bu] 2
8 bytes magic string \f[C]RCLONE\\x00\\x00\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
24 bytes Nonce (IV)
.PP
The initial nonce is generated from the operating systems crypto strong
random number genrator.
The nonce is incremented for each chunk read making sure each nonce is
unique for each block written.
The chance of a nonce being re\-used is miniscule.
If you wrote an exabyte of data (10¹⁸ bytes) you would have a
probability of approximately 2×10⁻³² of re\-using a nonce.
.SS Chunk
.PP
Each chunk will contain 64kB of data, except for the last one which may
have less data.
The data chunk is in standard NACL secretbox format.
Secretbox uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate
messages.
.PP
Each chunk contains:
.IP \[bu] 2
16 Bytes of Poly1305 authenticator
.IP \[bu] 2
1 \- 65536 bytes XSalsa20 encrypted data
.PP
64k chunk size was chosen as the best performing chunk size (the
authenticator takes too much time below this and the performance drops
off due to cache effects above this).
Note that these chunks are buffered in memory so they can\[aq]t be too
big.
.PP
This uses a 32 byte (256 bit key) key derived from the user password.
.SS Examples
.PP
1 byte file will encrypt to
.IP \[bu] 2
32 bytes header
.IP \[bu] 2
17 bytes data chunk
.PP
49 bytes total
.PP
1MB (1048576 bytes) file will encrypt to
.IP \[bu] 2
32 bytes header
.IP \[bu] 2
16 chunks of 65568 bytes
.PP
1049120 bytes total (a 0.05% overhead).
This is the overhead for big files.
.SS Name encryption
.PP
File names are encrypted segment by segment \- the path is broken up
into \f[C]/\f[] separated strings and these are encrypted individually.
.PP
File segments are padded using using PKCS#7 to a multiple of 16 bytes
before encryption.
.PP
They are then encrypted with EME using AES with 256 bit key.
EME (ECB\-Mix\-ECB) is a wide\-block encryption mode presented in the
2003 paper "A Parallelizable Enciphering Mode" by Halevi and Rogaway.
.PP
This makes for determinstic encryption which is what we want \- the same
filename must encrypt to the same thing otherwise we can\[aq]t find it
on the cloud storage system.
.PP
This means that
.IP \[bu] 2
filenames with the same name will encrypt the same
.IP \[bu] 2
filenames which start the same won\[aq]t have a common prefix
.PP
This uses a 32 byte key (256 bits) and a 16 byte (128 bits) IV both of
which are derived from the user password.
.PP
After encryption they are written out using a modified version of
standard \f[C]base32\f[] encoding as described in RFC4648.
The standard encoding is modified in two ways:
.IP \[bu] 2
it becomes lower case (no\-one likes upper case filenames!)
.IP \[bu] 2
we strip the padding character \f[C]=\f[]
.PP
\f[C]base32\f[] is used rather than the more efficient \f[C]base64\f[]
so rclone can be used on case insensitive remotes (eg Windows, Amazon
Drive).
.SS Key derivation
.PP
Rclone uses \f[C]scrypt\f[] with parameters \f[C]N=16384,\ r=8,\ p=1\f[]
with a an optional user supplied salt (password2) to derive the 32+32+16
= 80 bytes of key material required.
If the user doesn\[aq]t supply a salt then rclone uses an internal one.
.PP
\f[C]scrypt\f[] makes it impractical to mount a dictionary attack on
rclone encrypted data.
For full protection agains this you should always use a salt.
.SS Dropbox
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[]
.PP
Dropbox paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[].
.PP
The initial setup for dropbox involves getting a token from Dropbox
which you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone\ config\f[] walks you through it.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[].
First run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

.SS Modified time and Hashes
.PP
Dropbox supports modified times, but the only way to set a modification
time is to re\-upload the file.
.PP
This means that if you uploaded your data with an older version of
rclone which didn\[aq]t support the v2 API and modified times, rclone
will decide to upload all your old data to fix the modification times.
If you don\[aq]t want this to happen use \f[C]\-\-size\-only\f[] or
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag to stop it.
.PP
Dropbox supports its own hash
type (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/content-hash) which
is checked for all transfers.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-dropbox\-chunk\-size=SIZE
.PP
Upload chunk size.
Max 150M.
The default is 128MB.
Note that this isn\[aq]t buffered into memory.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Dropbox is case insensitive so you can\[aq]t have a file
called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".
.PP
There are some file names such as \f[C]thumbs.db\f[] which Dropbox
can\[aq]t store.
There is a full list of them in the "Ignored Files" section of this
document (https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/145).
Rclone will issue an error message
\f[C]File\ name\ disallowed\ \-\ not\ uploading\f[] if it attempt to
upload one of those file names, but the sync won\[aq]t fail.
.PP
If you have more than 10,000 files in a directory then
\f[C]rclone\ purge\ dropbox:dir\f[] will return the error
\f[C]Failed\ to\ purge:\ There\ are\ too\ many\ files\ involved\ in\ this\ operation\f[].
As a work\-around do an \f[C]rclone\ delete\ dropbox:dir\f[] followed by
an \f[C]rclone\ rmdir\ dropbox:dir\f[].
.SS FTP
.PP
FTP is the File Transfer Protocol.
FTP support is provided using the
github.com/jlaffaye/ftp (https://godoc.org/github.com/jlaffaye/ftp)
package.
.PP
Here is an example of making an FTP configuration.
First run
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ config
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This will guide you through an interactive setup process.
An FTP remote only needs a host together with and a username and a
password.
With anonymous FTP server, you will need to use \f[C]anonymous\f[] as
username and your email address as the password.

.SS Modified time
.PP
FTP does not support modified times.
Any times you see on the server will be time of upload.
.SS Checksums
.PP
FTP does not support any checksums.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that since FTP isn\[aq]t HTTP based the following flags don\[aq]t
work with it: \f[C]\-\-dump\-headers\f[], \f[C]\-\-dump\-bodies\f[],
\f[C]\-\-dump\-auth\f[]
.PP
Note that \f[C]\-\-timeout\f[] isn\[aq]t supported (but
\f[C]\-\-contimeout\f[] is).
.PP
Note that \f[C]\-\-bind\f[] isn\[aq]t supported.
.PP
FTP could support server side move but doesn\[aq]t yet.
.SS Google Cloud Storage
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:bucket\f[] (or \f[C]remote:\f[] for
the \f[C]lsd\f[] command.) You may put subdirectories in too, eg
\f[C]remote:bucket/path/to/dir\f[].

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall, or use
manual mode.

.SS Service Account support
.PP
You can set up rclone with Google Cloud Storage in an unattended mode,
i.e.
not tied to a specific end\-user Google account.
This is useful when you want to synchronise files onto machines that
don\[aq]t have actively logged\-in users, for example build machines.
.PP
To get credentials for Google Cloud Platform IAM Service
Accounts (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts), please
head to the Service
Account (https://console.cloud.google.com/permissions/serviceaccounts)
section of the Google Developer Console.
Service Accounts behave just like normal \f[C]User\f[] permissions in
Google Cloud Storage
ACLs (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control), so you can
limit their access (e.g.
make them read only).
After creating an account, a JSON file containing the Service
Account\[aq]s credentials will be downloaded onto your machines.
These credentials are what rclone will use for authentication.
.PP
To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path to
your Service Account credentials at the \f[C]service_account_file\f[]
prompt and rclone won\[aq]t use the browser based authentication flow.
.SS \-\-fast\-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] which allows you to use
fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (/docs/#fast-list) for more details.
.SS Modified time
.PP
Google google cloud storage stores md5sums natively and rclone stores
modification times as metadata on the object, under the "mtime" key in
RFC3339 format accurate to 1ns.
.SS Google Drive
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]drive:path\f[]
.PP
Drive paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]drive:directory/subdirectory\f[].

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall, or use

.SS Modified time
.PP
Google drive stores modification times accurate to 1 ms.
.SS Revisions
.PP
Google drive stores revisions of files.
When you upload a change to an existing file to google drive using
rclone it will create a new revision of that file.
.PP
Revisions follow the standard google policy which at time of writing was
.IP \[bu] 2
They are deleted after 30 days or 100 revisions (whatever comes first).
.IP \[bu] 2
They do not count towards a user storage quota.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
By default rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files.
If deleting them permanently is required then use the
\f[C]\-\-drive\-use\-trash=false\f[] flag, or set the equivalent
environment variable.
.SS Emptying trash
.PP
If you wish to empty your trash you can use the
\f[C]rclone\ cleanup\ remote:\f[] command which will permanently delete
all your trashed files.
This command does not take any path arguments.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-drive\-auth\-owner\-only
.PP
Only consider files owned by the authenticated user.
.SS \-\-drive\-chunk\-size=SIZE
.PP
Upload chunk size.
Must a power of 2 >= 256k.
Default value is 8 MB.
.PP
Making this larger will improve performance, but note that each chunk is
buffered in memory one per transfer.
.PP
Reducing this will reduce memory usage but decrease performance.
.SS \-\-drive\-formats
.PP
Google documents can only be exported from Google drive.
When rclone downloads a Google doc it chooses a format to download
depending upon this setting.
.PP
By default the formats are \f[C]docx,xlsx,pptx,svg\f[] which are a
sensible default for an editable document.
.PP
When choosing a format, rclone runs down the list provided in order and
chooses the first file format the doc can be exported as from the list.
If the file can\[aq]t be exported to a format on the formats list, then
rclone will choose a format from the default list.
.PP
If you prefer an archive copy then you might use
\f[C]\-\-drive\-formats\ pdf\f[], or if you prefer
openoffice/libreoffice formats you might use
\f[C]\-\-drive\-formats\ ods,odt,odp\f[].
.PP
Note that rclone adds the extension to the google doc, so if it is
calles \f[C]My\ Spreadsheet\f[] on google docs, it will be exported as
\f[C]My\ Spreadsheet.xlsx\f[] or \f[C]My\ Spreadsheet.pdf\f[] etc.

.SS \-\-drive\-list\-chunk int
.PP
Size of listing chunk 100\-1000.
0 to disable.
(default 1000)
.SS \-\-drive\-shared\-with\-me
.PP
Only show files that are shared with me
.SS \-\-drive\-skip\-gdocs
.PP
Skip google documents in all listings.
If given, gdocs practically become invisible to rclone.
.SS \-\-drive\-trashed\-only
.PP
Only show files that are in the trash.
This will show trashed files in their original directory structure.
.SS \-\-drive\-upload\-cutoff=SIZE
.PP
File size cutoff for switching to chunked upload.
Default is 8 MB.
.SS \-\-drive\-use\-trash
.PP
Controls whether files are sent to the trash or deleted permanently.
Defaults to true, namely sending files to the trash.
Use \f[C]\-\-drive\-use\-trash=false\f[] to delete files permanently
instead.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Drive has quite a lot of rate limiting.
This causes rclone to be limited to transferring about 2 files per
second only.
Individual files may be transferred much faster at 100s of MBytes/s but
lots of small files can take a long time.
.PP
Server side copies are also subject to a separate rate limit.
If you see User rate limit exceeded errors, wait at least 24 hours and
retry.
You can disable server side copies with \f[C]\-\-disable\ copy\f[] to
download and upload the files if you prefer.
.SS Duplicated files
.PP
Sometimes, for no reason I\[aq]ve been able to track down, drive will
duplicate a file that rclone uploads.
Drive unlike all the other remotes can have duplicated files.
.PP
Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.
.PP
Use \f[C]rclone\ dedupe\f[] to fix duplicated files.
.PP
Note that this isn\[aq]t just a problem with rclone, even Google Photos
on Android duplicates files on drive sometimes.
.SS Rclone appears to be re\-copying files it shouldn\[aq]t
.PP
There are two possible reasons for rclone to recopy files which
haven\[aq]t changed to Google Drive.
.PP
The first is the duplicated file issue above \- run
\f[C]rclone\ dedupe\f[] and check your logs for duplicate object or
directory messages.
.PP
The second is that sometimes Google reports different sizes for the
Google Docs exports which will cause rclone to re\-download Google Docs
for no apparent reason.
\f[C]\-\-ignore\-size\f[] is a not very satisfactory work\-around for
this if it is causing you a lot of problems.
.SS Google docs downloads sometimes fail with "Failed to copy: read X
bytes expecting Y"
.PP
This is the same problem as above.
Google reports the google doc is one size, but rclone downloads a
different size.
Work\-around with the \f[C]\-\-ignore\-size\f[] flag or wait for rclone
to retry the download which it will.
.SS Making your own client_id
.PP
When you use rclone with Google drive in its default configuration you
are using rclone\[aq]s client_id.
This is shared between all the rclone users.
There is a global rate limit on the number of queries per second that
each client_id can do set by Google.
rclone already has a high quota and I will continue to make sure it is
high enough by contacting Google.
.PP
However you might find you get better performance making your own
client_id if you are a heavy user.
Or you may not depending on exactly how Google have been raising
rclone\[aq]s rate limit.
.PP
Here is how to create your own Google Drive client ID for rclone:
.IP "1." 3
Log into the Google API Console (https://console.developers.google.com/)
with your Google account.
It doesn\[aq]t matter what Google account you use.
(It need not be the same account as the Google Drive you want to access)
.IP "2." 3
Select a project or create a new project.
.IP "3." 3
Under Overview, Google APIs, Google Apps APIs, click "Drive API", then
"Enable".
.IP "4." 3
Click "Credentials" in the left\-side panel (not "Go to credentials",
which opens the wizard), then "Create credentials", then "OAuth client
ID".
It will prompt you to set the OAuth consent screen product name, if you
haven\[aq]t set one already.
.IP "5." 3
Choose an application type of "other", and click "Create".
(the default name is fine)
.IP "6." 3
It will show you a client ID and client secret.
Use these values in rclone config to add a new remote or edit an
existing remote.
.PP
(Thanks to \@balazer on github for these instructions.)
.SS HTTP
.PP
The HTTP remote is a read only remote for reading files of a webserver.
The webserver should provide file listings which rclone will read and
turn into a remote.
This has been tested with common webservers such as Apache/Nginx/Caddy
and will likely work with file listings from most web servers.
(If it doesn\[aq]t then please file an issue, or send a pull request!)

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the

.SS \-\-fast\-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] which allows you to use
fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (/docs/#fast-list) for more details.
.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X\-Object\-Meta\-Mtime\f[] as floating point since the epoch
accurate to 1 ns.
.PP
This is a defacto standard (used in the official python\-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.
.PP
Note that Hubic wraps the Swift backend, so most of the properties of
are the same.
.SS Limitations
.PP
This uses the normal OpenStack Swift mechanism to refresh the Swift API
credentials and ignores the expires field returned by the Hubic API.
.PP
The Swift API doesn\[aq]t return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won\[aq]t check or use the
MD5SUM for these.
.SS Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:container\f[] (or \f[C]remote:\f[]

.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object with the

MD5 hashes are stored with blobs.
However blobs that were uploaded in chunks only have an MD5 if the

.SS Multipart uploads
.PP
Rclone supports multipart uploads with Azure Blob storage.
Files bigger than 256MB will be uploaded using chunked upload by
default.
.PP
The files will be uploaded in parallel in 4MB chunks (by default).
Note that these chunks are buffered in memory and there may be up to
\f[C]\-\-transfers\f[] of them being uploaded at once.
.PP
Files can\[aq]t be split into more than 50,000 chunks so by default, so
the largest file that can be uploaded with 4MB chunk size is 195GB.
Above this rclone will double the chunk size until it creates less than
50,000 chunks.
By default this will mean a maximum file size of 3.2TB can be uploaded.
This can be raised to 5TB using
\f[C]\-\-azureblob\-chunk\-size\ 100M\f[].
.PP
Note that rclone doesn\[aq]t commit the block list until the end of the
upload which means that there is a limit of 9.5TB of multipart uploads
in progress as Azure won\[aq]t allow more than that amount of
uncommitted blocks.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-azureblob\-upload\-cutoff=SIZE
.PP
Cutoff for switching to chunked upload \- must be <= 256MB.
The default is 256MB.
.SS \-\-azureblob\-chunk\-size=SIZE
.PP
Upload chunk size.
Default 4MB.
Note that this is stored in memory and there may be up to
\f[C]\-\-transfers\f[] chunks stored at once in memory.
This can be at most 100MB.
.SS Limitations
.PP
MD5 sums are only uploaded with chunked files if the source has an MD5
sum.
This will always be the case for a local to azure copy.
.SS Microsoft OneDrive
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[].
.PP
The initial setup for OneDrive involves getting a token from Microsoft
which you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone\ config\f[] walks you through it.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[].
First run:

.fi
.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Microsoft.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[] like this,
.PP
List directories in top level of your OneDrive
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ lsd\ remote:

\f[]
.fi
.PP
After that rclone requires an authentication of your account.
The application will first authenticate your account, then query the
OneDrive resource URL and do a second (silent) authentication for this
resource URL.
.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
OneDrive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
.PP
One drive supports SHA1 type hashes, so you can use
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.
Microsoft doesn\[aq]t provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to
empty the trash, so you will have to do that with one of Microsoft\[aq]s
apps or via the OneDrive website.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-onedrive\-chunk\-size=SIZE
.PP
Above this size files will be chunked \- must be multiple of 320k.
The default is 10MB.
Note that the chunks will be buffered into memory.
.SS \-\-onedrive\-upload\-cutoff=SIZE
.PP
Cutoff for switching to chunked upload \- must be <= 100MB.
The default is 10MB.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that OneDrive is case insensitive so you can\[aq]t have a file
called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".
.PP
There are quite a few characters that can\[aq]t be in OneDrive file
names.
These can\[aq]t occur on Windows platforms, but on non\-Windows
platforms they are common.
Rclone will map these names to and from an identical looking unicode
equivalent.
For example if a file has a \f[C]?\f[] in it will be mapped to
\f[C]？\f[] instead.
.PP
The largest allowed file size is 10GiB (10,737,418,240 bytes).
.SS QingStor
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:bucket\f[] (or \f[C]remote:\f[] for
the \f[C]lsd\f[] command.) You may put subdirectories in too, eg
\f[C]remote:bucket/path/to/dir\f[].
.PP
Here is an example of making an QingStor configuration.

.SS Multipart uploads
.PP
rclone supports multipart uploads with QingStor which means that it can
upload files bigger than 5GB.
Note that files uploaded with multipart upload don\[aq]t have an MD5SUM.
.SS Buckets and Zone
.PP
With QingStor you can list buckets (\f[C]rclone\ lsd\f[]) using any
zone, but you can only access the content of a bucket from the zone it
was created in.
If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong zone, you will get an
error,
\f[C]incorrect\ zone,\ the\ bucket\ is\ not\ in\ \[aq]XXX\[aq]\ zone\f[].
.SS Authentication
.PP
There are two ways to supply \f[C]rclone\f[] with a set of QingStor
credentials.

.SS Configuration from an Openstack credentials file
.PP
An Opentstack credentials file typically looks something something like
this (without the comments)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export\ OS_AUTH_URL=https://a.provider.net/v2.0
export\ OS_TENANT_ID=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
export\ OS_TENANT_NAME="1234567890123456"
export\ OS_USERNAME="123abc567xy"
echo\ "Please\ enter\ your\ OpenStack\ Password:\ "

export\ OS_REGION_NAME="SBG1"
if\ [\ \-z\ "$OS_REGION_NAME"\ ];\ then\ unset\ OS_REGION_NAME;\ fi
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The config file needs to look something like this where
\f[C]$OS_USERNAME\f[] represents the value of the \f[C]OS_USERNAME\f[]
variable \- \f[C]123abc567xy\f[] in the example above.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[remote]
type\ =\ swift
user\ =\ $OS_USERNAME
key\ =\ $OS_PASSWORD
auth\ =\ $OS_AUTH_URL
tenant\ =\ $OS_TENANT_NAME
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that you may (or may not) need to set \f[C]region\f[] too \- try
without first.
.SS Configuration from the environment
.PP
If you prefer you can configure rclone to use swift using a standard set
of OpenStack environment variables.
.PP
When you run through the config, make sure you choose \f[C]true\f[] for
\f[C]env_auth\f[] and leave everything else blank.
.PP
rclone will then set any empty config parameters from the enviroment
using standard OpenStack environment variables.
There is a list of the
variables (https://godoc.org/github.com/ncw/swift#Connection.ApplyEnvironment)
in the docs for the swift library.
.SS Using rclone without a config file
.PP
You can use rclone with swift without a config file, if desired, like
this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
source\ openstack\-credentials\-file
export\ RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_TYPE=swift
export\ RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_ENV_AUTH=true
rclone\ lsd\ myremote:
\f[]
.fi
.SS \-\-fast\-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] which allows you to use
fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (/docs/#fast-list) for more details.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-swift\-chunk\-size=SIZE
.PP
Above this size files will be chunked into a _segments container.
The default for this is 5GB which is its maximum value.
.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X\-Object\-Meta\-Mtime\f[] as floating point since the epoch
accurate to 1 ns.
.PP
This is a defacto standard (used in the official python\-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.
.SS Limitations
.PP
The Swift API doesn\[aq]t return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won\[aq]t check or use the
MD5SUM for these.
.SS Troubleshooting
.SS Rclone gives Failed to create file system for "remote:": Bad Request
.PP
Due to an oddity of the underlying swift library, it gives a "Bad
Request" error rather than a more sensible error when the authentication
fails for Swift.
.PP
So this most likely means your username / password is wrong.
You can investigate further with the \f[C]\-\-dump\-bodies\f[] flag.
.PP
This may also be caused by specifying the region when you shouldn\[aq]t
have (eg OVH).
.SS Rclone gives Failed to create file system: Response didn\[aq]t have
storage storage url and auth token
.PP
This is most likely caused by forgetting to specify your tenant when
setting up a swift remote.
.SS SFTP
.PP
SFTP is the Secure (or SSH) File Transfer
Protocol (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol).
.PP
It runs over SSH v2 and is standard with most modern SSH installations.
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[].
If the path does not begin with a \f[C]/\f[] it is relative to the home
directory of the user.
An empty path \f[C]remote:\f[] refers to the users home directory.
.PP
Here is an example of making a SFTP configuration.

This remote is called \f[C]remote\f[] and can now be used like this
.PP
See all directories in the home directory
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ lsd\ remote:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Make a new directory
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ mkdir\ remote:path/to/directory
\f[]
.fi
.PP
List the contents of a directory
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ ls\ remote:path/to/directory
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Sync \f[C]/home/local/directory\f[] to the remote directory, deleting
any excess files in the directory.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ /home/local/directory\ remote:directory
\f[]

.SS SSH Authentication
.PP
The SFTP remote supports 3 authentication methods
.IP \[bu] 2
Password
.IP \[bu] 2
Key file
.IP \[bu] 2
ssh\-agent
.PP
Key files should be unencrypted PEM\-encoded private key files.
For instance \f[C]/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa\f[].
.PP
If you don\[aq]t specify \f[C]pass\f[] or \f[C]key_file\f[] then it will
attempt to contact an ssh\-agent.
.SS ssh\-agent on macOS
.PP
Note that there seem to be various problems with using an ssh\-agent on
macOS due to recent changes in the OS.
The most effective work\-around seems to be to start an ssh\-agent in
each session, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
eval\ `ssh\-agent\ \-s`\ &&\ ssh\-add\ \-A
\f[]
.fi
.PP
And then at the end of the session
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
eval\ `ssh\-agent\ \-k`
\f[]
.fi
.PP
These commands can be used in scripts of course.
.SS Modified time
.PP
Modified times are stored on the server to 1 second precision.
.PP
Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported.
.SS Limitations
.PP
SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and
\f[C]md5sum\f[] or \f[C]sha1sum\f[] as well as \f[C]echo\f[] are in the
remote\[aq]s PATH.
.PP
The only ssh agent supported under Windows is Putty\[aq]s pagent.
.PP
SFTP isn\[aq]t supported under plan9 until this
issue (https://github.com/pkg/sftp/issues/156) is fixed.
.PP
Note that since SFTP isn\[aq]t HTTP based the following flags don\[aq]t
work with it: \f[C]\-\-dump\-headers\f[], \f[C]\-\-dump\-bodies\f[],
\f[C]\-\-dump\-auth\f[]
.PP
Note that \f[C]\-\-timeout\f[] isn\[aq]t supported (but
\f[C]\-\-contimeout\f[] is).
.SS Yandex Disk
.PP
Yandex Disk (https://disk.yandex.com) is a cloud storage solution
created by Yandex (https://yandex.com).
.PP
Yandex paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[].
.PP
Here is an example of making a yandex configuration.
First run
.IP

.fi
.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Yandex Disk.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[] like this,
.PP
See top level directories
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ lsd\ remote:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Make a new directory
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ mkdir\ remote:directory
\f[]
.fi
.PP
List the contents of a directory
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ ls\ remote:directory
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Sync \f[C]/home/local/directory\f[] to the remote path, deleting any
excess files in the path.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ /home/local/directory\ remote:directory
\f[]
.fi
.SS \-\-fast\-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] which allows you to use
fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (/docs/#fast-list) for more details.
.SS Modified time
.PP
Modified times are supported and are stored accurate to 1 ns in custom
metadata called \f[C]rclone_modified\f[] in RFC3339 with nanoseconds
format.
.SS MD5 checksums
.PP
MD5 checksums are natively supported by Yandex Disk.
.SS Emptying Trash
.PP
If you wish to empty your trash you can use the
\f[C]rclone\ cleanup\ remote:\f[] command which will permanently delete
all your trashed files.
This command does not take any path arguments.
.SS Local Filesystem
.PP
Local paths are specified as normal filesystem paths, eg
\f[C]/path/to/wherever\f[], so
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ /home/source\ /tmp/destination
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Will sync \f[C]/home/source\f[] to \f[C]/tmp/destination\f[]
.PP
These can be configured into the config file for consistencies sake, but
it is probably easier not to.
.SS Modified time
.PP
Rclone reads and writes the modified time using an accuracy determined
by the OS.
Typically this is 1ns on Linux, 10 ns on Windows and 1 Second on OS X.
.SS Filenames
.PP
Filenames are expected to be encoded in UTF\-8 on disk.
This is the normal case for Windows and OS X.
.PP
There is a bit more uncertainty in the Linux world, but new
distributions will have UTF\-8 encoded files names.
If you are using an old Linux filesystem with non UTF\-8 file names (eg
latin1) then you can use the \f[C]convmv\f[] tool to convert the
filesystem to UTF\-8.
This tool is available in most distributions\[aq] package managers.
.PP
If an invalid (non\-UTF8) filename is read, the invalid caracters will
be replaced with the unicode replacement character, \[aq]�\[aq].
\f[C]rclone\f[] will emit a debug message in this case (use \f[C]\-v\f[]
to see), eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Local\ file\ system\ at\ .:\ Replacing\ invalid\ UTF\-8\ characters\ in\ "gro\\xdf"
\f[]
.fi
.SS Long paths on Windows
.PP
Rclone handles long paths automatically, by converting all paths to long
UNC
paths (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx#maxpath)
which allows paths up to 32,767 characters.
.PP
This is why you will see that your paths, for instance
\f[C]c:\\files\f[] is converted to the UNC path
\f[C]\\\\?\\c:\\files\f[] in the output, and \f[C]\\\\server\\share\f[]
is converted to \f[C]\\\\?\\UNC\\server\\share\f[].
.PP
However, in rare cases this may cause problems with buggy file system
drivers like EncFS (https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/261).
To disable UNC conversion globally, add this to your
\f[C]\&.rclone.conf\f[] file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[local]
nounc\ =\ true
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you want to selectively disable UNC, you can add it to a separate
entry like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[nounc]
type\ =\ local
nounc\ =\ true
\f[]
.fi
.PP
And use rclone like this:
.PP
\f[C]rclone\ copy\ c:\\src\ nounc:z:\\dst\f[]
.PP
This will use UNC paths on \f[C]c:\\src\f[] but not on \f[C]z:\\dst\f[].
Of course this will cause problems if the absolute path length of a file
exceeds 258 characters on z, so only use this option if you have to.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to local storage
.SS \-\-copy\-links, \-L
.PP
Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).
.PP
If you supply this flag then rclone will follow the symlink and copy the
pointed to file or directory.
.PP
This flag applies to all commands.
.PP
For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ tree\ /tmp/a
/tmp/a
├──\ b\ \->\ ../b
├──\ expected\ \->\ ../expected
├──\ one
└──\ two
\ \ \ \ └──\ three
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then you can see the difference with and without the flag like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ ls\ /tmp/a
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 6\ one
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 6\ two/three
\f[]
.fi
.PP
and
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ \-L\ ls\ /tmp/a
\ \ \ \ \ 4174\ expected
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 6\ one
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 6\ two/three
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 6\ b/two
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 6\ b/one
\f[]
.fi
.SS \-\-local\-no\-unicode\-normalization
.PP
This flag is deprecated now.
Rclone no longer normalizes unicode file names, but it compares them
with unicode normalization in the sync routine instead.
.SS \-\-one\-file\-system, \-x
.PP
This tells rclone to stay in the filesystem specified by the root and
not to recurse into different file systems.
.PP
For example if you have a directory heirachy like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
root
├──\ disk1\ \ \ \ \ \-\ disk1\ mounted\ on\ the\ root
│\ \ \ └──\ file3\ \-\ stored\ on\ disk1
├──\ disk2\ \ \ \ \ \-\ disk2\ mounted\ on\ the\ root
│\ \ \ └──\ file4\ \-\ stored\ on\ disk12
├──\ file1\ \ \ \ \ \-\ stored\ on\ the\ root\ disk
└──\ file2\ \ \ \ \ \-\ stored\ on\ the\ root\ disk
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Using \f[C]rclone\ \-\-one\-file\-system\ copy\ root\ remote:\f[] will
only copy \f[C]file1\f[] and \f[C]file2\f[].
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ \-q\ \-\-one\-file\-system\ ls\ root
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\ file1
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\ file2
\f[]
.fi
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ \-q\ ls\ root
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\ disk1/file3
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\ disk2/file4
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\ file1
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\ file2
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[] Rclone (like most unix tools such as \f[C]du\f[],
\f[C]rsync\f[] and \f[C]tar\f[]) treats a bind mount to the same device
as being on the same filesystem.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[] This flag is only available on Unix based systems.
On systems where it isn\[aq]t supported (eg Windows) it will not appear
as an valid flag.
.SS \-\-skip\-links
.PP
This flag disables warning messages on skipped symlinks or junction
points, as you explicitly acknowledge that they should be skipped.

.SS Bugs and Limitations
.SS Empty directories are left behind / not created
.PP
With remotes that have a concept of directory, eg Local and Drive, empty
directories may be left behind, or not created when one was expected.
.PP
This is because rclone doesn\[aq]t have a concept of a directory \- it
only works on objects.
Most of the object storage systems can\[aq]t actually store a directory
so there is nowhere for rclone to store anything about directories.
.PP
You can work round this to some extent with the\f[C]purge\f[] command
which will delete everything under the path, \f[B]inluding\f[] empty
directories.
.PP
This may be fixed at some point in Issue
#100 (https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/100)
.SS Directory timestamps aren\[aq]t preserved
.PP
For the same reason as the above, rclone doesn\[aq]t have a concept of a
directory \- it only works on objects, therefore it can\[aq]t preserve
the timestamps of directories.
.SS Frequently Asked Questions
.SS Do all cloud storage systems support all rclone commands
.PP
Yes they do.
All the rclone commands (eg \f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[] etc) will work
on all the remote storage systems.
.SS Can I copy the config from one machine to another
.PP
Sure! Rclone stores all of its config in a single file.
If you want to find this file, the simplest way is to run
\f[C]rclone\ \-h\f[] and look at the help for the \f[C]\-\-config\f[]
flag which will tell you where it is.
.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for more
info.
.SS How do I configure rclone on a remote / headless box with no
browser?
.PP
This has now been documented in its own remote setup
page (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/).
.SS Can rclone sync directly from drive to s3
.PP
Rclone can sync between two remote cloud storage systems just fine.
.PP
Note that it effectively downloads the file and uploads it again, so the
node running rclone would need to have lots of bandwidth.
.PP
The syncs would be incremental (on a file by file basis).
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ drive:Folder\ s3:bucket
\f[]
.fi
.SS Using rclone from multiple locations at the same time
.PP
You can use rclone from multiple places at the same time if you choose
different subdirectory for the output, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Server\ A>\ rclone\ sync\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:ServerA
Server\ B>\ rclone\ sync\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:ServerB
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you sync to the same directory then you should use rclone copy
otherwise the two rclones may delete each others files, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Server\ A>\ rclone\ copy\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:Backup
Server\ B>\ rclone\ copy\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:Backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The file names you upload from Server A and Server B should be different
in this case, otherwise some file systems (eg Drive) may make
duplicates.
.SS Why doesn\[aq]t rclone support partial transfers / binary diffs like
rsync?
.PP
Rclone stores each file you transfer as a native object on the remote
cloud storage system.
This means that you can see the files you upload as expected using
alternative access methods (eg using the Google Drive web interface).
There is a 1:1 mapping between files on your hard disk and objects
created in the cloud storage system.
.PP
Cloud storage systems (at least none I\[aq]ve come across yet) don\[aq]t
support partially uploading an object.
You can\[aq]t take an existing object, and change some bytes in the
middle of it.
.PP
It would be possible to make a sync system which stored binary diffs
instead of whole objects like rclone does, but that would break the 1:1
mapping of files on your hard disk to objects in the remote cloud
storage system.
.PP
All the cloud storage systems support partial downloads of content, so
it would be possible to make partial downloads work.
However to make this work efficiently this would require storing a
significant amount of metadata, which breaks the desired 1:1 mapping of
files to objects.
.SS Can rclone do bi\-directional sync?
.PP
No, not at present.
rclone only does uni\-directional sync from A \-> B.
It may do in the future though since it has all the primitives \- it
just requires writing the algorithm to do it.
.SS Can I use rclone with an HTTP proxy?
.PP
Yes.
rclone will use the environment variables \f[C]HTTP_PROXY\f[],
\f[C]HTTPS_PROXY\f[] and \f[C]NO_PROXY\f[], similar to cURL and other
programs.
.PP
\f[C]HTTPS_PROXY\f[] takes precedence over \f[C]HTTP_PROXY\f[] for https
requests.
.PP
The environment values may be either a complete URL or a "host[:port]",
in which case the "http" scheme is assumed.
.PP
The \f[C]NO_PROXY\f[] allows you to disable the proxy for specific
hosts.
Hosts must be comma separated, and can contain domains or parts.
For instance "foo.com" also matches "bar.foo.com".
.SS Rclone gives x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided
error
.PP
This means that \f[C]rclone\f[] can\[aq]t file the SSL root
certificates.
Likely you are running \f[C]rclone\f[] on a NAS with a cut\-down Linux
OS, or possibly on Solaris.
.PP
Rclone (via the Go runtime) tries to load the root certificates from
these places on Linux.

So doing something like this should fix the problem.
It also sets the time which is important for SSL to work properly.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
mkdir\ \-p\ /etc/ssl/certs/
curl\ \-o\ /etc/ssl/certs/ca\-certificates.crt\ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca\-bundle/master/ca\-bundle.crt
ntpclient\ \-s\ \-h\ pool.ntp.org
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that you may need to add the \f[C]\-\-insecure\f[] option to the
\f[C]curl\f[] command line if it doesn\[aq]t work without.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
curl\ \-\-insecure\ \-o\ /etc/ssl/certs/ca\-certificates.crt\ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca\-bundle/master/ca\-bundle.crt

.SS Rclone gives Failed to load config file: function not implemented
error
.PP
Likely this means that you are running rclone on Linux version not
supported by the go runtime, ie earlier than version 2.6.23.
.PP
See the system requirements section in the go install
docs (https://golang.org/doc/install) for full details.
.SS All my uploaded docx/xlsx/pptx files appear as archive/zip
.PP
This is caused by uploading these files from a Windows computer which
hasn\[aq]t got the Microsoft Office suite installed.
The easiest way to fix is to install the Word viewer and the Microsoft
Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 and later
versions\[aq] file formats
.SS tcp lookup some.domain.com no such host
.PP
This happens when rclone cannot resolve a domain.
Please check that your DNS setup is generally working, e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ both\ should\ print\ a\ long\ list\ of\ possible\ IP\ addresses
dig\ www.googleapis.com\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ #\ resolve\ using\ your\ default\ DNS
dig\ www.googleapis.com\ \@8.8.8.8\ #\ resolve\ with\ Google\[aq]s\ DNS\ server
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you are using \f[C]systemd\-resolved\f[] (default on Arch Linux),
ensure it is at version 233 or higher.
Previous releases contain a bug which causes not all domains to be
resolved properly.
