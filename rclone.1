.SS Install
.PP
Rclone is a Go program and comes as a single binary file.
.PP
Download (http://rclone.org/downloads/) the relevant binary.
.PP
Or alternatively if you have Go 1.5+ installed use
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
go\ get\ github.com/ncw/rclone
\f[]
.fi
.PP
and this will build the binary in \f[C]$GOPATH/bin\f[].
If you have built rclone before then you will want to update its
dependencies first with this
.IP

.SS Configure
.PP
First you\[aq]ll need to configure rclone.
As the object storage systems have quite complicated authentication
these are kept in a config file \f[C]\&.rclone.conf\f[] in your home
directory by default.
(You can use the \f[C]\-\-config\f[] option to choose a different config
file.)
.PP
The easiest way to make the config is to run rclone with the config
option:

.SS Usage
.PP
Rclone syncs a directory tree from one storage system to another.
.PP
Its syntax is like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Syntax:\ [options]\ subcommand\ <parameters>\ <parameters...>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Source and destination paths are specified by the name you gave the
storage system in the config file then the sub path, eg "drive:myfolder"
to look at "myfolder" in Google drive.
.PP
You can define as many storage paths as you like in the config file.
.SS Subcommands
.SS rclone copy source:path dest:path
.PP
Copy the source to the destination.
Doesn\[aq]t transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification
time or MD5SUM.
Doesn\[aq]t delete files from the destination.
.PP
Note that it is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not
the directory so when source:path is a directory, it\[aq]s the contents
of source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.
.PP
If dest:path doesn\[aq]t exist, it is created and the source:path
contents go there.
.PP
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ source:sourcepath\ dest:destpath
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Let\[aq]s say there are two files in sourcepath
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sourcepath/one.txt
sourcepath/two.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This copies them to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
destpath/one.txt
destpath/two.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Not to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
destpath/sourcepath/one.txt
destpath/sourcepath/two.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you are familiar with \f[C]rsync\f[], rclone always works as if you
had written a trailing / \- meaning "copy the contents of this
directory".
This applies to all commands and whether you are talking about the
source or destination.
.SS rclone sync source:path dest:path
.PP
Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only.
Doesn\[aq]t transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification
time or MD5SUM.
Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files if
necessary.
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[]: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
\f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] flag to see exactly what would be copied and
deleted.
.PP
Note that files in the destination won\[aq]t be deleted if there were
any errors at any point.
.PP
It is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not the
directory so when source:path is a directory, it\[aq]s the contents of
source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.
See extended explanation in the \f[C]copy\f[] command above if unsure.
.PP
If dest:path doesn\[aq]t exist, it is created and the source:path
contents go there.
.SS move source:path dest:path
.PP
Moves the source to the destination.
.PP
If there are no filters in use this is equivalent to a copy followed by
a purge, but may use server side operations to speed it up if possible.
.PP
If filters are in use then it is equivalent to a copy followed by
delete, followed by an rmdir (which only removes the directory if
empty).
The individual file moves will be moved with server side operations if
possible.
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[]: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
\-\-dry\-run flag.
.SS rclone ls remote:path
.PP
List all the objects in the path with size and path.
.SS rclone lsd remote:path
.PP
List all directories/containers/buckets in the the path.
.SS rclone lsl remote:path
.PP
List all the objects in the the path with modification time, size and
path.
.SS rclone md5sum remote:path
.PP
Produces an md5sum file for all the objects in the path.
This is in the same format as the standard md5sum tool produces.
.SS rclone sha1sum remote:path
.PP
Produces an sha1sum file for all the objects in the path.
This is in the same format as the standard sha1sum tool produces.
.SS rclone size remote:path
.PP
Prints the total size of objects in remote:path and the number of
objects.
.SS rclone mkdir remote:path
.PP
Make the path if it doesn\[aq]t already exist
.SS rclone rmdir remote:path
.PP
Remove the path.
Note that you can\[aq]t remove a path with objects in it, use purge for
that.
.SS rclone purge remote:path
.PP
Remove the path and all of its contents.
Note that this does not obey include/exclude filters \- everything will
be removed.
Use \f[C]delete\f[] if you want to selectively delete files.
.SS rclone delete remote:path
.PP
Remove the contents of path.
Unlike \f[C]purge\f[] it obeys include/exclude filters so can be used to
selectively delete files.
.PP
Eg delete all files bigger than 100MBytes
.PP
Check what would be deleted first (use either)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ \-\-min\-size\ 100M\ lsl\ remote:path
rclone\ \-\-dry\-run\ \-\-min\-size\ 100M\ delete\ remote:path
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then delete
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ \-\-min\-size\ 100M\ delete\ remote:path
\f[]
.fi
.PP
That reads "delete everything with a minimum size of 100 MB", hence
delete all files bigger than 100MBytes.
.SS rclone check source:path dest:path
.PP
Checks the files in the source and destination match.
It compares sizes and MD5SUMs and prints a report of files which
don\[aq]t match.
It doesn\[aq]t alter the source or destination.
.PP
\f[C]\-\-size\-only\f[] may be used to only compare the sizes, not the
MD5SUMs.
.SS rclone dedupe remote:path
.PP
By default \f[C]dedup\f[] interactively finds duplicate files and offers
to delete all but one or rename them to be different.
Only useful with Google Drive which can have duplicate file names.
.PP
The \f[C]dedupe\f[] command will delete all but one of any identical
(same md5sum) files it finds without confirmation.
This means that for most duplicated files the \f[C]dedupe\f[] command
will not be interactive.
You can use \f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] to see what would happen without doing
anything.
.PP
Here is an example run.

.SS rclone config
.PP
Enter an interactive configuration session.
.SS rclone help
.PP
Prints help on rclone commands and options.
.SS Quoting and the shell
.PP
When you are typing commands to your computer you are using something
called the command line shell.
This interprets various characters in an OS specific way.
.PP
Here are some gotchas which may help users unfamiliar with the shell
rules
.SS Linux / OSX
.PP
If your names have spaces or shell metacharacters (eg \f[C]*\f[],
\f[C]?\f[], \f[C]$\f[], \f[C]\[aq]\f[], \f[C]"\f[] etc) then you must
quote them.
Use single quotes \f[C]\[aq]\f[] by default.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ \[aq]Important\ files?\[aq]\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you want to send a \f[C]\[aq]\f[] you will need to use \f[C]"\f[], eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ "O\[aq]Reilly\ Reviews"\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The rules for quoting metacharacters are complicated and if you want the
full details you\[aq]ll have to consult the manual page for your shell.
.SS Windows
.PP
If your names have spaces in you need to put them in \f[C]"\f[], eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ "E:\\folder\ name\\folder\ name\\folder\ name"\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you are using the root directory on its own then don\[aq]t quote it
(see #464 (https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/464) for why), eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ E:\\\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.SS Server Side Copy
.PP
Drive, S3, Dropbox, Swift and Google Cloud Storage support server side
copy.
.PP
This means if you want to copy one folder to another then rclone
won\[aq]t download all the files and re\-upload them; it will instruct
the server to copy them in place.
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ s3:oldbucket\ s3:newbucket
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Will copy the contents of \f[C]oldbucket\f[] to \f[C]newbucket\f[]
without downloading and re\-uploading.
.PP
Remotes which don\[aq]t support server side copy (eg local)
\f[B]will\f[] download and re\-upload in this case.
.PP
Server side copies are used with \f[C]sync\f[] and \f[C]copy\f[] and
will be identified in the log when using the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag.
.PP
Server side copies will only be attempted if the remote names are the
same.
.PP
This can be used when scripting to make aged backups efficiently, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ remote:current\-backup\ remote:previous\-backup
rclone\ sync\ /path/to/files\ remote:current\-backup
\f[]
.fi
.SS Options
.PP
Rclone has a number of options to control its behaviour.
.PP
Options which use TIME use the go time parser.
A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each
with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "\-1.5h" or
"2h45m".
Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
.PP
Options which use SIZE use kByte by default.
However a suffix of \f[C]b\f[] for bytes, \f[C]k\f[] for kBytes,
\f[C]M\f[] for MBytes and \f[C]G\f[] for GBytes may be used.
These are the binary units, eg 1, 2**10, 2**20, 2**30 respectively.
.SS \-\-bwlimit=SIZE
.PP
Bandwidth limit in kBytes/s, or use suffix b|k|M|G.
The default is \f[C]0\f[] which means to not limit bandwidth.
.PP
For example to limit bandwidth usage to 10 MBytes/s use
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit\ 10M\f[]
.PP
This only limits the bandwidth of the data transfer, it doesn\[aq]t
limit the bandwith of the directory listings etc.
.SS \-\-checkers=N
.PP
The number of checkers to run in parallel.
Checkers do the equality checking of files during a sync.
For some storage systems (eg s3, swift, dropbox) this can take a
significant amount of time so they are run in parallel.
.PP
The default is to run 8 checkers in parallel.
.SS \-c, \-\-checksum
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check the file hash and size to
determine if files are equal.
.PP
This is useful when the remote doesn\[aq]t support setting modified time
and a more accurate sync is desired than just checking the file size.
.PP
This is very useful when transferring between remotes which store the
same hash type on the object, eg Drive and Swift.
For details of which remotes support which hash type see the table in
the overview section (http://rclone.org/overview/).
.PP
Eg \f[C]rclone\ \-\-checksum\ sync\ s3:/bucket\ swift:/bucket\f[] would
run much quicker than without the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.PP
When using this flag, rclone won\[aq]t update mtimes of remote files if
they are incorrect as it would normally.
.SS \-\-config=CONFIG_FILE
.PP
Specify the location of the rclone config file.
Normally this is in your home directory as a file called
\f[C]\&.rclone.conf\f[].
If you run \f[C]rclone\ \-h\f[] and look at the help for the
\f[C]\-\-config\f[] option you will see where the default location is
for you.
Use this flag to override the config location, eg
\f[C]rclone\ \-\-config=".myconfig"\ .config\f[].
.SS \-\-contimeout=TIME
.PP
Set the connection timeout.
This should be in go time format which looks like \f[C]5s\f[] for 5
seconds, \f[C]10m\f[] for 10 minutes, or \f[C]3h30m\f[].
.PP
The connection timeout is the amount of time rclone will wait for a
connection to go through to a remote object storage system.
It is \f[C]1m\f[] by default.
.SS \-\-dedupe\-mode MODE
.PP
Mode to run dedupe command in.
One of \f[C]interactive\f[], \f[C]skip\f[], \f[C]first\f[],
\f[C]newest\f[], \f[C]oldest\f[], \f[C]rename\f[].
The default is \f[C]interactive\f[].
See the dedupe command for more information as to what these options
mean.
.SS \-n, \-\-dry\-run
.PP
Do a trial run with no permanent changes.
Use this to see what rclone would do without actually doing it.
Useful when setting up the \f[C]sync\f[] command which deletes files in
the destination.
.SS \-\-ignore\-existing
.PP
Using this option will make rclone unconditionally skip all files that
exist on the destination, no matter the content of these files.
.PP
While this isn\[aq]t a generally recommended option, it can be useful in
cases where your files change due to encryption.
However, it cannot correct partial transfers in case a transfer was
interrupted.
.SS \-\-ignore\-size
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check only the modification time.
If \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] is set then it only checks the checksum.
.PP
It will also cause rclone to skip verifying the sizes are the same after
transfer.
.PP
This can be useful for transferring files to and from onedrive which
occasionally misreports the size of image files (see
#399 (https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/399) for more info).
.SS \-I, \-\-ignore\-times
.PP
Using this option will cause rclone to unconditionally upload all files
regardless of the state of files on the destination.
.PP
Normally rclone would skip any files that have the same modification
time and are the same size (or have the same checksum if using
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[]).
.SS \-\-log\-file=FILE
.PP
Log all of rclone\[aq]s output to FILE.
This is not active by default.
This can be useful for tracking down problems with syncs in combination
with the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag.
See the Logging section for more info.
.SS \-\-low\-level\-retries NUMBER
.PP
This controls the number of low level retries rclone does.
.PP
A low level retry is used to retry a failing operation \- typically one
HTTP request.
This might be uploading a chunk of a big file for example.
You will see low level retries in the log with the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag.
.PP
This shouldn\[aq]t need to be changed from the default in normal
operations, however if you get a lot of low level retries you may wish
to reduce the value so rclone moves on to a high level retry (see the
\f[C]\-\-retries\f[] flag) quicker.
.PP
Disable low level retries with \f[C]\-\-low\-level\-retries\ 1\f[].
.SS \-\-max\-depth=N
.PP
This modifies the recursion depth for all the commands except purge.
.PP
So if you do \f[C]rclone\ \-\-max\-depth\ 1\ ls\ remote:path\f[] you
will see only the files in the top level directory.
Using \f[C]\-\-max\-depth\ 2\f[] means you will see all the files in
first two directory levels and so on.
.PP
For historical reasons the \f[C]lsd\f[] command defaults to using a
\f[C]\-\-max\-depth\f[] of 1 \- you can override this with the command
line flag.
.PP
You can use this command to disable recursion (with
\f[C]\-\-max\-depth\ 1\f[]).
.PP
Note that if you use this with \f[C]sync\f[] and
\f[C]\-\-delete\-excluded\f[] the files not recursed through are
considered excluded and will be deleted on the destination.
Test first with \f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] if you are not sure what will
happen.
.SS \-\-modify\-window=TIME
.PP
When checking whether a file has been modified, this is the maximum
allowed time difference that a file can have and still be considered
equivalent.
.PP
The default is \f[C]1ns\f[] unless this is overridden by a remote.
For example OS X only stores modification times to the nearest second so
if you are reading and writing to an OS X filing system this will be
\f[C]1s\f[] by default.
.PP
This command line flag allows you to override that computed default.
.SS \-\-no\-gzip\-encoding
.PP
Don\[aq]t set \f[C]Accept\-Encoding:\ gzip\f[].
This means that rclone won\[aq]t ask the server for compressed files
automatically.
Useful if you\[aq]ve set the server to return files with
\f[C]Content\-Encoding:\ gzip\f[] but you uploaded compressed files.
.PP
There is no need to set this in normal operation, and doing so will
decrease the network transfer efficiency of rclone.
.SS \-q, \-\-quiet
.PP
Normally rclone outputs stats and a completion message.
If you set this flag it will make as little output as possible.
.SS \-\-retries int
.PP
Retry the entire sync if it fails this many times it fails (default 3).
.PP
Some remotes can be unreliable and a few retries helps pick up the files
which didn\[aq]t get transferred because of errors.
.PP
Disable retries with \f[C]\-\-retries\ 1\f[].
.SS \-\-size\-only
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check only the size.
.PP
This can be useful transferring files from dropbox which have been
modified by the desktop sync client which doesn\[aq]t set checksums of
modification times in the same way as rclone.
.SS \-\-stats=TIME
.PP
Rclone will print stats at regular intervals to show its progress.
.PP
This sets the interval.
.PP
The default is \f[C]1m\f[].
Use 0 to disable.
.SS \-\-delete\-(before,during,after)
.PP
This option allows you to specify when files on your destination are
deleted when you sync folders.
.PP
Specifying the value \f[C]\-\-delete\-before\f[] will delete all files
present on the destination, but not on the source \f[I]before\f[]
starting the transfer of any new or updated files.
.PP
Specifying \f[C]\-\-delete\-during\f[] (default value) will delete files
while checking and uploading files.
This is usually the fastest option.
.PP
Specifying \f[C]\-\-delete\-after\f[] will delay deletion of files until
all new/updated files have been successfully transfered.
.SS \-\-timeout=TIME
.PP
This sets the IO idle timeout.
If a transfer has started but then becomes idle for this long it is
considered broken and disconnected.
.PP
The default is \f[C]5m\f[].
Set to 0 to disable.
.SS \-\-transfers=N
.PP
The number of file transfers to run in parallel.
It can sometimes be useful to set this to a smaller number if the remote
is giving a lot of timeouts or bigger if you have lots of bandwidth and
a fast remote.
.PP
The default is to run 4 file transfers in parallel.
.SS \-u, \-\-update
.PP
This forces rclone to skip any files which exist on the destination and
have a modified time that is newer than the source file.
.PP
If an existing destination file has a modification time equal (within
the computed modify window precision) to the source file\[aq]s, it will
be updated if the sizes are different.
.PP
On remotes which don\[aq]t support mod time directly the time checked
will be the uploaded time.
This means that if uploading to one of these remoes, rclone will skip
any files which exist on the destination and have an uploaded time that
is newer than the modification time of the source file.
.PP
This can be useful when transferring to a remote which doesn\[aq]t
support mod times directly as it is more accurate than a
\f[C]\-\-size\-only\f[] check and faster than using
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[].
.SS \-v, \-\-verbose
.PP
If you set this flag, rclone will become very verbose telling you about
every file it considers and transfers.
.PP
Very useful for debugging.
.SS \-V, \-\-version
.PP
Prints the version number
.SS Configuration Encryption
.PP
Your configuration file contains information for logging in to your
cloud services.
This means that you should keep your \f[C]\&.rclone.conf\f[] file in a
secure location.
.PP
If you are in an environment where that isn\[aq]t possible, you can add
a password to your configuration.
This means that you will have to enter the password every time you start
rclone.
.PP
To add a password to your rclone configuration, execute
\f[C]rclone\ config\f[].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
>rclone\ config
Current\ remotes:

e)\ Edit\ existing\ remote
n)\ New\ remote
d)\ Delete\ remote
s)\ Set\ configuration\ password
q)\ Quit\ config
e/n/d/s/q>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Go into \f[C]s\f[], Set configuration password:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
e/n/d/s/q>\ s
Your\ configuration\ is\ not\ encrypted.
If\ you\ add\ a\ password,\ you\ will\ protect\ your\ login\ information\ to\ cloud\ services.
a)\ Add\ Password

Password\ set
Your\ configuration\ is\ encrypted.
c)\ Change\ Password
u)\ Unencrypt\ configuration
q)\ Quit\ to\ main\ menu
c/u/q>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Your configuration is now encrypted, and every time you start rclone you
will now be asked for the password.
In the same menu you can change the password or completely remove
encryption from your configuration.
.PP
There is no way to recover the configuration if you lose your password.
.PP
rclone uses nacl
secretbox (https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox) which
in turn uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate your
configuration with secret\-key cryptography.
The password is SHA\-256 hashed, which produces the key for secretbox.
The hashed password is not stored.
.PP
While this provides very good security, we do not recommend storing your
encrypted rclone configuration in public if it contains sensitive
information, maybe except if you use a very strong password.
.PP
If it is safe in your environment, you can set the
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[] environment variable to contain your
password, in which case it will be used for decrypting the
configuration.
.PP
If you are running rclone inside a script, you might want to disable
password prompts.
To do that, pass the parameter \f[C]\-\-ask\-password=false\f[] to
rclone.
This will make rclone fail instead of asking for a password if
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[] doesn\[aq]t contain a valid password.
.SS Developer options
.PP
These options are useful when developing or debugging rclone.
There are also some more remote specific options which aren\[aq]t
documented here which are used for testing.
These start with remote name eg \f[C]\-\-drive\-test\-option\f[] \- see
the docs for the remote in question.
.SS \-\-cpuprofile=FILE
.PP
Write CPU profile to file.
This can be analysed with \f[C]go\ tool\ pprof\f[].
.SS \-\-dump\-bodies
.PP
Dump HTTP headers and bodies \- may contain sensitive info.
Can be very verbose.
Useful for debugging only.
.SS \-\-dump\-filters
.PP
Dump the filters to the output.
Useful to see exactly what include and exclude options are filtering on.
.SS \-\-dump\-headers
.PP
Dump HTTP headers \- may contain sensitive info.
Can be very verbose.
Useful for debugging only.
.SS \-\-memprofile=FILE
.PP
Write memory profile to file.
This can be analysed with \f[C]go\ tool\ pprof\f[].
.SS \-\-no\-check\-certificate=true/false
.PP
\f[C]\-\-no\-check\-certificate\f[] controls whether a client verifies
the server\[aq]s certificate chain and host name.
If \f[C]\-\-no\-check\-certificate\f[] is true, TLS accepts any
certificate presented by the server and any host name in that
certificate.
In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man\-in\-the\-middle attacks.
.PP
This option defaults to \f[C]false\f[].
.PP
\f[B]This should be used only for testing.\f[]

.SS Logging
.PP
rclone has 3 levels of logging, \f[C]Error\f[], \f[C]Info\f[] and
\f[C]Debug\f[].
.PP
By default rclone logs \f[C]Error\f[] and \f[C]Info\f[] to standard
error and \f[C]Debug\f[] to standard output.
This means you can redirect standard output and standard error to
different places.
.PP
By default rclone will produce \f[C]Error\f[] and \f[C]Info\f[] level
messages.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-q\f[] flag, rclone will only produce
\f[C]Error\f[] messages.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag, rclone will produce \f[C]Error\f[],
\f[C]Info\f[] and \f[C]Debug\f[] messages.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-\-log\-file=FILE\f[] option, rclone will redirect
\f[C]Error\f[], \f[C]Info\f[] and \f[C]Debug\f[] messages along with
standard error to FILE.
.SS Exit Code
.PP
If any errors occurred during the command, rclone will set a non zero
exit code.
This allows scripts to detect when rclone operations have failed.
.SH Configuring rclone on a remote / headless machine
.PP
Some of the configurations (those involving oauth2) require an Internet
connected web browser.
.PP
If you are trying to set rclone up on a remote or headless box with no
browser available on it (eg a NAS or a server in a datacenter) then you
will need to use an alternative means of configuration.
There are two ways of doing it, described below.
.SS Configuring using rclone authorize
.PP
On the headless box
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

.PP
Then back to the headless box, paste in the code

y)\ Yes\ this\ is\ OK
e)\ Edit\ this\ remote
d)\ Delete\ this\ remote
y/e/d>
\f[]
.fi
.SS Configuring by copying the config file
.PP
Rclone stores all of its config in a single configuration file.
This can easily be copied to configure a remote rclone.
.PP
So first configure rclone on your desktop machine
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ config
\f[]
.fi
.PP
to set up the config file.
.PP
Find the config file by running \f[C]rclone\ \-h\f[] and looking for the
help for the \f[C]\-\-config\f[] option
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ \-h
[snip]
\ \ \ \ \ \ \-\-config="/home/user/.rclone.conf":\ Config\ file.
[snip]
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Now transfer it to the remote box (scp, cut paste, ftp, sftp etc) and
place it in the correct place (use \f[C]rclone\ \-h\f[] on the remote
box to find out where).
.SH Filtering, includes and excludes
.PP
Rclone has a sophisticated set of include and exclude rules.
Some of these are based on patterns and some on other things like file
size.
.PP
The filters are applied for the \f[C]copy\f[], \f[C]sync\f[],
\f[C]move\f[], \f[C]ls\f[], \f[C]lsl\f[], \f[C]md5sum\f[],
\f[C]sha1sum\f[], \f[C]size\f[], \f[C]delete\f[] and \f[C]check\f[]
operations.
Note that \f[C]purge\f[] does not obey the filters.
.PP
Each path as it passes through rclone is matched against the include and
exclude rules like \f[C]\-\-include\f[], \f[C]\-\-exclude\f[],
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[], \f[C]\-\-exclude\-from\f[],
\f[C]\-\-filter\f[], or \f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[].
The simplest way to try them out is using the \f[C]ls\f[] command, or
\f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] together with \f[C]\-v\f[].
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[] Due to limitations of the command line parser you can
only use any of these options once \- if you duplicate them then rclone
will use the last one only.
.SS Patterns
.PP
The patterns used to match files for inclusion or exclusion are based on
"file globs" as used by the unix shell.
.PP
If the pattern starts with a \f[C]/\f[] then it only matches at the top
level of the directory tree, relative to the root of the remote.
If it doesn\[aq]t start with \f[C]/\f[] then it is matched starting at
the \f[B]end of the path\f[], but it will only match a complete path
element:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
file.jpg\ \ \-\ matches\ "file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "directory/file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "afile.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "directory/afile.jpg"
/file.jpg\ \-\ matches\ "file.jpg"\ in\ the\ root\ directory\ of\ the\ remote
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "afile.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "directory/file.jpg"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[] Note that you must use \f[C]/\f[] in patterns and not
\f[C]\\\f[] even if running on Windows.
.PP
A \f[C]*\f[] matches anything but not a \f[C]/\f[].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*.jpg\ \ \-\ matches\ "file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "directory/file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "file.jpg/something"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Use \f[C]**\f[] to match anything, including slashes (\f[C]/\f[]).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
dir/**\ \-\ matches\ "dir/file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "dir/dir1/dir2/file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "directory/file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "adir/file.jpg"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
A \f[C]?\f[] matches any character except a slash \f[C]/\f[].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
l?ss\ \ \-\ matches\ "less"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "lass"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "floss"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
A \f[C][\f[] and \f[C]]\f[] together make a a character class, such as
\f[C][a\-z]\f[] or \f[C][aeiou]\f[] or \f[C][[:alpha:]]\f[].
See the go regexp docs (https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/) for more
info on these.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
h[ae]llo\ \-\ matches\ "hello"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "hallo"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "hullo"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
A \f[C]{\f[] and \f[C]}\f[] define a choice between elements.
It should contain a comma seperated list of patterns, any of which might
match.
These patterns can contain wildcards.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{one,two}_potato\ \-\ matches\ "one_potato"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "two_potato"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "three_potato"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "_potato"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Special characters can be escaped with a \f[C]\\\f[] before them.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\\*.jpg\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "*.jpg"
\\\\.jpg\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "\\.jpg"
\\[one\\].jpg\ \ \-\ matches\ "[one].jpg"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note also that rclone filter globs can only be used in one of the filter
command line flags, not in the specification of the remote, so
\f[C]rclone\ copy\ "remote:dir*.jpg"\ /path/to/dir\f[] won\[aq]t work \-
what is required is
\f[C]rclone\ \-\-include\ "*.jpg"\ copy\ remote:dir\ /path/to/dir\f[]
.SS Directories
.PP
Rclone keeps track of directories that could match any file patterns.
.PP
Eg if you add the include rule
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\\a\\*.jpg
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Rclone will synthesize the directory include rule
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\\a\\
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you put any rules which end in \f[C]\\\f[] then it will only match
directories.
.PP
Directory matches are \f[B]only\f[] used to optimise directory access
patterns \- you must still match the files that you want to match.
Directory matches won\[aq]t optimise anything on bucket based remotes
(eg s3, swift, google compute storage, b2) which don\[aq]t have a
concept of directory.
.SS Differences between rsync and rclone patterns
.PP
Rclone implements bash style \f[C]{a,b,c}\f[] glob matching which rsync
doesn\[aq]t.
.PP
Rclone always does a wildcard match so \f[C]\\\f[] must always escape a
\f[C]\\\f[].
.SS How the rules are used
.PP
Rclone maintains a list of include rules and exclude rules.
.PP
Each file is matched in order against the list until it finds a match.
The file is then included or excluded according to the rule type.
.PP
If the matcher falls off the bottom of the list then the path is
included.
.PP
For example given the following rules, \f[C]+\f[] being include,
\f[C]\-\f[] being exclude,
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\ secret*.jpg
+\ *.jpg
+\ *.png
+\ file2.avi
\-\ *
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This would include
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]file1.jpg\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]file3.png\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]file2.avi\f[]
.PP
This would exclude
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]secret17.jpg\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
non \f[C]*.jpg\f[] and \f[C]*.png\f[]
.PP
A similar process is done on directory entries before recursing into
them.
This only works on remotes which have a concept of directory (Eg local,
drive, onedrive, amazon cloud drive) and not on bucket based remotes (eg
s3, swift, google compute storage, b2).
.SS Adding filtering rules
.PP
Filtering rules are added with the following command line flags.
.SS \f[C]\-\-exclude\f[] \- Exclude files matching pattern
.PP
Add a single exclude rule with \f[C]\-\-exclude\f[].
.PP
Eg \f[C]\-\-exclude\ *.bak\f[] to exclude all bak files from the sync.
.SS \f[C]\-\-exclude\-from\f[] \- Read exclude patterns from file
.PP
Add exclude rules from a file.
.PP
Prepare a file like this \f[C]exclude\-file.txt\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ a\ sample\ exclude\ rule\ file
*.bak
file2.jpg
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then use as \f[C]\-\-exclude\-from\ exclude\-file.txt\f[].
This will sync all files except those ending in \f[C]bak\f[] and
\f[C]file2.jpg\f[].
.PP
This is useful if you have a lot of rules.
.SS \f[C]\-\-include\f[] \- Include files matching pattern
.PP
Add a single include rule with \f[C]\-\-include\f[].
.PP
Eg \f[C]\-\-include\ *.{png,jpg}\f[] to include all \f[C]png\f[] and
\f[C]jpg\f[] files in the backup and no others.
.PP
This adds an implicit \f[C]\-\-exclude\ *\f[] at the very end of the
filter list.
This means you can mix \f[C]\-\-include\f[] and
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[] with the other filters (eg
\f[C]\-\-exclude\f[]) but you must include all the files you want in the
include statement.
If this doesn\[aq]t provide enough flexibility then you must use
\f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[].
.SS \f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[] \- Read include patterns from file
.PP
Add include rules from a file.
.PP
Prepare a file like this \f[C]include\-file.txt\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ a\ sample\ include\ rule\ file
*.jpg
*.png
file2.avi
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then use as \f[C]\-\-include\-from\ include\-file.txt\f[].
This will sync all \f[C]jpg\f[], \f[C]png\f[] files and
\f[C]file2.avi\f[].
.PP
This is useful if you have a lot of rules.
.PP
This adds an implicit \f[C]\-\-exclude\ *\f[] at the very end of the
filter list.
This means you can mix \f[C]\-\-include\f[] and
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[] with the other filters (eg
\f[C]\-\-exclude\f[]) but you must include all the files you want in the
include statement.
If this doesn\[aq]t provide enough flexibility then you must use
\f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[].
.SS \f[C]\-\-filter\f[] \- Add a file\-filtering rule
.PP
This can be used to add a single include or exclude rule.
Include rules start with \f[C]+\f[] and exclude rules start with
\f[C]\-\f[].
A special rule called \f[C]!\f[] can be used to clear the existing
rules.
.PP
Eg \f[C]\-\-filter\ "\-\ *.bak"\f[] to exclude all bak files from the
sync.
.SS \f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[] \- Read filtering patterns from a file
.PP
Add include/exclude rules from a file.
.PP
Prepare a file like this \f[C]filter\-file.txt\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ a\ sample\ exclude\ rule\ file
\-\ secret*.jpg
+\ *.jpg
+\ *.png
+\ file2.avi
#\ exclude\ everything\ else
\-\ *
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then use as \f[C]\-\-filter\-from\ filter\-file.txt\f[].
The rules are processed in the order that they are defined.
.PP
This example will include all \f[C]jpg\f[] and \f[C]png\f[] files,
exclude any files matching \f[C]secret*.jpg\f[] and include
\f[C]file2.avi\f[].
Everything else will be excluded from the sync.
.SS \f[C]\-\-files\-from\f[] \- Read list of source\-file names
.PP
This reads a list of file names from the file passed in and
\f[B]only\f[] these files are transferred.
The filtering rules are ignored completely if you use this option.
.PP
Prepare a file like this \f[C]files\-from.txt\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ comment
file1.jpg
file2.jpg
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then use as \f[C]\-\-files\-from\ files\-from.txt\f[].
This will only transfer \f[C]file1.jpg\f[] and \f[C]file2.jpg\f[]
providing they exist.
.SS \f[C]\-\-min\-size\f[] \- Don\[aq]t transfer any file smaller than
this
.PP
This option controls the minimum size file which will be transferred.
This defaults to \f[C]kBytes\f[] but a suffix of \f[C]k\f[], \f[C]M\f[],
or \f[C]G\f[] can be used.
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-min\-size\ 50k\f[] means no files smaller than
50kByte will be transferred.
.SS \f[C]\-\-max\-size\f[] \- Don\[aq]t transfer any file larger than
this
.PP
This option controls the maximum size file which will be transferred.
This defaults to \f[C]kBytes\f[] but a suffix of \f[C]k\f[], \f[C]M\f[],
or \f[C]G\f[] can be used.
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-max\-size\ 1G\f[] means no files larger than 1GByte
will be transferred.
.SS \f[C]\-\-max\-age\f[] \- Don\[aq]t transfer any file older than this
.PP
This option controls the maximum age of files to transfer.
Give in seconds or with a suffix of:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]ms\f[] \- Milliseconds
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]s\f[] \- Seconds
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]m\f[] \- Minutes
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]h\f[] \- Hours
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]d\f[] \- Days
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]w\f[] \- Weeks
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]M\f[] \- Months
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]y\f[] \- Years
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-max\-age\ 2d\f[] means no files older than 2 days
will be transferred.
.SS \f[C]\-\-min\-age\f[] \- Don\[aq]t transfer any file younger than
this
.PP
This option controls the minimum age of files to transfer.
Give in seconds or with a suffix (see \f[C]\-\-max\-age\f[] for list of
suffixes)
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-min\-age\ 2d\f[] means no files younger than 2 days
will be transferred.
.SS \f[C]\-\-delete\-excluded\f[] \- Delete files on dest excluded from
sync
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[] this flag is dangerous \- use with
\f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] and \f[C]\-v\f[] first.
.PP
When doing \f[C]rclone\ sync\f[] this will delete any files which are
excluded from the sync on the destination.
.PP
If for example you did a sync from \f[C]A\f[] to \f[C]B\f[] without the
\f[C]\-\-min\-size\ 50k\f[] flag
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ A:\ B:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then you repeated it like this with the \f[C]\-\-delete\-excluded\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ \-\-min\-size\ 50k\ \-\-delete\-excluded\ sync\ A:\ B:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This would delete all files on \f[C]B\f[] which are less than 50 kBytes
as these are now excluded from the sync.
.PP
Always test first with \f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] and \f[C]\-v\f[] before
using this flag.
.SS \f[C]\-\-dump\-filters\f[] \- dump the filters to the output
.PP
This dumps the defined filters to the output as regular expressions.
.PP
Useful for debugging.
.SS Quoting shell metacharacters
.PP
The examples above may not work verbatim in your shell as they have
shell metacharacters in them (eg \f[C]*\f[]), and may require quoting.
.PP
Eg linux, OSX
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include\ \\*.jpg\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include\ \[aq]*.jpg\[aq]\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include=\[aq]*.jpg\[aq]\f[]
.PP
In Windows the expansion is done by the command not the shell so this
should work fine
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include\ *.jpg\f[]
.SH Overview of cloud storage systems

Each cloud storage system is slighly different.
Rclone attempts to provide a unified interface to them, but some
underlying differences show through.

.SS Hash
.PP
The cloud storage system supports various hash types of the objects.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
The hashes are used when transferring data as an integrity check and can
be specifically used with the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag in syncs and in
the \f[C]check\f[] command.
.PP
To use the checksum checks between filesystems they must support a
common hash type.
.SS ModTime
.PP
The cloud storage system supports setting modification times on objects.
If it does then this enables a using the modification times as part of
the sync.
If not then only the size will be checked by default, though the MD5SUM
can be checked with the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.PP
All cloud storage systems support some kind of date on the object and
these will be set when transferring from the cloud storage system.
.SS Case Insensitive
.PP
If a cloud storage systems is case sensitive then it is possible to have
two files which differ only in case, eg \f[C]file.txt\f[] and
\f[C]FILE.txt\f[].
If a cloud storage system is case insensitive then that isn\[aq]t
possible.
.PP
This can cause problems when syncing between a case insensitive system
and a case sensitive system.
The symptom of this is that no matter how many times you run the sync it
never completes fully.
.PP
The local filesystem may or may not be case sensitive depending on OS.
.IP \[bu] 2
Windows \- usually case insensitive, though case is preserved
.IP \[bu] 2
OSX \- usually case insensitive, though it is possible to format case
sensitive
.IP \[bu] 2
Linux \- usually case sensitive, but there are case insensitive file
systems (eg FAT formatted USB keys)
.PP
Most of the time this doesn\[aq]t cause any problems as people tend to
avoid files whose name differs only by case even on case sensitive
systems.
.SS Duplicate files
.PP
If a cloud storage system allows duplicate files then it can have two
objects with the same name.
.PP
This confuses rclone greatly when syncing \- use the
\f[C]rclone\ dedupe\f[] command to rename or remove duplicates.
.SS Google Drive
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]drive:path\f[]
.PP
Drive paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]drive:directory/subdirectory\f[].
.PP
The initial setup for drive involves getting a token from Google drive
which you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone\ config\f[] walks you through it.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[].
First run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall, or use
manual mode.
.PP
You can then use it like this,

\f[C]
rclone\ lsd\ remote:

.PP

.PP

.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ /home/source\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.SS Modified time
.PP
Google drive stores modification times accurate to 1 ms.
.SS Revisions
.PP
Google drive stores revisions of files.
When you upload a change to an existing file to google drive using
rclone it will create a new revision of that file.
.PP
Revisions follow the standard google policy which at time of writing was
.IP \[bu] 2
They are deleted after 30 days or 100 revisions (whatever comes first).
.IP \[bu] 2
They do not count towards a user storage quota.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
By default rclone will delete files permanently when requested.
If sending them to the trash is required instead then use the
\f[C]\-\-drive\-use\-trash\f[] flag.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-drive\-chunk\-size=SIZE
.PP
Upload chunk size.
Must a power of 2 >= 256k.
Default value is 8 MB.
.PP
Making this larger will improve performance, but note that each chunk is
buffered in memory one per transfer.
.PP
Reducing this will reduce memory usage but decrease performance.
.SS \-\-drive\-full\-list
.PP
No longer does anything \- kept for backwards compatibility.
.SS \-\-drive\-upload\-cutoff=SIZE
.PP
File size cutoff for switching to chunked upload.
Default is 8 MB.
.SS \-\-drive\-use\-trash
.PP
Send files to the trash instead of deleting permanently.
Defaults to off, namely deleting files permanently.
.SS \-\-drive\-auth\-owner\-only
.PP
Only consider files owned by the authenticated user.
Requires that \-\-drive\-full\-list=true (default).
.SS \-\-drive\-formats
.PP
Google documents can only be exported from Google drive.
When rclone downloads a Google doc it chooses a format to download
depending upon this setting.
.PP
By default the formats are \f[C]docx,xlsx,pptx,svg\f[] which are a
sensible default for an editable document.
.PP
When choosing a format, rclone runs down the list provided in order and
chooses the first file format the doc can be exported as from the list.
If the file can\[aq]t be exported to a format on the formats list, then
rclone will choose a format from the default list.
.PP
If you prefer an archive copy then you might use
\f[C]\-\-drive\-formats\ pdf\f[], or if you prefer
openoffice/libreoffice formats you might use
\f[C]\-\-drive\-formats\ ods,odt\f[].
.PP
Note that rclone adds the extension to the google doc, so if it is
calles \f[C]My\ Spreadsheet\f[] on google docs, it will be exported as
\f[C]My\ Spreadsheet.xlsx\f[] or \f[C]My\ Spreadsheet.pdf\f[] etc.

.SS Limitations
.PP
Drive has quite a lot of rate limiting.
This causes rclone to be limited to transferring about 2 files per
second only.
Individual files may be transferred much faster at 100s of MBytes/s but
lots of small files can take a long time.
.SS Amazon S3
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:bucket\f[] (or \f[C]remote:\f[] for
the \f[C]lsd\f[] command.) You may put subdirectories in too, eg
\f[C]remote:bucket/path/to/dir\f[].

.SS Multipart uploads
.PP
rclone supports multipart uploads with S3 which means that it can upload
files bigger than 5GB.
Note that files uploaded with multipart upload don\[aq]t have an MD5SUM.
.SS Buckets and Regions
.PP
With Amazon S3 you can list buckets (\f[C]rclone\ lsd\f[]) using any
region, but you can only access the content of a bucket from the region
it was created in.
If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong region, you will get an
error,
\f[C]incorrect\ region,\ the\ bucket\ is\ not\ in\ \[aq]XXX\[aq]\ region\f[].
.SS Authentication
.PP
There are two ways to supply \f[C]rclone\f[] with a set of AWS
credentials.
In order of precedence:
.IP \[bu] 2
Directly in the rclone configuration file (as configured by
\f[C]rclone\ config\f[])
.IP \[bu] 2
set \f[C]access_key_id\f[] and \f[C]secret_access_key\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
Runtime configuration:
.IP \[bu] 2
set \f[C]env_auth\f[] to \f[C]true\f[] in the config file
.IP \[bu] 2
Exporting the following environment variables before running
\f[C]rclone\f[]
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
Access Key ID: \f[C]AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\f[] or \f[C]AWS_ACCESS_KEY\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
Secret Access Key: \f[C]AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\f[] or
\f[C]AWS_SECRET_KEY\f[]
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2

If none of these option actually end up providing \f[C]rclone\f[] with
AWS credentials then S3 interaction will be non\-authenticated (see
below).
.SS Anonymous access to public buckets
.PP
If you want to use rclone to access a public bucket, configure with a
blank \f[C]access_key_id\f[] and \f[C]secret_access_key\f[].
Eg

.PP
Then use it as normal with the name of the public bucket, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ lsd\ anons3:1000genomes
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You will be able to list and copy data but not upload it.
.SS Ceph
.PP
Ceph is an object storage system which presents an Amazon S3 interface.
.PP
To use rclone with ceph, you need to set the following parameters in the
config.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
access_key_id\ =\ Whatever
secret_access_key\ =\ Whatever
endpoint\ =\ https://ceph.endpoint.goes.here/
region\ =\ other\-v2\-signature
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note also that Ceph sometimes puts \f[C]/\f[] in the passwords it gives
users.
If you read the secret access key using the command line tools you will
get a JSON blob with the \f[C]/\f[] escaped as \f[C]\\/\f[].
Make sure you only write \f[C]/\f[] in the secret access key.
.PP
Eg the dump from Ceph looks something like this (irrelevant keys
removed).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
\ \ \ \ "user_id":\ "xxx",
\ \ \ \ "display_name":\ "xxxx",
\ \ \ \ "keys":\ [
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "user":\ "xxx",
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "access_key":\ "xxxxxx",
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "secret_key":\ "xxxxxx\\/xxxx"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }
\ \ \ \ ],
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Because this is a json dump, it is encoding the \f[C]/\f[] as
\f[C]\\/\f[], so if you use the secret key as \f[C]xxxxxx/xxxx\f[] it
will work fine.
.SS Swift
.PP
Swift refers to Openstack Object
Storage (http://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-storage/).
Commercial implementations of that being:
.IP \[bu] 2
Rackspace Cloud Files (http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/)

.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:container\f[] (or \f[C]remote:\f[]
for the \f[C]lsd\f[] command.) You may put subdirectories in too, eg
\f[C]remote:container/path/to/dir\f[].

.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-swift\-chunk\-size=SIZE
.PP
Above this size files will be chunked into a _segments container.
The default for this is 5GB which is its maximum value.
.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X\-Object\-Meta\-Mtime\f[] as floating point since the epoch
accurate to 1 ns.
.PP
This is a defacto standard (used in the official python\-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.
.SS Limitations
.PP
The Swift API doesn\[aq]t return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won\[aq]t check or use the
MD5SUM for these.
.SS Troubleshooting
.SS Rclone gives Failed to create file system for "remote:": Bad Request
.PP
Due to an oddity of the underlying swift library, it gives a "Bad
Request" error rather than a more sensible error when the authentication
fails for Swift.
.PP
So this most likely means your username / password is wrong.
You can investigate further with the \f[C]\-\-dump\-bodies\f[] flag.
.SS Rclone gives Failed to create file system: Response didn\[aq]t have
storage storage url and auth token
.PP
This is most likely caused by forgetting to specify your tenant when
setting up a swift remote.
.SS Dropbox
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[]
.PP
Dropbox paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[].
.PP
The initial setup for dropbox involves getting a token from Dropbox
which you need to do in your browser.

.SS Modified time and MD5SUMs
.PP
Dropbox doesn\[aq]t provide the ability to set modification times in the
V1 public API, so rclone can\[aq]t support modified time with Dropbox.
.PP
This may change in the future \- see these issues for details:
.IP \[bu] 2
Dropbox V2 API (https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/349)
.IP \[bu] 2
Allow syncs for remotes that can\[aq]t set modtime on existing
objects (https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/348)
.PP
Dropbox doesn\[aq]t return any sort of checksum (MD5 or SHA1).
.PP
Together that means that syncs to dropbox will effectively have the
\f[C]\-\-size\-only\f[] flag set.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-dropbox\-chunk\-size=SIZE
.PP
Upload chunk size.
Max 150M.
The default is 128MB.
Note that this isn\[aq]t buffered into memory.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Dropbox is case insensitive so you can\[aq]t have a file
called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".
.PP
There are some file names such as \f[C]thumbs.db\f[] which Dropbox
can\[aq]t store.
There is a full list of them in the "Ignored Files" section of this
document (https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/145).
Rclone will issue an error message
\f[C]File\ name\ disallowed\ \-\ not\ uploading\f[] if it attempt to
upload one of those file names, but the sync won\[aq]t fail.
.PP
If you have more than 10,000 files in a directory then
\f[C]rclone\ purge\ dropbox:dir\f[] will return the error
\f[C]Failed\ to\ purge:\ There\ are\ too\ many\ files\ involved\ in\ this\ operation\f[].
As a work\-around do an \f[C]rclone\ delete\ dropbix:dir\f[] followed by
an \f[C]rclone\ rmdir\ dropbox:dir\f[].
.SS Google Cloud Storage
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:bucket\f[] (or \f[C]remote:\f[] for
the \f[C]lsd\f[] command.) You may put subdirectories in too, eg
\f[C]remote:bucket/path/to/dir\f[].

.SS Service Account support
.PP
You can set up rclone with Google Cloud Storage in an unattended mode,
i.e.
not tied to a specific end\-user Google account.
This is useful when you want to synchronise files onto machines that
don\[aq]t have actively logged\-in users, for example build machines.
.PP
To get credentials for Google Cloud Platform IAM Service
Accounts (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts), please
head to the Service
Account (https://console.cloud.google.com/permissions/serviceaccounts)
section of the Google Developer Console.
Service Accounts behave just like normal \f[C]User\f[] permissions in
Google Cloud Storage
ACLs (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control), so you can
limit their access (e.g.
make them read only).
After creating an account, a JSON file containing the Service
Account\[aq]s credentials will be downloaded onto your machines.
These credentials are what rclone will use for authentication.
.PP
To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path to
your Service Account credentials at the \f[C]service_account_file\f[]
prompt and rclone won\[aq]t use the browser based authentication flow.
.SS Modified time
.PP
Google google cloud storage stores md5sums natively and rclone stores
modification times as metadata on the object, under the "mtime" key in
RFC3339 format accurate to 1ns.

.PP
It does store MD5SUMs so for a more accurate sync, you can use the
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.
Amazon don\[aq]t provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to
empty the trash, so you will have to do that with one of Amazon\[aq]s
apps or via the Amazon cloud drive website.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-acd\-templink\-threshold=SIZE

This is to work around a problem with Amazon Cloud Drive which blocks
downloads of files bigger than about 10GB.
The default for this is 9GB which shouldn\[aq]t need to be changed.
.PP
To download files above this threshold, rclone requests a
\f[C]tempLink\f[] which downloads the file through a temporary URL
directly from the underlying S3 storage.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Amazon cloud drive is case insensitive so you can\[aq]t have a
file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".
.PP
Amazon cloud drive has rate limiting so you may notice errors in the
sync (429 errors).
rclone will automatically retry the sync up to 3 times by default (see
\f[C]\-\-retries\f[] flag) which should hopefully work around this
problem.
.PP
Amazon cloud drive has an internal limit of file sizes that can be
uploaded to the service.
This limit is not officially published, but all files larger than this
will fail.
.PP
At the time of writing (Jan 2016) is in the area of 50GB per file.
This means that larger files are likely to fail.
.PP
Unfortunatly there is no way for rclone to see that this failure is
because of file size, so it will retry the operation, as any other
failure.
To avoid this problem, use \f[C]\-\-max\-size=50GB\f[] option to limit
the maximum size of uploaded files.
.SS Microsoft One Drive
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[].
.PP
The initial setup for One Drive involves getting a token from Microsoft
which you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone\ config\f[] walks you through it.

See the remote setup docs (http://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Microsoft.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[] like this,

.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
One Drive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
.PP
One drive supports SHA1 type hashes, so you can use
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.
Microsoft doesn\[aq]t provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to
empty the trash, so you will have to do that with one of Microsoft\[aq]s
apps or via the One Drive website.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-onedrive\-chunk\-size=SIZE
.PP
Above this size files will be chunked \- must be multiple of 320k.
The default is 10MB.
Note that the chunks will be buffered into memory.
.SS \-\-onedrive\-upload\-cutoff=SIZE
.PP
Cutoff for switching to chunked upload \- must be <= 100MB.
The default is 10MB.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that One Drive is case insensitive so you can\[aq]t have a file
called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".
.PP
Rclone only supports your default One Drive, and doesn\[aq]t work with
One Drive for business.
Both these issues may be fixed at some point depending on user demand!
.PP
There are quite a few characters that can\[aq]t be in One Drive file
names.
These can\[aq]t occur on Windows platforms, but on non\-Windows
platforms they are common.
Rclone will map these names to and from an identical looking unicode
equivalent.
For example if a file has a \f[C]?\f[] in it will be mapped to
\f[C]？\f[] instead.
.SS Hubic
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[]
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:container\f[] (or \f[C]remote:\f[]
for the \f[C]lsd\f[] command.) You may put subdirectories in too, eg
\f[C]remote:container/path/to/dir\f[].

.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X\-Object\-Meta\-Mtime\f[] as floating point since the epoch
accurate to 1 ns.
.PP
This is a defacto standard (used in the official python\-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.
.PP
Note that Hubic wraps the Swift backend, so most of the properties of
are the same.
.SS Limitations
.PP
This uses the normal OpenStack Swift mechanism to refresh the Swift API
credentials and ignores the expires field returned by the Hubic API.
.PP
The Swift API doesn\[aq]t return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won\[aq]t check or use the
MD5SUM for these.
.SS Backblaze B2
.PP
B2 is Backblaze\[aq]s cloud storage
system (https://www.backblaze.com/b2/).
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:bucket\f[] (or \f[C]remote:\f[] for

.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X\-Bz\-Info\-src_last_modified_millis\f[] as milliseconds since
1970\-01\-01 in the Backblaze standard.
Other tools should be able to use this as a modified time.
.PP
Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported except in the
case of updating a modification time on an existing object.
In this case the object will be uploaded again as B2 doesn\[aq]t have an
API method to set the modification time independent of doing an upload.
.SS SHA1 checksums
.PP
The SHA1 checksums of the files are checked on upload and download and
will be used in the syncing process.
You can use the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.PP
Large files which are uploaded in chunks will store their SHA1 on the
object as \f[C]X\-Bz\-Info\-large_file_sha1\f[] as recommended by
Backblaze.
.SS Versions
.PP
When rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a new version of
it (https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/file_versions.html).
Likewise when you delete a file, the old version will still be
available.
.PP
The old versions of files are visible in the B2 web interface, but not
via rclone yet.
.PP
Rclone doesn\[aq]t provide any way of managing old versions (downloading
them or deleting them) at the moment.
When you \f[C]purge\f[] a bucket, all the old versions will be deleted.
.SS Transfers
.PP
Backblaze recommends that you do lots of transfers simultaneously for
maximum speed.
In tests from my SSD equiped laptop the optimum setting is about
\f[C]\-\-transfers\ 32\f[] though higher numbers may be used for a
slight speed improvement.
The optimum number for you may vary depending on your hardware, how big
the files are, how much you want to load your computer, etc.
The default of \f[C]\-\-transfers\ 4\f[] is definitely too low for
Backblaze B2 though.
.SS Specific options
.PP
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.
.SS \-\-b2\-chunk\-size valuee=SIZE
.PP
When uploading large files chunk the file into this size.
Note that these chunks are buffered in memory.
100,000,000 Bytes is the minimim size (default 96M).
.SS \-\-b2\-upload\-cutoff=SIZE
.PP
Cutoff for switching to chunked upload (default 4.657GiB == 5GB).
Files above this size will be uploaded in chunks of
\f[C]\-\-b2\-chunk\-size\f[].
The default value is the largest file which can be uploaded without
chunks.
.SS API
.PP
Here are some notes I made on the backblaze
API (https://gist.github.com/ncw/166dabf352b399f1cc1c) while integrating
it with rclone.
.SS Yandex Disk
.PP
Yandex Disk (https://disk.yandex.com) is a cloud storage solution
created by Yandex (http://yandex.com).
.PP
Yandex paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[].

.fi
.PP
See the remote setup docs (http://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Yandex Disk.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[] like this,
.PP
See top level directories
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ lsd\ remote:
\f[]

excess files in the path.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

\f[]
.fi
.SS Modified time
.PP
Modified times are supported and are stored accurate to 1 ns in custom
metadata called \f[C]rclone_modified\f[] in RFC3339 with nanoseconds
format.
.SS MD5 checksums
.PP
MD5 checksums are natively supported by Yandex Disk.
.SS Local Filesystem
.PP
Local paths are specified as normal filesystem paths, eg
\f[C]/path/to/wherever\f[], so
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ /home/source\ /tmp/destination
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Will sync \f[C]/home/source\f[] to \f[C]/tmp/destination\f[]
.PP
These can be configured into the config file for consistencies sake, but
it is probably easier not to.
.SS Modified time
.PP
Rclone reads and writes the modified time using an accuracy determined
by the OS.
Typically this is 1ns on Linux, 10 ns on Windows and 1 Second on OS X.
.SS Filenames
.PP
Filenames are expected to be encoded in UTF\-8 on disk.
This is the normal case for Windows and OS X.
.PP
There is a bit more uncertainty in the Linux world, but new
distributions will have UTF\-8 encoded files names.
If you are using an old Linux filesystem with non UTF\-8 file names (eg
latin1) then you can use the \f[C]convmv\f[] tool to convert the
filesystem to UTF\-8.
This tool is available in most distributions\[aq] package managers.
.PP
If an invalid (non\-UTF8) filename is read, the invalid caracters will
be replaced with the unicode replacement character, \[aq]�\[aq].
\f[C]rclone\f[] will emit a debug message in this case (use \f[C]\-v\f[]
to see), eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Local\ file\ system\ at\ .:\ Replacing\ invalid\ UTF\-8\ characters\ in\ "gro\\xdf"
\f[]
.fi
.SS Long paths on Windows
.PP
Rclone handles long paths automatically, by converting all paths to long
UNC
paths (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx#maxpath)
which allows paths up to 32,767 characters.
.PP
This is why you will see that your paths, for instance
\f[C]c:\\files\f[] is converted to the UNC path
\f[C]\\\\?\\c:\\files\f[] in the output, and \f[C]\\\\server\\share\f[]
is converted to \f[C]\\\\?\\UNC\\server\\share\f[].
.PP
However, in rare cases this may cause problems with buggy file system
drivers like EncFS (https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/261).
To disable UNC conversion globally, add this to your
\f[C]\&.rclone.conf\f[] file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[local]
nounc\ =\ true
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you want to selectively disable UNC, you can add it to a separate
entry like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[nounc]
type\ =\ local
nounc\ =\ true
\f[]
.fi
.PP
And use rclone like this:
.PP
\f[C]rclone\ copy\ c:\\src\ nounc:z:\\dst\f[]
.PP
This will use UNC paths on \f[C]c:\\src\f[] but not on \f[C]z:\\dst\f[].
Of course this will cause problems if the absolute path length of a file
exceeds 258 characters on z, so only use this option if you have to.

.SS Empty directories are left behind / not created
.PP
With remotes that have a concept of directory, eg Local and Drive, empty
directories may be left behind, or not created when one was expected.
.PP
This is because rclone doesn\[aq]t have a concept of a directory \- it
only works on objects.
Most of the object storage systems can\[aq]t actually store a directory
so there is nowhere for rclone to store anything about directories.
.PP
You can work round this to some extent with the\f[C]purge\f[] command
which will delete everything under the path, \f[B]inluding\f[] empty
directories.
.PP
This may be fixed at some point in Issue
#100 (https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/100)
.SS Directory timestamps aren\[aq]t preserved
.PP
For the same reason as the above, rclone doesn\[aq]t have a concept of a
directory \- it only works on objects, therefore it can\[aq]t preserve
the timestamps of directories.
.SS Frequently Asked Questions
.SS Do all cloud storage systems support all rclone commands
.PP
Yes they do.
All the rclone commands (eg \f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[] etc) will work
on all the remote storage systems.
.SS Can I copy the config from one machine to another
.PP
Sure! Rclone stores all of its config in a single file.
If you want to find this file, the simplest way is to run
\f[C]rclone\ \-h\f[] and look at the help for the \f[C]\-\-config\f[]
flag which will tell you where it is.
.PP
See the remote setup docs (http://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for more
info.
.SS How do I configure rclone on a remote / headless box with no
browser?
.PP
This has now been documented in its own remote setup
page (http://rclone.org/remote_setup/).
.SS Can rclone sync directly from drive to s3
.PP
Rclone can sync between two remote cloud storage systems just fine.
.PP
Note that it effectively downloads the file and uploads it again, so the
node running rclone would need to have lots of bandwidth.
.PP
The syncs would be incremental (on a file by file basis).
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ drive:Folder\ s3:bucket
\f[]
.fi
.SS Using rclone from multiple locations at the same time
.PP
You can use rclone from multiple places at the same time if you choose
different subdirectory for the output, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Server\ A>\ rclone\ sync\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:ServerA
Server\ B>\ rclone\ sync\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:ServerB
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you sync to the same directory then you should use rclone copy
otherwise the two rclones may delete each others files, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Server\ A>\ rclone\ copy\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:Backup
Server\ B>\ rclone\ copy\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:Backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The file names you upload from Server A and Server B should be different
in this case, otherwise some file systems (eg Drive) may make
duplicates.
.SS Why doesn\[aq]t rclone support partial transfers / binary diffs like
rsync?
.PP
Rclone stores each file you transfer as a native object on the remote
cloud storage system.
This means that you can see the files you upload as expected using
alternative access methods (eg using the Google Drive web interface).
There is a 1:1 mapping between files on your hard disk and objects
created in the cloud storage system.
.PP
Cloud storage systems (at least none I\[aq]ve come across yet) don\[aq]t
support partially uploading an object.
You can\[aq]t take an existing object, and change some bytes in the
middle of it.
.PP
It would be possible to make a sync system which stored binary diffs
instead of whole objects like rclone does, but that would break the 1:1
mapping of files on your hard disk to objects in the remote cloud
storage system.
.PP
All the cloud storage systems support partial downloads of content, so
it would be possible to make partial downloads work.
However to make this work efficiently this would require storing a
significant amount of metadata, which breaks the desired 1:1 mapping of
files to objects.
.SS Can rclone do bi\-directional sync?
.PP
No, not at present.
rclone only does uni\-directional sync from A \-> B.
It may do in the future though since it has all the primitives \- it
just requires writing the algorithm to do it.
.SS Can I use rclone with an HTTP proxy?
.PP
Yes.
rclone will use the environment variables \f[C]HTTP_PROXY\f[],
\f[C]HTTPS_PROXY\f[] and \f[C]NO_PROXY\f[], similar to cURL and other
programs.
.PP
\f[C]HTTPS_PROXY\f[] takes precedence over \f[C]HTTP_PROXY\f[] for https
requests.
.PP
The environment values may be either a complete URL or a "host[:port]",
in which case the "http" scheme is assumed.
.PP
The \f[C]NO_PROXY\f[] allows you to disable the proxy for specific
hosts.
Hosts must be comma separated, and can contain domains or parts.
For instance "foo.com" also matches "bar.foo.com".
.SS Rclone gives x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided
error
.PP
This means that \f[C]rclone\f[] can\[aq]t file the SSL root
certificates.
Likely you are running \f[C]rclone\f[] on a NAS with a cut\-down Linux
OS, or possibly on Solaris.
.PP
Rclone (via the Go runtime) tries to load the root certificates from
these places on Linux.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
"/etc/ssl/certs/ca\-certificates.crt",\ //\ Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo\ etc.
"/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca\-bundle.crt",\ \ \ //\ Fedora/RHEL
"/etc/ssl/ca\-bundle.pem",\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ //\ OpenSUSE
"/etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem",\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ //\ OpenELEC
\f[]
.fi
.PP
So doing something like this should fix the problem.
It also sets the time which is important for SSL to work properly.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
mkdir\ \-p\ /etc/ssl/certs/
curl\ \-o\ /etc/ssl/certs/ca\-certificates.crt\ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca\-bundle/master/ca\-bundle.crt
ntpclient\ \-s\ \-h\ pool.ntp.org
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that you may need to add the \f[C]\-\-insecure\f[] option to the
\f[C]curl\f[] command line if it doesn\[aq]t work without.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
curl\ \-\-insecure\ \-o\ /etc/ssl/certs/ca\-certificates.crt\ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca\-bundle/master/ca\-bundle.crt
\f[]
.fi
.SS Rclone gives Failed to load config file: function not implemented
error
.PP
Likely this means that you are running rclone on Linux version not
supported by the go runtime, ie earlier than version 2.6.23.
.PP
See the system requirements section in the go install
docs (https://golang.org/doc/install) for full details.
.SS All my uploaded docx/xlsx/pptx files appear as archive/zip
.PP
This is caused by uploading these files from a Windows computer which
hasn\[aq]t got the Microsoft Office suite installed.
The easiest way to fix is to install the Word viewer and the Microsoft
Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 and later
versions\[aq] file formats
