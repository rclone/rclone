.SS About rclone
.PP
Rclone is a command line program to manage files on cloud storage.
It is a feature rich alternative to cloud vendors\[cq] web storage
interfaces.
Over 40 cloud storage products support rclone including S3 object
stores, business & consumer file storage services, as well as standard
transfer protocols.
.PP
Rclone has powerful cloud equivalents to the unix commands rsync, cp,
mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat.
Rclone\[cq]s familiar syntax includes shell pipeline support, and
\f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[R] protection.
It is used at the command line, in scripts or via its API (/rc).
.PP
Users call rclone \f[I]\[lq]The Swiss army knife of cloud
storage\[rq]\f[R], and \f[I]\[lq]Technology indistinguishable from
magic\[rq]\f[R].
.PP
Rclone really looks after your data.
It preserves timestamps and verifies checksums at all times.
Transfers over limited bandwidth; intermittent connections, or subject
to quota can be restarted, from the last good file transferred.
You can check (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/) the integrity
of your files.
Where possible, rclone employs server side transfers to minimise local
bandwidth use and transfers from one provider to another without using
local disk.
.PP
Virtual backends wrap local and cloud file systems to apply
encryption (https://rclone.org/crypt/),
caching (https://rclone.org/cache/),
chunking (https://rclone.org/chunker/) and
joining (https://rclone.org/union/).
.PP
Rclone mounts (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) any local,
cloud or virtual filesystem as a disk on Windows, macOS, linux and
FreeBSD, and also serves these over
SFTP (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_sftp/),
HTTP (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_http/),
WebDAV (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_webdav/),
FTP (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_ftp/) and
DLNA (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_dlna/).
.PP
Rclone is mature, open source software originally inspired by rsync and
written in Go (https://golang.org).
The friendly support community are familiar with varied use cases.
Official Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Brew and Chocolatey repos.
include rclone.
For the latest version downloading from
rclone.org (https://rclone.org/downloads/) is recommended.
.PP
Rclone is widely used on Linux, Windows and Mac.
Third party developers create innovative backup, restore, GUI and
business process solutions using the rclone command line or API.
.PP
Rclone does the heavy lifting of communicating with cloud storage.

.SS macOS installation from precompiled binary, using a web browser
.PP
When downloading a binary with a web browser, the browser will set the
macOS gatekeeper quarantine attribute.
Starting from Catalina, when attempting to run \f[C]rclone\f[R], a
pop\-up will appear saying:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\[lq]rclone\[rq] cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The simplest fix is to run
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
xattr \-d com.apple.quarantine rclone
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Install with docker
.PP
The rclone maintains a docker image for
rclone (https://hub.docker.com/r/rclone/rclone).
These images are autobuilt by docker hub from the rclone source based on
a minimal Alpine linux image.
.PP
The \f[C]:latest\f[R] tag will always point to the latest stable
release.
You can use the \f[C]:beta\f[R] tag to get the latest build from master.
You can also use version tags, eg \f[C]:1.49.1\f[R], \f[C]:1.49\f[R] or
\f[C]:1\f[R].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ docker pull rclone/rclone:latest

\f[R]
.fi
.PP
There are a few command line options to consider when starting an rclone
Docker container from the rclone image.
.IP \[bu] 2
You need to mount the host rclone config dir at \f[C]/config/rclone\f[R]
into the Docker container.
Due to the fact that rclone updates tokens inside its config file, and
that the update process involves a file rename, you need to mount the
whole host rclone config dir, not just the single host rclone config
file.
.IP \[bu] 2
You need to mount a host data dir at \f[C]/data\f[R] into the Docker
container.
.IP \[bu] 2
By default, the rclone binary inside a Docker container runs with UID=0
(root).
As a result, all files created in a run will have UID=0.
If your config and data files reside on the host with a non\-root
UID:GID, you need to pass these on the container start command line.
.IP \[bu] 2
It is possible to use \f[C]rclone mount\f[R] inside a userspace Docker
container, and expose the resulting fuse mount to the host.
The exact \f[C]docker run\f[R] options to do that might vary slightly
between hosts.
See, e.g.\ the discussion in this
thread (https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/9448).
.RS 2
.PP
You also need to mount the host \f[C]/etc/passwd\f[R] and
\f[C]/etc/group\f[R] for fuse to work inside the container.
.RE
.PP
Here are some commands tested on an Ubuntu 18.04.3 host:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# config on host at \[ti]/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
# data on host at \[ti]/data

# make sure the config is ok by listing the remotes
docker run \-\-rm \[rs]
    \-\-volume \[ti]/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \[rs]
    \-\-volume \[ti]/data:/data:shared \[rs]
    \-\-user $(id \-u):$(id \-g) \[rs]
    rclone/rclone \[rs]
    listremotes

# perform mount inside Docker container, expose result to host
mkdir \-p \[ti]/data/mount
docker run \-\-rm \[rs]
    \-\-volume \[ti]/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \[rs]
    \-\-volume \[ti]/data:/data:shared \[rs]
    \-\-user $(id \-u):$(id \-g) \[rs]
    \-\-volume /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro \-\-volume /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \[rs]
    \-\-device /dev/fuse \-\-cap\-add SYS_ADMIN \-\-security\-opt apparmor:unconfined \[rs]
    rclone/rclone \[rs]
    mount dropbox:Photos /data/mount &
ls \[ti]/data/mount
kill %1
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Install from source
.PP
Make sure you have at least Go (https://golang.org/) 1.7 installed.
Download go (https://golang.org/dl/) if necessary.
The latest release is recommended.
Then
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
git clone https://github.com/rclone/rclone.git
cd rclone
go build
\&./rclone version
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You can also build and install rclone in the
GOPATH (https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH) (which defaults to
\f[C]\[ti]/go\f[R]) with:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
go get \-u \-v github.com/rclone/rclone
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
and this will build the binary in \f[C]$GOPATH/bin\f[R]
(\f[C]\[ti]/go/bin/rclone\f[R] by default) after downloading the source
to \f[C]$GOPATH/src/github.com/rclone/rclone\f[R]
(\f[C]\[ti]/go/src/github.com/rclone/rclone\f[R] by default).
.SS Installation with Ansible
.PP
This can be done with Stefan Weichinger\[cq]s ansible
role (https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone).
.PP
Instructions
.IP "1." 3
\f[C]git clone https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible\-rclone.git\f[R]
into your local roles\-directory
.IP "2." 3
add the role to the hosts you want rclone installed to:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
    \- hosts: rclone\-hosts
      roles:
          \- rclone
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Configure
.PP
First, you\[cq]ll need to configure rclone.
As the object storage systems have quite complicated authentication
these are kept in a config file.
(See the \f[C]\-\-config\f[R] entry for how to find the config file and
choose its location.)
.PP
The easiest way to make the config is to run rclone with the config
option:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone config
\f[R]

.SS Usage
.PP
Rclone syncs a directory tree from one storage system to another.
.PP
Its syntax is like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Syntax: [options] subcommand <parameters> <parameters...>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Source and destination paths are specified by the name you gave the
storage system in the config file then the sub path, eg
\[lq]drive:myfolder\[rq] to look at \[lq]myfolder\[rq] in Google drive.
.PP
You can define as many storage paths as you like in the config file.
.SS Subcommands
.PP
rclone uses a system of subcommands.
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone ls remote:path # lists a remote
rclone copy /local/path remote:path # copies /local/path to the remote
rclone sync /local/path remote:path # syncs /local/path to the remote
\f[R]
.fi
.SH rclone config

.SH rclone copy
.PP
Copy files from source to dest, skipping already copied
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Copy the source to the destination.
Doesn\[cq]t transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification
time or MD5SUM.
Doesn\[cq]t delete files from the destination.
.PP
Note that it is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not
the directory so when source:path is a directory, it\[cq]s the contents
of source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.
.PP
If dest:path doesn\[cq]t exist, it is created and the source:path
contents go there.
.PP
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy source:sourcepath dest:destpath
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Let\[cq]s say there are two files in sourcepath
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

.fi
.PP
This copies them to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

If you are familiar with \f[C]rsync\f[R], rclone always works as if you
had written a trailing / \- meaning \[lq]copy the contents of this
directory\[rq].
This applies to all commands and whether you are talking about the
source or destination.
.PP
See the \[en]no\-traverse (https://rclone.org/docs/#no-traverse) option
for controlling whether rclone lists the destination directory or not.
Supplying this option when copying a small number of files into a large
destination can speed transfers up greatly.
.PP
For example, if you have many files in /path/to/src but only a few of
them change every day, you can copy all the files which have changed
recently very efficiently like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy \-\-max\-age 24h \-\-no\-traverse /path/to/src remote:

.SH rclone sync
.PP
Make source and dest identical, modifying destination only.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only.
Doesn\[cq]t transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification
time or MD5SUM.
Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files if
necessary.
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[R]: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
\f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[R] flag to see exactly what would be copied and
deleted.
.PP
Note that files in the destination won\[cq]t be deleted if there were
any errors at any point.
.PP
It is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not the
directory so when source:path is a directory, it\[cq]s the contents of
source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.
See extended explanation in the \f[C]copy\f[R] command above if unsure.
.PP
If dest:path doesn\[cq]t exist, it is created and the source:path
contents go there.

.SH rclone move
.PP
Move files from source to dest.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination directory.
Rclone will error if the source and destination overlap and the remote
does not support a server side directory move operation.
.PP
If no filters are in use and if possible this will server side move
\f[C]source:path\f[R] into \f[C]dest:path\f[R].
After this \f[C]source:path\f[R] will no longer exist.
.PP
Otherwise for each file in \f[C]source:path\f[R] selected by the filters
(if any) this will move it into \f[C]dest:path\f[R].
If possible a server side move will be used, otherwise it will copy it
(server side if possible) into \f[C]dest:path\f[R] then delete the
original (if no errors on copy) in \f[C]source:path\f[R].
.PP
If you want to delete empty source directories after move, use the
\[en]delete\-empty\-src\-dirs flag.
.PP
See the \[en]no\-traverse (https://rclone.org/docs/#no-traverse) option
for controlling whether rclone lists the destination directory or not.

.SH rclone delete
.PP
Remove the contents of path.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Remove the files in path.
Unlike \f[C]purge\f[R] it obeys include/exclude filters so can be used
to selectively delete files.
.PP
\f[C]rclone delete\f[R] only deletes objects but leaves the directory
structure alone.
If you want to delete a directory and all of its contents use
\f[C]rclone purge\f[R]
.PP
If you supply the \[en]rmdirs flag, it will remove all empty directories
along with it.
.PP
Eg delete all files bigger than 100MBytes
.PP

.IP
.nf
\f[C]

.SS Synopsis
.PP
Checks the files in the source and destination match.
It compares sizes and hashes (MD5 or SHA1) and logs a report of files
which don\[cq]t match.
It doesn\[cq]t alter the source or destination.
.PP
If you supply the \[en]size\-only flag, it will only compare the sizes
not the hashes as well.
Use this for a quick check.
.PP
If you supply the \[en]download flag, it will download the data from
both remotes and check them against each other on the fly.
This can be useful for remotes that don\[cq]t support hashes or if you
really want to check all the data.
.PP
If you supply the \[en]one\-way flag, it will only check that files in
source match the files in destination, not the other way around.
Meaning extra files in destination that are not in the source will not
trigger an error.

.SH rclone config create
.PP
Create a new remote with name, type and options.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Create a new remote of \f[C]name\f[R] with \f[C]type\f[R] and options.
The options should be passed in pairs of \f[C]key\f[R] \f[C]value\f[R].
.PP
For example to make a swift remote of name myremote using auto config
you would do:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone config create myremote swift env_auth true
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that if the config process would normally ask a question the
default is taken.
Each time that happens rclone will print a message saying how to affect
the value taken.
.PP
If any of the parameters passed is a password field, then rclone will
automatically obscure them if they aren\[cq]t already obscured before
putting them in the config file.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] If the password parameter is 22 characters or longer and
consists only of base64 characters then rclone can get confused about
whether the password is already obscured or not and put unobscured
passwords into the config file.
If you want to be 100% certain that the passwords get obscured then use
the \[lq]\[en]obscure\[rq] flag, or if you are 100% certain you are
already passing obscured passwords then use \[lq]\[en]no\-obscure\[rq].
You can also set osbscured passwords using the \[lq]rclone config
password\[rq] command.
.PP
So for example if you wanted to configure a Google Drive remote but
using remote authorization you would do this:
.IP

Copy files from source to dest, skipping already copied
.SS Synopsis
.PP
If source:path is a file or directory then it copies it to a file or
directory named dest:path.
.PP
This can be used to upload single files to other than their current
name.
If the source is a directory then it acts exactly like the copy command.
.PP
So
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copyto src dst
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
where src and dst are rclone paths, either remote:path or /path/to/local
or C:.
.PP
This will:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
if src is file
    copy it to dst, overwriting an existing file if it exists
if src is directory
    copy it to dst, overwriting existing files if they exist
    see copy command for full details
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This doesn\[cq]t transfer unchanged files, testing by size and
modification time or MD5SUM.
It doesn\[cq]t delete files from the destination.

.SH rclone cryptcheck
.PP
Cryptcheck checks the integrity of a crypted remote.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone cryptcheck checks a remote against a crypted remote.
This is the equivalent of running rclone check, but able to check the
checksums of the crypted remote.
.PP
For it to work the underlying remote of the cryptedremote must support
some kind of checksum.
.PP
It works by reading the nonce from each file on the cryptedremote: and
using that to encrypt each file on the remote:.
It then checks the checksum of the underlying file on the cryptedremote:
against the checksum of the file it has just encrypted.
.PP
Use it like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone cryptcheck /path/to/files encryptedremote:path
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You can use it like this also, but that will involve downloading all the
files in remote:path.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone cryptcheck remote:path encryptedremote:path
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
After it has run it will log the status of the encryptedremote:.
.PP
If you supply the \[en]one\-way flag, it will only check that files in
source match the files in destination, not the other way around.
Meaning extra files in destination that are not in the source will not
trigger an error.

.SH rclone lsf
.PP
List directories and objects in remote:path formatted for parsing
.SS Synopsis
.PP
List the contents of the source path (directories and objects) to
standard output in a form which is easy to parse by scripts.
By default this will just be the names of the objects and directories,
one per line.
The directories will have a / suffix.
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone lsf swift:bucket
bevajer5jef
canole
diwogej7
ferejej3gux/
fubuwic
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Use the \[en]format option to control what gets listed.
By default this is just the path, but you can use these parameters to
control the output:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
p \- path
s \- size
t \- modification time
h \- hash
i \- ID of object
o \- Original ID of underlying object
m \- MimeType of object if known
e \- encrypted name
T \- tier of storage if known, eg \[dq]Hot\[dq] or \[dq]Cool\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
So if you wanted the path, size and modification time, you would use
\[en]format \[lq]pst\[rq], or maybe \[en]format \[lq]tsp\[rq] to put the
path last.
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone lsf  \-\-format \[dq]tsp\[dq] swift:bucket

2016\-06\-25 18:55:40;37600;fubuwic
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you specify \[lq]h\[rq] in the format you will get the MD5 hash by
default, use the \[lq]\[en]hash\[rq] flag to change which hash you want.
Note that this can be returned as an empty string if it isn\[cq]t
available on the object (and for directories), \[lq]ERROR\[rq] if there
was an error reading it from the object and \[lq]UNSUPPORTED\[rq] if
that object does not support that hash type.
.PP
For example to emulate the md5sum command you can use
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsf \-R \-\-hash MD5 \-\-format hp \-\-separator \[dq]  \[dq] \-\-files\-only .
\f[R]
.fi

.PP
(Though \[lq]rclone md5sum .\[rq] is an easier way of typing this.)
.PP
By default the separator is \[lq];\[rq] this can be changed with the
\[en]separator flag.
Note that separators aren\[cq]t escaped in the path so putting it last
is a good strategy.

(\[lq]2017\-05\-31T16:15:57.034+01:00\[rq]) whereas if the times are

.SH rclone mount
.PP
Mount the remote as file system on a mountpoint.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone mount allows Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows to mount any of
Rclone\[cq]s cloud storage systems as a file system with FUSE.
.PP
First set up your remote using \f[C]rclone config\f[R].
Check it works with \f[C]rclone ls\f[R] etc.
.PP
You can either run mount in foreground mode or background (daemon) mode.
Mount runs in foreground mode by default, use the \[en]daemon flag to
specify background mode mode.
Background mode is only supported on Linux and OSX, you can only run
mount in foreground mode on Windows.
.PP
On Linux/macOS/FreeBSD Start the mount like this where
\f[C]/path/to/local/mount\f[R] is an \f[B]empty\f[R] \f[B]existing\f[R]
directory.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone mount remote:path/to/files /path/to/local/mount
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or on Windows like this where \f[C]X:\f[R] is an unused drive letter or
use a path to \f[B]non\-existent\f[R] directory.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:
rclone mount remote:path/to/files C:\[rs]path\[rs]to\[rs]nonexistent\[rs]directory
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When running in background mode the user will have to stop the mount
manually (specified below).
.PP
When the program ends while in foreground mode, either via Ctrl+C or
receiving a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, the mount is automatically
stopped.
.PP
The umount operation can fail, for example when the mountpoint is busy.
When that happens, it is the user\[cq]s responsibility to stop the mount
manually.
.PP
Stopping the mount manually:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# Linux
fusermount \-u /path/to/local/mount
# OS X
umount /path/to/local/mount
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Installing on Windows
.PP
To run rclone mount on Windows, you will need to download and install
WinFsp (http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/).
.PP
WinFsp (https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp) is an open source Windows
File System Proxy which makes it easy to write user space file systems
for Windows.
It provides a FUSE emulation layer which rclone uses combination with
cgofuse (https://github.com/billziss-gh/cgofuse).
Both of these packages are by Bill Zissimopoulos who was very helpful
during the implementation of rclone mount for Windows.
.SS Windows caveats
.PP
Note that drives created as Administrator are not visible by other
accounts (including the account that was elevated as Administrator).
So if you start a Windows drive from an Administrative Command Prompt
and then try to access the same drive from Explorer (which does not run
as Administrator), you will not be able to see the new drive.
.PP
The easiest way around this is to start the drive from a normal command
prompt.
It is also possible to start a drive from the SYSTEM account (using the
WinFsp.Launcher
infrastructure (https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp/wiki/WinFsp-Service-Architecture))
which creates drives accessible for everyone on the system or
alternatively using the nssm service manager (https://nssm.cc/usage).
.SS Mount as a network drive
.PP
By default, rclone will mount the remote as a normal drive.
However, you can also mount it as a \f[B]Network Drive\f[R] (or
\f[B]Network Share\f[R], as mentioned in some places)
.PP
Unlike other systems, Windows provides a different filesystem type for
network drives.
Windows and other programs treat the network drives and fixed/removable
drives differently: In network drives, many I/O operations are
optimized, as the high latency and low reliability (compared to a normal
drive) of a network is expected.
.PP
Although many people prefer network shares to be mounted as normal
system drives, this might cause some issues, such as programs not
working as expected or freezes and errors while operating with the
mounted remote in Windows Explorer.
If you experience any of those, consider mounting rclone remotes as
network shares, as Windows expects normal drives to be fast and
reliable, while cloud storage is far from that.
See also Limitations section below for more info
.PP
Add \[lq]\[en]fuse\-flag \[en]VolumePrefix=\[rq] to your \[lq]mount\[rq]
command, \f[B]replacing \[lq]share\[rq] with any other name of your
choice if you are mounting more than one remote\f[R].
Otherwise, the mountpoints will conflict and your mounted filesystems
will overlap.
.PP
Read more about drive
mapping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_mapping)
.SS Limitations
.PP
Without the use of \[lq]\[en]vfs\-cache\-mode\[rq] this can only write
files sequentially, it can only seek when reading.
This means that many applications won\[cq]t work with their files on an
rclone mount without \[lq]\[en]vfs\-cache\-mode writes\[rq] or
\[lq]\[en]vfs\-cache\-mode full\[rq].
See the File Caching section for more info.
.PP
The bucket based remotes (eg Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2,
Hubic) do not support the concept of empty directories, so empty
directories will have a tendency to disappear once they fall out of the
directory cache.
.PP
Only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OS X and Windows at the moment.
.SS rclone mount vs rclone sync/copy
.PP
File systems expect things to be 100% reliable, whereas cloud storage
systems are a long way from 100% reliable.
The rclone sync/copy commands cope with this with lots of retries.
However rclone mount can\[cq]t use retries in the same way without
making local copies of the uploads.
Look at the file caching for solutions to make mount more reliable.
.SS Attribute caching
.PP
You can use the flag \[en]attr\-timeout to set the time the kernel
caches the attributes (size, modification time etc) for directory
entries.
.PP
The default is \[lq]1s\[rq] which caches files just long enough to avoid
too many callbacks to rclone from the kernel.
.PP
In theory 0s should be the correct value for filesystems which can
change outside the control of the kernel.
However this causes quite a few problems such as rclone using too much
memory (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2157), rclone not
serving files to
samba (https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-1-39-vs-1-40-mount-issue/5112)
and excessive time listing
directories (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2095#issuecomment-371141147).
.PP
The kernel can cache the info about a file for the time given by
\[lq]\[en]attr\-timeout\[rq].
You may see corruption if the remote file changes length during this
window.
It will show up as either a truncated file or a file with garbage on the
end.
With \[lq]\[en]attr\-timeout 1s\[rq] this is very unlikely but not
impossible.
The higher you set \[lq]\[en]attr\-timeout\[rq] the more likely it is.
The default setting of \[lq]1s\[rq] is the lowest setting which
mitigates the problems above.
.PP
If you set it higher (`10s' or `1m' say) then the kernel will call back
to rclone less often making it more efficient, however there is more
chance of the corruption issue above.
.PP
If files don\[cq]t change on the remote outside of the control of rclone
then there is no chance of corruption.
.PP
This is the same as setting the attr_timeout option in mount.fuse.
.SS Filters
.PP
Note that all the rclone filters can be used to select a subset of the
files to be visible in the mount.
.SS systemd
.PP
When running rclone mount as a systemd service, it is possible to use
Type=notify.
In this case the service will enter the started state after the
mountpoint has been successfully set up.
Units having the rclone mount service specified as a requirement will
see all files and folders immediately in this mode.
.SS chunked reading
.PP
\[en]vfs\-read\-chunk\-size will enable reading the source objects in
parts.
This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting
only chunks from the remote that are actually read at the cost of an
increased number of requests.
.PP
When \[en]vfs\-read\-chunk\-size\-limit is also specified and greater
than \[en]vfs\-read\-chunk\-size, the chunk size for each open file will
get doubled for each chunk read, until the specified value is reached.
A value of \-1 will disable the limit and the chunk size will grow
indefinitely.
.PP
With \[en]vfs\-read\-chunk\-size 100M and
\[en]vfs\-read\-chunk\-size\-limit 0 the following parts will be
downloaded: 0\-100M, 100M\-200M, 200M\-300M, 300M\-400M and so on.
When \[en]vfs\-read\-chunk\-size\-limit 500M is specified, the result
would be 0\-100M, 100M\-300M, 300M\-700M, 700M\-1200M, 1200M\-1700M and
so on.
.PP
Chunked reading will only work with \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode < full, as the
file will always be copied to the vfs cache before opening with
\[en]vfs\-cache\-mode full.
.SS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]\-\-dir\-cache\-time\f[R] flag, you can set how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate
the cache.
However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once the
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes.
If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up on within the
polling interval.
.PP
Alternatively, you can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[R] signal to rclone for it
to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill \-SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control (/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\f[R] flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file descriptor will try to keep the specified amount of data
in memory at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one file descriptor and won\[cq]t be
shared between multiple open file descriptors of the same file.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per file descriptor.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]\-\-buffer\-size * open files\f[R].
.SS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
The VFS layer is used by rclone mount to make a cloud storage system
work more like a normal file system.
.PP
You\[cq]ll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read
and write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-cache\-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache. (default 1h0m0s)
\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode string              Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default \[dq]off\[dq])
\-\-vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects. (default 1m0s)
\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-size int             Max total size of objects in the cache. (default off)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]\-vv\f[R] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]\-\-cache\-dir\f[R] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode\f[R].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won\[cq]t get
written back to the remote.
However they will still be in the on disk cache.
.PP
If using \[en]vfs\-cache\-max\-size note that the cache may exceed this
size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\[en]vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval.
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode off
.PP
In this mode the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can\[cq]t be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can\[cq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
.IP \[bu] 2
Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[cq]t be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[lq]off\[rq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disks.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.
.PP
These operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only can\[cq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[cq]t be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried up to \[en]low\-level\-retries
times.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When a file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety
first.
.PP
This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the
cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.
.PP
In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk, it
will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote.
It will be purged on a schedule according to
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age\f[R].
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload or download fails it will be retried up to
\[en]low\-level\-retries times.
.SS Case Sensitivity
.PP
Linux file systems are case\-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.
.PP
Windows is not like most other operating systems supported by rclone.
File systems in modern Windows are case\-insensitive but
case\-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case,
the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for
programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by
case.
.PP
Usually file systems on macOS are case\-insensitive.
It is possible to make macOS file systems case\-sensitive but that is
not the default
.PP
The \[lq]\[en]vfs\-case\-insensitive\[rq] mount flag controls how rclone
handles these two cases.
If its value is \[lq]false\[rq], rclone passes file names to the mounted
file system as is.
If the flag is \[lq]true\[rq] (or appears without a value on command
line), rclone may perform a \[lq]fixup\[rq] as explained below.
.PP
The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system.
If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name,
then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used.
However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a
name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the
name.
This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested.
Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by
an underlying mounted file system.
.PP
Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by
rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether \[lq]fixup\[rq] is performed to satisfy the
target.
.PP
If the flag is not provided on command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: \[lq]true\[rq] on
Windows and macOS, \[lq]false\[rq] otherwise.
If the flag is provided without a value, then it is \[lq]true\[rq].

.PP
If the remote file already exists, it will be overwritten.
.PP
rcat will try to upload small files in a single request, which is
usually more efficient than the streaming/chunked upload endpoints,
which use multiple requests.
Exact behaviour depends on the remote.
What is considered a small file may be set through
\f[C]\-\-streaming\-upload\-cutoff\f[R].
Uploading only starts after the cutoff is reached or if the file ends
before that.
The data must fit into RAM.
The cutoff needs to be small enough to adhere the limits of your remote,
please see there.
Generally speaking, setting this cutoff too high will decrease your
performance.
.PP
Note that the upload can also not be retried because the data is not
kept around until the upload succeeds.
If you need to transfer a lot of data, you\[cq]re better off caching
locally and then \f[C]rclone move\f[R] it to the destination.

.SH rclone serve dlna
.PP
Serve remote:path over DLNA
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve dlna is a DLNA media server for media stored in an rclone
remote.
Many devices, such as the Xbox and PlayStation, can automatically
discover this server in the LAN and play audio/video from it.
VLC is also supported.
Service discovery uses UDP multicast packets (SSDP) and will thus only
work on LANs.
.PP
Rclone will list all files present in the remote, without filtering
based on media formats or file extensions.
Additionally, there is no media transcoding support.
This means that some players might show files that they are not able to
play back correctly.
.SS Server options
.PP
Use \[en]addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg \[en]addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or \[en]addr :8080 to listen to all
IPs.
.PP
Use \[en]name to choose the friendly server name, which is by default
\[lq]rclone (hostname)\[rq].
.PP
Use \[en]log\-trace in conjunction with \-vv to enable additional debug
logging of all UPNP traffic.
.SS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]\-\-dir\-cache\-time\f[R] flag, you can set how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate
the cache.
However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once the
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes.
If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up on within the
polling interval.
.PP
Alternatively, you can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[R] signal to rclone for it
to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill \-SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control (/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\f[R] flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file descriptor will try to keep the specified amount of data
in memory at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one file descriptor and won\[cq]t be
shared between multiple open file descriptors of the same file.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per file descriptor.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]\-\-buffer\-size * open files\f[R].
.SS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
The VFS layer is used by rclone mount to make a cloud storage system
work more like a normal file system.
.PP
You\[cq]ll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read
and write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-cache\-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache. (default 1h0m0s)
\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode string              Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default \[dq]off\[dq])
\-\-vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects. (default 1m0s)
\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-size int             Max total size of objects in the cache. (default off)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]\-vv\f[R] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]\-\-cache\-dir\f[R] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode\f[R].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won\[cq]t get
written back to the remote.
However they will still be in the on disk cache.
.PP
If using \[en]vfs\-cache\-max\-size note that the cache may exceed this
size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\[en]vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval.
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode off
.PP
In this mode the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can\[cq]t be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can\[cq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
.IP \[bu] 2
Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[cq]t be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[lq]off\[rq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disks.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.
.PP
These operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only can\[cq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2

.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[cq]t be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried up to \[en]low\-level\-retries
times.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When a file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety
first.
.PP
This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the
cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.
.PP
In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk, it
will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote.
It will be purged on a schedule according to
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age\f[R].
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload or download fails it will be retried up to
\[en]low\-level\-retries times.
.SS Case Sensitivity
.PP
Linux file systems are case\-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.
.PP
Windows is not like most other operating systems supported by rclone.
File systems in modern Windows are case\-insensitive but
case\-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case,
the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for
programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by
case.
.PP
Usually file systems on macOS are case\-insensitive.
It is possible to make macOS file systems case\-sensitive but that is
not the default
.PP
The \[lq]\[en]vfs\-case\-insensitive\[rq] mount flag controls how rclone
handles these two cases.
If its value is \[lq]false\[rq], rclone passes file names to the mounted
file system as is.
If the flag is \[lq]true\[rq] (or appears without a value on command
line), rclone may perform a \[lq]fixup\[rq] as explained below.
.PP
The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system.
If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name,
then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used.
However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a
name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the
name.
This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested.
Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by
an underlying mounted file system.
.PP
Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by
rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether \[lq]fixup\[rq] is performed to satisfy the
target.
.PP
If the flag is not provided on command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: \[lq]true\[rq] on
Windows and macOS, \[lq]false\[rq] otherwise.
If the flag is provided without a value, then it is \[lq]true\[rq].

rclone serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/) \- Serve a
remote over a protocol.
.SH rclone serve ftp
.PP
Serve remote:path over FTP.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve ftp implements a basic ftp server to serve the remote over
FTP protocol.
This can be viewed with a ftp client or you can make a remote of type
ftp to read and write it.
.SS Server options
.PP
Use \[en]addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg \[en]addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or \[en]addr :8080 to listen to all
IPs.
By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
.PP
If you set \[en]addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised \- see the next section for info.
.SS Authentication
.PP
By default this will serve files without needing a login.
.PP
You can set a single username and password with the \[en]user and
\[en]pass flags.
.SS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]\-\-dir\-cache\-time\f[R] flag, you can set how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate
the cache.
However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once the
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes.
If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up on within the
polling interval.
.PP
Alternatively, you can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[R] signal to rclone for it
to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill \-SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control (/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\f[R] flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file descriptor will try to keep the specified amount of data
in memory at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one file descriptor and won\[cq]t be
shared between multiple open file descriptors of the same file.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per file descriptor.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]\-\-buffer\-size * open files\f[R].
.SS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
The VFS layer is used by rclone mount to make a cloud storage system
work more like a normal file system.
.PP
You\[cq]ll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read
and write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-cache\-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache. (default 1h0m0s)
\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode string              Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default \[dq]off\[dq])
\-\-vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects. (default 1m0s)
\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-size int             Max total size of objects in the cache. (default off)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]\-vv\f[R] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]\-\-cache\-dir\f[R] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode\f[R].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won\[cq]t get
written back to the remote.
However they will still be in the on disk cache.
.PP
If using \[en]vfs\-cache\-max\-size note that the cache may exceed this
size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\[en]vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval.
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode off
.PP
In this mode the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can\[cq]t be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can\[cq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
.IP \[bu] 2
Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[cq]t be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[lq]off\[rq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disks.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.
.PP
These operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only can\[cq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[cq]t be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried up to \[en]low\-level\-retries
times.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When a file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety
first.
.PP
This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the
cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.
.PP
In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk, it
will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote.
It will be purged on a schedule according to
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age\f[R].
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload or download fails it will be retried up to
\[en]low\-level\-retries times.
.SS Case Sensitivity
.PP
Linux file systems are case\-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.
.PP
Windows is not like most other operating systems supported by rclone.
File systems in modern Windows are case\-insensitive but
case\-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case,
the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for
programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by
case.
.PP
Usually file systems on macOS are case\-insensitive.
It is possible to make macOS file systems case\-sensitive but that is
not the default
.PP
The \[lq]\[en]vfs\-case\-insensitive\[rq] mount flag controls how rclone
handles these two cases.
If its value is \[lq]false\[rq], rclone passes file names to the mounted
file system as is.
If the flag is \[lq]true\[rq] (or appears without a value on command
line), rclone may perform a \[lq]fixup\[rq] as explained below.
.PP
The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system.
If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name,
then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used.
However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a
name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the
name.
This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested.
Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by
an underlying mounted file system.
.PP
Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by
rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether \[lq]fixup\[rq] is performed to satisfy the
target.
.PP
If the flag is not provided on command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: \[lq]true\[rq] on
Windows and macOS, \[lq]false\[rq] otherwise.
If the flag is provided without a value, then it is \[lq]true\[rq].
.SS Auth Proxy
.PP
If you supply the parameter \f[C]\-\-auth\-proxy /path/to/program\f[R]
then rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which
then are used to authenticate incoming requests.
This uses a simple JSON based protocl with input on STDIN and output on
STDOUT.
.PP
\f[B]PLEASE NOTE:\f[R] \f[C]\-\-auth\-proxy\f[R] and
\f[C]\-\-authorized\-keys\f[R] cannot be used together, if
\f[C]\-\-auth\-proxy\f[R] is set the authorized keys option will be
ignored.
.PP
There is an example program
bin/test_proxy.py (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.
.PP
The program\[cq]s job is to take a \f[C]user\f[R] and \f[C]pass\f[R] on
the input and turn those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON
format.
This config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but
it won\[cq]t use configuration from environment variables or command
line options \- it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete
config.
.PP
This config generated must have this extra parameter \- \f[C]_root\f[R]
\- root to use for the backend
.PP
And it may have this parameter \- \f[C]_obscure\f[R] \- comma separated
strings for parameters to obscure
.PP
If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If public\-key authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]public_key\[dq]: \[dq]AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And as an example return this on STDOUT
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]type\[dq]: \[dq]sftp\[dq],
    \[dq]_root\[dq]: \[dq]\[dq],
    \[dq]_obscure\[dq]: \[dq]pass\[dq],
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq],
    \[dq]host\[dq]: \[dq]sftp.example.com\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the
\f[C]user\f[R] and \f[C]pass\f[R]/\f[C]public_key\f[R] returned in the
output to the host given.
Note that since \f[C]_obscure\f[R] is set to \f[C]pass\f[R], rclone will
obscure the \f[C]pass\f[R] parameter before creating the backend (which
is required for sftp backends).
.PP
The program can manipulate the supplied \f[C]user\f[R] in any way, for
example to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make
the \f[C]user\f[R] be \f[C]user\[at]example.com\f[R] and then set the
\f[C]host\f[R] to \f[C]example.com\f[R] in the output and the user to
\f[C]user\f[R].
For security you\[cq]d probably want to restrict the \f[C]host\f[R] to a
limited list.
.PP
Note that an internal cache is keyed on \f[C]user\f[R] so only use that
for configuration, don\[cq]t use \f[C]pass\f[R] or \f[C]public_key\f[R].
This also means that if a user\[cq]s password or public\-key is changed
the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it takes
effect.
.PP
This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.

.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve http implements a basic web server to serve the remote over
HTTP.
This can be viewed in a web browser or you can make a remote of type
http read from it.
.PP
You can use the filter flags (eg \[en]include, \[en]exclude) to control
what is served.
.PP
The server will log errors.
Use \-v to see access logs.
.PP
\[en]bwlimit will be respected for file transfers.
Use \[en]stats to control the stats printing.
.SS Server options
.PP
Use \[en]addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg \[en]addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or \[en]addr :8080 to listen to all
IPs.
By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
.PP
If you set \[en]addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised \- see the next section for info.
.PP
\[en]server\-read\-timeout and \[en]server\-write\-timeout can be used
to control the timeouts on the server.
Note that this is the total time for a transfer.
.PP
\[en]max\-header\-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server
will accept in the HTTP header.
.PP
\[en]baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.
By default rclone will serve from the root.
If you used \[en]baseurl \[lq]/rclone\[rq] then rclone would serve from
a URL starting with \[lq]/rclone/\[rq].
This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.
Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing \[lq]/\[rq] on
\[en]baseurl, so \[en]baseurl \[lq]rclone\[rq], \[en]baseurl
\[lq]/rclone\[rq] and \[en]baseurl \[lq]/rclone/\[rq] are all treated
identically.
.PP
\[en]template allows a user to specify a custom markup template for http

.SS Authentication
.PP
By default this will serve files without needing a login.
.PP
You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the \[en]user and \[en]pass flags.
.PP
Use \[en]htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file.
This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for
basic authentication.
Bcrypt is recommended.
.PP
To create an htpasswd file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
touch htpasswd
htpasswd \-B htpasswd user
htpasswd \-B htpasswd anotherUser
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The password file can be updated while rclone is running.
.PP
Use \[en]realm to set the authentication realm.
.SS SSL/TLS
.PP
By default this will serve over http.
If you want you can serve over https.
You will need to supply the \[en]cert and \[en]key flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need
to supply \[en]client\-ca also.
.PP
\[en]cert should be either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation
of that with the CA certificate.
\[en]key should be the PEM encoded private key and \[en]client\-ca
should be the PEM encoded client certificate authority certificate.
.SS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]\-\-dir\-cache\-time\f[R] flag, you can set how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate
the cache.
However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once the
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes.
If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up on within the
polling interval.
.PP
Alternatively, you can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[R] signal to rclone for it
to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill \-SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control (/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\f[R] flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file descriptor will try to keep the specified amount of data
in memory at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one file descriptor and won\[cq]t be
shared between multiple open file descriptors of the same file.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per file descriptor.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]\-\-buffer\-size * open files\f[R].
.SS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
The VFS layer is used by rclone mount to make a cloud storage system
work more like a normal file system.
.PP
You\[cq]ll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read
and write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-cache\-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache. (default 1h0m0s)
\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode string              Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default \[dq]off\[dq])
\-\-vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects. (default 1m0s)
\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-size int             Max total size of objects in the cache. (default off)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]\-vv\f[R] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]\-\-cache\-dir\f[R] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode\f[R].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won\[cq]t get
written back to the remote.
However they will still be in the on disk cache.
.PP
If using \[en]vfs\-cache\-max\-size note that the cache may exceed this
size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\[en]vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval.
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode off
.PP
In this mode the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can\[cq]t be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can\[cq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
.IP \[bu] 2
Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[cq]t be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[lq]off\[rq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disks.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.
.PP
These operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only can\[cq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[cq]t be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried up to \[en]low\-level\-retries
times.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When a file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety
first.
.PP
This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the
cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.
.PP
In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk, it
will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote.
It will be purged on a schedule according to
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age\f[R].
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload or download fails it will be retried up to
\[en]low\-level\-retries times.
.SS Case Sensitivity
.PP
Linux file systems are case\-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.
.PP
Windows is not like most other operating systems supported by rclone.
File systems in modern Windows are case\-insensitive but
case\-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case,
the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for
programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by
case.
.PP
Usually file systems on macOS are case\-insensitive.
It is possible to make macOS file systems case\-sensitive but that is
not the default
.PP
The \[lq]\[en]vfs\-case\-insensitive\[rq] mount flag controls how rclone
handles these two cases.
If its value is \[lq]false\[rq], rclone passes file names to the mounted
file system as is.
If the flag is \[lq]true\[rq] (or appears without a value on command
line), rclone may perform a \[lq]fixup\[rq] as explained below.
.PP
The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system.
If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name,
then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used.
However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a
name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the
name.
This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested.
Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by
an underlying mounted file system.
.PP
Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by
rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether \[lq]fixup\[rq] is performed to satisfy the
target.
.PP
If the flag is not provided on command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: \[lq]true\[rq] on
Windows and macOS, \[lq]false\[rq] otherwise.
If the flag is provided without a value, then it is \[lq]true\[rq].

rclone serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/) \- Serve a
remote over a protocol.
.SH rclone serve restic
.PP
Serve the remote for restic\[cq]s REST API.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve restic implements restic\[cq]s REST backend API over HTTP.
This allows restic to use rclone as a data storage mechanism for cloud
providers that restic does not support directly.
.PP
Restic (https://restic.net/) is a command line program for doing
backups.
.PP
The server will log errors.
Use \-v to see access logs.
.PP
\[en]bwlimit will be respected for file transfers.
Use \[en]stats to control the stats printing.
.SS Setting up rclone for use by restic
.PP
First set up a remote for your chosen cloud
provider (https://rclone.org/docs/#configure).
.PP
Once you have set up the remote, check it is working with, for example
\[lq]rclone lsd remote:\[rq].
You may have called the remote something other than \[lq]remote:\[rq] \-
just substitute whatever you called it in the following instructions.
.PP
Now start the rclone restic server
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone serve restic \-v remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Where you can replace \[lq]backup\[rq] in the above by whatever path in
the remote you wish to use.
.PP
By default this will serve on \[lq]localhost:8080\[rq] you can change
this with use of the \[lq]\[en]addr\[rq] flag.
.PP
You might wish to start this server on boot.
.SS Setting up restic to use rclone
.PP
Now you can follow the restic
instructions (http://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#rest-server)
on setting up restic.
.PP
Note that you will need restic 0.8.2 or later to interoperate with
rclone.
.PP
For the example above you will want to use
\[lq]http://localhost:8080/\[rq] as the URL for the REST server.
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/
$ export RESTIC_PASSWORD=yourpassword
$ restic init
created restic backend 8b1a4b56ae at rest:http://localhost:8080/

Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access
the repository. Losing your password means that your data is
irrecoverably lost.
$ restic backup /path/to/files/to/backup
scan [/path/to/files/to/backup]
scanned 189 directories, 312 files in 0:00
[0:00] 100.00%  38.128 MiB / 38.128 MiB  501 / 501 items  0 errors  ETA 0:00

\f[R]
.fi
.SS Multiple repositories
.PP
Note that you can use the endpoint to host multiple repositories.
Do this by adding a directory name or path after the URL.
Note that these \f[B]must\f[R] end with /.
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user1repo/
# backup user1 stuff
$ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user2repo/
# backup user2 stuff
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Private repositories
.PP
The \[lq]\[en]private\-repos\[rq] flag can be used to limit users to
repositories starting with a path of \f[C]/<username>/\f[R].
.SS Server options
.PP
Use \[en]addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg \[en]addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or \[en]addr :8080 to listen to all
IPs.
By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
.PP
If you set \[en]addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised \- see the next section for info.
.PP
\[en]server\-read\-timeout and \[en]server\-write\-timeout can be used
to control the timeouts on the server.
Note that this is the total time for a transfer.
.PP
\[en]max\-header\-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server
will accept in the HTTP header.
.PP
\[en]baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.
By default rclone will serve from the root.
If you used \[en]baseurl \[lq]/rclone\[rq] then rclone would serve from
a URL starting with \[lq]/rclone/\[rq].
This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.
Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing \[lq]/\[rq] on
\[en]baseurl, so \[en]baseurl \[lq]rclone\[rq], \[en]baseurl
\[lq]/rclone\[rq] and \[en]baseurl \[lq]/rclone/\[rq] are all treated
identically.
.PP
\[en]template allows a user to specify a custom markup template for http
and webdav serve functions.
The server exports the following markup to be used within the template
to server pages:
.PP

.SS Authentication
.PP
By default this will serve files without needing a login.
.PP
You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the \[en]user and \[en]pass flags.
.PP
Use \[en]htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file.
This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for
basic authentication.
Bcrypt is recommended.
.PP
To create an htpasswd file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
touch htpasswd
htpasswd \-B htpasswd user
htpasswd \-B htpasswd anotherUser
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The password file can be updated while rclone is running.
.PP
Use \[en]realm to set the authentication realm.
.SS SSL/TLS
.PP
By default this will serve over http.
If you want you can serve over https.
You will need to supply the \[en]cert and \[en]key flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need
to supply \[en]client\-ca also.
.PP
\[en]cert should be either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation
of that with the CA certificate.
\[en]key should be the PEM encoded private key and \[en]client\-ca
should be the PEM encoded client certificate authority certificate.

rclone serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/) \- Serve a
remote over a protocol.
.SH rclone serve sftp
.PP
Serve the remote over SFTP.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve sftp implements an SFTP server to serve the remote over
SFTP.
This can be used with an SFTP client or you can make a remote of type
sftp to use with it.
.PP
You can use the filter flags (eg \[en]include, \[en]exclude) to control
what is served.
.PP
The server will log errors.
Use \-v to see access logs.
.PP
\[en]bwlimit will be respected for file transfers.
Use \[en]stats to control the stats printing.
.PP
You must provide some means of authentication, either with
\[en]user/\[en]pass, an authorized keys file (specify location with
\[en]authorized\-keys \- the default is the same as ssh), an
\[en]auth\-proxy, or set the \[en]no\-auth flag for no authentication
when logging in.
.PP
Note that this also implements a small number of shell commands so that
it can provide md5sum/sha1sum/df information for the rclone sftp
backend.
This means that is can support SHA1SUMs, MD5SUMs and the about command
when paired with the rclone sftp backend.
.PP
If you don\[cq]t supply a \[en]key then rclone will generate one and
cache it for later use.
.PP
By default the server binds to localhost:2022 \- if you want it to be
reachable externally then supply \[lq]\[en]addr :2022\[rq] for example.
.PP
Note that the default of \[lq]\[en]vfs\-cache\-mode off\[rq] is fine for
the rclone sftp backend, but it may not be with other SFTP clients.
.SS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]\-\-dir\-cache\-time\f[R] flag, you can set how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate
the cache.
However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once the
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes.
If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up on within the
polling interval.
.PP
Alternatively, you can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[R] signal to rclone for it
to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill \-SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control (/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\f[R] flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file descriptor will try to keep the specified amount of data
in memory at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one file descriptor and won\[cq]t be
shared between multiple open file descriptors of the same file.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per file descriptor.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]\-\-buffer\-size * open files\f[R].
.SS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
The VFS layer is used by rclone mount to make a cloud storage system
work more like a normal file system.
.PP
You\[cq]ll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read
and write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP

\-\-cache\-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache. (default 1h0m0s)
\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode string              Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default \[dq]off\[dq])
\-\-vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects. (default 1m0s)
\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-size int             Max total size of objects in the cache. (default off)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]\-vv\f[R] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]\-\-cache\-dir\f[R] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode\f[R].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won\[cq]t get
written back to the remote.
However they will still be in the on disk cache.
.PP
If using \[en]vfs\-cache\-max\-size note that the cache may exceed this
size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\[en]vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval.
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode off
.PP
In this mode the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can\[cq]t be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can\[cq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
.IP \[bu] 2
Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[cq]t be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[lq]off\[rq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disks.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.
.PP
These operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only can\[cq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[cq]t be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried up to \[en]low\-level\-retries
times.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When a file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety
first.
.PP
This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the
cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.
.PP
In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk, it
will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote.
It will be purged on a schedule according to
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age\f[R].
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload or download fails it will be retried up to
\[en]low\-level\-retries times.
.SS Case Sensitivity
.PP
Linux file systems are case\-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.
.PP
Windows is not like most other operating systems supported by rclone.
File systems in modern Windows are case\-insensitive but
case\-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case,
the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for
programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by
case.
.PP
Usually file systems on macOS are case\-insensitive.
It is possible to make macOS file systems case\-sensitive but that is
not the default
.PP
The \[lq]\[en]vfs\-case\-insensitive\[rq] mount flag controls how rclone
handles these two cases.
If its value is \[lq]false\[rq], rclone passes file names to the mounted
file system as is.
If the flag is \[lq]true\[rq] (or appears without a value on command
line), rclone may perform a \[lq]fixup\[rq] as explained below.
.PP
The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system.
If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name,
then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used.
However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a
name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the
name.
This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested.
Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by
an underlying mounted file system.
.PP
Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by
rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether \[lq]fixup\[rq] is performed to satisfy the
target.
.PP
If the flag is not provided on command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: \[lq]true\[rq] on
Windows and macOS, \[lq]false\[rq] otherwise.
If the flag is provided without a value, then it is \[lq]true\[rq].
.SS Auth Proxy
.PP
If you supply the parameter \f[C]\-\-auth\-proxy /path/to/program\f[R]
then rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which
then are used to authenticate incoming requests.
This uses a simple JSON based protocl with input on STDIN and output on
STDOUT.
.PP
\f[B]PLEASE NOTE:\f[R] \f[C]\-\-auth\-proxy\f[R] and
\f[C]\-\-authorized\-keys\f[R] cannot be used together, if
\f[C]\-\-auth\-proxy\f[R] is set the authorized keys option will be
ignored.
.PP
There is an example program
bin/test_proxy.py (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.
.PP
The program\[cq]s job is to take a \f[C]user\f[R] and \f[C]pass\f[R] on
the input and turn those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON
format.
This config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but
it won\[cq]t use configuration from environment variables or command
line options \- it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete
config.
.PP
This config generated must have this extra parameter \- \f[C]_root\f[R]
\- root to use for the backend
.PP
And it may have this parameter \- \f[C]_obscure\f[R] \- comma separated
strings for parameters to obscure
.PP
If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If public\-key authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]public_key\[dq]: \[dq]AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And as an example return this on STDOUT
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]type\[dq]: \[dq]sftp\[dq],
    \[dq]_root\[dq]: \[dq]\[dq],
    \[dq]_obscure\[dq]: \[dq]pass\[dq],
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq],
    \[dq]host\[dq]: \[dq]sftp.example.com\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the
\f[C]user\f[R] and \f[C]pass\f[R]/\f[C]public_key\f[R] returned in the
output to the host given.
Note that since \f[C]_obscure\f[R] is set to \f[C]pass\f[R], rclone will
obscure the \f[C]pass\f[R] parameter before creating the backend (which
is required for sftp backends).
.PP
The program can manipulate the supplied \f[C]user\f[R] in any way, for
example to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make
the \f[C]user\f[R] be \f[C]user\[at]example.com\f[R] and then set the
\f[C]host\f[R] to \f[C]example.com\f[R] in the output and the user to
\f[C]user\f[R].
For security you\[cq]d probably want to restrict the \f[C]host\f[R] to a
limited list.
.PP
Note that an internal cache is keyed on \f[C]user\f[R] so only use that
for configuration, don\[cq]t use \f[C]pass\f[R] or \f[C]public_key\f[R].
This also means that if a user\[cq]s password or public\-key is changed
the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it takes
effect.
.PP
This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.

.IP \[bu] 2
rclone serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/) \- Serve a
remote over a protocol.
.SH rclone serve webdav
.PP
Serve remote:path over webdav.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve webdav implements a basic webdav server to serve the remote
over HTTP via the webdav protocol.
This can be viewed with a webdav client, through a web browser, or you
can make a remote of type webdav to read and write it.
.SS Webdav options
.SS \[en]etag\-hash
.PP
This controls the ETag header.
Without this flag the ETag will be based on the ModTime and Size of the
object.
.PP
If this flag is set to \[lq]auto\[rq] then rclone will choose the first
supported hash on the backend or you can use a named hash such as
\[lq]MD5\[rq] or \[lq]SHA\-1\[rq].
.PP
Use \[lq]rclone hashsum\[rq] to see the full list.
.SS Server options
.PP
Use \[en]addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg \[en]addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or \[en]addr :8080 to listen to all
IPs.
By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
.PP
If you set \[en]addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised \- see the next section for info.
.PP
\[en]server\-read\-timeout and \[en]server\-write\-timeout can be used
to control the timeouts on the server.
Note that this is the total time for a transfer.
.PP
\[en]max\-header\-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server
will accept in the HTTP header.
.PP
\[en]baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.
By default rclone will serve from the root.
If you used \[en]baseurl \[lq]/rclone\[rq] then rclone would serve from
a URL starting with \[lq]/rclone/\[rq].
This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.
Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing \[lq]/\[rq] on
\[en]baseurl, so \[en]baseurl \[lq]rclone\[rq], \[en]baseurl
\[lq]/rclone\[rq] and \[en]baseurl \[lq]/rclone/\[rq] are all treated
identically.
.PP
\[en]template allows a user to specify a custom markup template for http
and webdav serve functions.
The server exports the following markup to be used within the template
to server pages:

.SS Authentication
.PP
By default this will serve files without needing a login.
.PP
You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the \[en]user and \[en]pass flags.
.PP
Use \[en]htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file.
This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for
basic authentication.
Bcrypt is recommended.
.PP
To create an htpasswd file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
touch htpasswd
htpasswd \-B htpasswd user
htpasswd \-B htpasswd anotherUser
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The password file can be updated while rclone is running.
.PP
Use \[en]realm to set the authentication realm.
.SS SSL/TLS
.PP
By default this will serve over http.
If you want you can serve over https.
You will need to supply the \[en]cert and \[en]key flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need
to supply \[en]client\-ca also.
.PP
\[en]cert should be either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation
of that with the CA certificate.
\[en]key should be the PEM encoded private key and \[en]client\-ca
should be the PEM encoded client certificate authority certificate.
.SS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]\-\-dir\-cache\-time\f[R] flag, you can set how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate
the cache.
However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once the
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes.
If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up on within the
polling interval.
.PP
Alternatively, you can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[R] signal to rclone for it
to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill \-SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control (/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\f[R] flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file descriptor will try to keep the specified amount of data
in memory at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one file descriptor and won\[cq]t be
shared between multiple open file descriptors of the same file.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per file descriptor.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]\-\-buffer\-size * open files\f[R].
.SS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
The VFS layer is used by rclone mount to make a cloud storage system
work more like a normal file system.
.PP
You\[cq]ll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read
and write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.

\-\-vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects. (default 1m0s)
\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-size int             Max total size of objects in the cache. (default off)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]\-vv\f[R] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]\-\-cache\-dir\f[R] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode\f[R].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won\[cq]t get
written back to the remote.
However they will still be in the on disk cache.
.PP
If using \[en]vfs\-cache\-max\-size note that the cache may exceed this
size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\[en]vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval.
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode off

.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried up to \[en]low\-level\-retries
times.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When a file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety
first.
.PP
This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the
cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.
.PP
In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk, it
will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote.
It will be purged on a schedule according to
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age\f[R].
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload or download fails it will be retried up to
\[en]low\-level\-retries times.
.SS Case Sensitivity
.PP
Linux file systems are case\-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.
.PP
Windows is not like most other operating systems supported by rclone.
File systems in modern Windows are case\-insensitive but
case\-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case,
the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for
programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by
case.
.PP
Usually file systems on macOS are case\-insensitive.
It is possible to make macOS file systems case\-sensitive but that is
not the default
.PP
The \[lq]\[en]vfs\-case\-insensitive\[rq] mount flag controls how rclone
handles these two cases.
If its value is \[lq]false\[rq], rclone passes file names to the mounted
file system as is.
If the flag is \[lq]true\[rq] (or appears without a value on command
line), rclone may perform a \[lq]fixup\[rq] as explained below.
.PP
The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system.
If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name,
then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used.
However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a
name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the
name.
This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested.
Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by
an underlying mounted file system.
.PP
Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by
rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether \[lq]fixup\[rq] is performed to satisfy the
target.
.PP
If the flag is not provided on command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: \[lq]true\[rq] on
Windows and macOS, \[lq]false\[rq] otherwise.
If the flag is provided without a value, then it is \[lq]true\[rq].
.SS Auth Proxy
.PP
If you supply the parameter \f[C]\-\-auth\-proxy /path/to/program\f[R]
then rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which
then are used to authenticate incoming requests.
This uses a simple JSON based protocl with input on STDIN and output on
STDOUT.
.PP
\f[B]PLEASE NOTE:\f[R] \f[C]\-\-auth\-proxy\f[R] and
\f[C]\-\-authorized\-keys\f[R] cannot be used together, if
\f[C]\-\-auth\-proxy\f[R] is set the authorized keys option will be
ignored.
.PP
There is an example program
bin/test_proxy.py (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.
.PP
The program\[cq]s job is to take a \f[C]user\f[R] and \f[C]pass\f[R] on
the input and turn those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON
format.
This config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but
it won\[cq]t use configuration from environment variables or command
line options \- it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete
config.
.PP
This config generated must have this extra parameter \- \f[C]_root\f[R]
\- root to use for the backend
.PP
And it may have this parameter \- \f[C]_obscure\f[R] \- comma separated
strings for parameters to obscure
.PP
If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If public\-key authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]public_key\[dq]: \[dq]AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And as an example return this on STDOUT
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]type\[dq]: \[dq]sftp\[dq],
    \[dq]_root\[dq]: \[dq]\[dq],
    \[dq]_obscure\[dq]: \[dq]pass\[dq],
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq],
    \[dq]host\[dq]: \[dq]sftp.example.com\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the
\f[C]user\f[R] and \f[C]pass\f[R]/\f[C]public_key\f[R] returned in the
output to the host given.
Note that since \f[C]_obscure\f[R] is set to \f[C]pass\f[R], rclone will
obscure the \f[C]pass\f[R] parameter before creating the backend (which
is required for sftp backends).
.PP
The program can manipulate the supplied \f[C]user\f[R] in any way, for
example to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make
the \f[C]user\f[R] be \f[C]user\[at]example.com\f[R] and then set the
\f[C]host\f[R] to \f[C]example.com\f[R] in the output and the user to
\f[C]user\f[R].
For security you\[cq]d probably want to restrict the \f[C]host\f[R] to a
limited list.
.PP
Note that an internal cache is keyed on \f[C]user\f[R] so only use that
for configuration, don\[cq]t use \f[C]pass\f[R] or \f[C]public_key\f[R].
This also means that if a user\[cq]s password or public\-key is changed
the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it takes
effect.
.PP
This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.

.SS Copying single files
.PP
rclone normally syncs or copies directories.
However, if the source remote points to a file, rclone will just copy
that file.
The destination remote must point to a directory \- rclone will give the
error
\f[C]Failed to create file system for \[dq]remote:file\[dq]: is a file not a directory\f[R]
if it isn\[cq]t.
.PP
For example, suppose you have a remote with a file in called
\f[C]test.jpg\f[R], then you could copy just that file like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy remote:test.jpg /tmp/download
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The file \f[C]test.jpg\f[R] will be placed inside
\f[C]/tmp/download\f[R].
.PP
This is equivalent to specifying
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy \-\-files\-from /tmp/files remote: /tmp/download
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Where \f[C]/tmp/files\f[R] contains the single line
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
test.jpg
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
It is recommended to use \f[C]copy\f[R] when copying individual files,
not \f[C]sync\f[R].
They have pretty much the same effect but \f[C]copy\f[R] will use a lot
less memory.
.SS Syntax of remote paths
.PP
The syntax of the paths passed to the rclone command are as follows.
.SS /path/to/dir
.PP
This refers to the local file system.
.PP
On Windows only \f[C]\[rs]\f[R] may be used instead of \f[C]/\f[R] in
local paths \f[B]only\f[R], non local paths must use \f[C]/\f[R].
.PP
These paths needn\[cq]t start with a leading \f[C]/\f[R] \- if they
don\[cq]t then they will be relative to the current directory.
.SS remote:path/to/dir
.PP
This refers to a directory \f[C]path/to/dir\f[R] on \f[C]remote:\f[R] as
defined in the config file (configured with \f[C]rclone config\f[R]).
.SS remote:/path/to/dir
.PP
On most backends this is refers to the same directory as
\f[C]remote:path/to/dir\f[R] and that format should be preferred.
On a very small number of remotes (FTP, SFTP, Dropbox for business) this
will refer to a different directory.
On these, paths without a leading \f[C]/\f[R] will refer to your
\[lq]home\[rq] directory and paths with a leading \f[C]/\f[R] will refer
to the root.
.SS :backend:path/to/dir
.PP
This is an advanced form for creating remotes on the fly.
\f[C]backend\f[R] should be the name or prefix of a backend (the
\f[C]type\f[R] in the config file) and all the configuration for the
backend should be provided on the command line (or in environment
variables).
.PP
Here are some examples:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd \-\-http\-url https://pub.rclone.org :http:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To list all the directories in the root of
\f[C]https://pub.rclone.org/\f[R].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsf \-\-http\-url https://example.com :http:path/to/dir

.PP
To list files and directories in

.IP
.nf
\f[C]

.SS Quoting and the shell
.PP
When you are typing commands to your computer you are using something
called the command line shell.
This interprets various characters in an OS specific way.
.PP
Here are some gotchas which may help users unfamiliar with the shell
rules
.SS Linux / OSX
.PP
If your names have spaces or shell metacharacters (eg \f[C]*\f[R],
\f[C]?\f[R], \f[C]$\f[R], \f[C]\[aq]\f[R], \f[C]\[dq]\f[R] etc) then you
must quote them.
Use single quotes \f[C]\[aq]\f[R] by default.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy \[aq]Important files?\[aq] remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you want to send a \f[C]\[aq]\f[R] you will need to use
\f[C]\[dq]\f[R], eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy \[dq]O\[aq]Reilly Reviews\[dq] remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The rules for quoting metacharacters are complicated and if you want the
full details you\[cq]ll have to consult the manual page for your shell.
.SS Windows
.PP
If your names have spaces in you need to put them in \f[C]\[dq]\f[R], eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy \[dq]E:\[rs]folder name\[rs]folder name\[rs]folder name\[dq] remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you are using the root directory on its own then don\[cq]t quote it
(see #464 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/464) for why), eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy E:\[rs] remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Copying files or directories with \f[C]:\f[R] in the names
.PP
rclone uses \f[C]:\f[R] to mark a remote name.
This is, however, a valid filename component in non\-Windows OSes.
The remote name parser will only search for a \f[C]:\f[R] up to the
first \f[C]/\f[R] so if you need to act on a file or directory like this
then use the full path starting with a \f[C]/\f[R], or use \f[C]./\f[R]
as a current directory prefix.
.PP
So to sync a directory called \f[C]sync:me\f[R] to a remote called
\f[C]remote:\f[R] use
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync ./sync:me remote:path
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
or
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync /full/path/to/sync:me remote:path
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Server Side Copy
.PP
Most remotes (but not all \- see the
overview (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)) support
server side copy.
.PP
This means if you want to copy one folder to another then rclone
won\[cq]t download all the files and re\-upload them; it will instruct
the server to copy them in place.
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy s3:oldbucket s3:newbucket
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Will copy the contents of \f[C]oldbucket\f[R] to \f[C]newbucket\f[R]
without downloading and re\-uploading.
.PP
Remotes which don\[cq]t support server side copy \f[B]will\f[R] download
and re\-upload in this case.
.PP
Server side copies are used with \f[C]sync\f[R] and \f[C]copy\f[R] and
will be identified in the log when using the \f[C]\-v\f[R] flag.
The \f[C]move\f[R] command may also use them if remote doesn\[cq]t
support server side move directly.
This is done by issuing a server side copy then a delete which is much
quicker than a download and re\-upload.
.PP
Server side copies will only be attempted if the remote names are the
same.
.PP
This can be used when scripting to make aged backups efficiently, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync remote:current\-backup remote:previous\-backup
rclone sync /path/to/files remote:current\-backup
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Options
.PP
Rclone has a number of options to control its behaviour.
.PP
Options that take parameters can have the values passed in two ways,
\f[C]\-\-option=value\f[R] or \f[C]\-\-option value\f[R].
However boolean (true/false) options behave slightly differently to the
other options in that \f[C]\-\-boolean\f[R] sets the option to
\f[C]true\f[R] and the absence of the flag sets it to \f[C]false\f[R].
It is also possible to specify \f[C]\-\-boolean=false\f[R] or
\f[C]\-\-boolean=true\f[R].
Note that \f[C]\-\-boolean false\f[R] is not valid \- this is parsed as
\f[C]\-\-boolean\f[R] and the \f[C]false\f[R] is parsed as an extra
command line argument for rclone.
.PP
Options which use TIME use the go time parser.
A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each
with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as \[lq]300ms\[rq],
\[lq]\-1.5h\[rq] or \[lq]2h45m\[rq].
Valid time units are \[lq]ns\[rq], \[lq]us\[rq] (or \[lq]\[mc]s\[rq]),
\[lq]ms\[rq], \[lq]s\[rq], \[lq]m\[rq], \[lq]h\[rq].
.PP
Options which use SIZE use kByte by default.
However, a suffix of \f[C]b\f[R] for bytes, \f[C]k\f[R] for kBytes,
\f[C]M\f[R] for MBytes, \f[C]G\f[R] for GBytes, \f[C]T\f[R] for TBytes
and \f[C]P\f[R] for PBytes may be used.
These are the binary units, eg 1, 2**10, 2**20, 2**30 respectively.
.SS \[en]backup\-dir=DIR
.PP
When using \f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R] or \f[C]move\f[R] any files
which would have been overwritten or deleted are moved in their original
hierarchy into this directory.
.PP
If \f[C]\-\-suffix\f[R] is set, then the moved files will have the
suffix added to them.
If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has been added)
in DIR, then it will be overwritten.
.PP
The remote in use must support server side move or copy and you must use
the same remote as the destination of the sync.
The backup directory must not overlap the destination directory.
.PP
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync /path/to/local remote:current \-\-backup\-dir remote:old
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
will sync \f[C]/path/to/local\f[R] to \f[C]remote:current\f[R], but for
any files which would have been updated or deleted will be stored in
\f[C]remote:old\f[R].
.PP
If running rclone from a script you might want to use today\[cq]s date
as the directory name passed to \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir\f[R] to store the
old files, or you might want to pass \f[C]\-\-suffix\f[R] with
today\[cq]s date.
.PP
See \f[C]\-\-compare\-dest\f[R] and \f[C]\-\-copy\-dest\f[R].
.SS \[en]bind string
.PP
Local address to bind to for outgoing connections.
This can be an IPv4 address (1.2.3.4), an IPv6 address (1234::789A) or
host name.
If the host name doesn\[cq]t resolve or resolves to more than one IP
address it will give an error.
.SS \[en]bwlimit=BANDWIDTH_SPEC
.PP
This option controls the bandwidth limit.
Limits can be specified in two ways: As a single limit, or as a
timetable.
.PP
Single limits last for the duration of the session.
To use a single limit, specify the desired bandwidth in kBytes/s, or use
a suffix b|k|M|G.
The default is \f[C]0\f[R] which means to not limit bandwidth.
.PP
For example, to limit bandwidth usage to 10 MBytes/s use
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit 10M\f[R]
.PP
It is also possible to specify a \[lq]timetable\[rq] of limits, which
will cause certain limits to be applied at certain times.
To specify a timetable, format your entries as
\f[C]WEEKDAY\-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH WEEKDAY\-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH...\f[R] where:
\f[C]WEEKDAY\f[R] is optional element.
It could be written as whole world or only using 3 first characters.
\f[C]HH:MM\f[R] is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.
.PP
An example of a typical timetable to avoid link saturation during
daytime working hours could be:
.PP
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit \[dq]08:00,512 12:00,10M 13:00,512 18:00,30M 23:00,off\[dq]\f[R]
.PP
In this example, the transfer bandwidth will be every day set to
512kBytes/sec at 8am.
At noon, it will raise to 10Mbytes/s, and drop back to 512kBytes/sec at
1pm.
At 6pm, the bandwidth limit will be set to 30MBytes/s, and at 11pm it
will be completely disabled (full speed).
Anything between 11pm and 8am will remain unlimited.
.PP
An example of timetable with \f[C]WEEKDAY\f[R] could be:
.PP
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit \[dq]Mon\-00:00,512 Fri\-23:59,10M Sat\-10:00,1M Sun\-20:00,off\[dq]\f[R]
.PP
It mean that, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512kBytes/sec on
Monday.
It will raise to 10Mbytes/s before the end of Friday.
At 10:00 on Sunday it will be set to 1Mbyte/s.
From 20:00 at Sunday will be unlimited.
.PP
Timeslots without weekday are extended to whole week.
So this one example:
.PP
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit \[dq]Mon\-00:00,512 12:00,1M Sun\-20:00,off\[dq]\f[R]
.PP
Is equal to this:
.PP
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit \[dq]Mon\-00:00,512Mon\-12:00,1M Tue\-12:00,1M Wed\-12:00,1M Thu\-12:00,1M Fri\-12:00,1M Sat\-12:00,1M Sun\-12:00,1M Sun\-20:00,off\[dq]\f[R]
.PP
Bandwidth limits only apply to the data transfer.
They don\[cq]t apply to the bandwidth of the directory listings etc.
.PP
Note that the units are Bytes/s, not Bits/s.
Typically connections are measured in Bits/s \- to convert divide by 8.
For example, let\[cq]s say you have a 10 Mbit/s connection and you wish
rclone to use half of it \- 5 Mbit/s.
This is 5/8 = 0.625MByte/s so you would use a
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit 0.625M\f[R] parameter for rclone.
.PP
On Unix systems (Linux, macOS, \&...) the bandwidth limiter can be
toggled by sending a \f[C]SIGUSR2\f[R] signal to rclone.
This allows to remove the limitations of a long running rclone transfer
and to restore it back to the value specified with \f[C]\-\-bwlimit\f[R]
quickly when needed.
Assuming there is only one rclone instance running, you can toggle the
limiter like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill \-SIGUSR2 $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control (/rc) then you can use
change the bwlimit dynamically:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc core/bwlimit rate=1M
\f[R]
.fi
.SS \[en]buffer\-size=SIZE
.PP
Use this sized buffer to speed up file transfers.
Each \f[C]\-\-transfer\f[R] will use this much memory for buffering.
.PP
When using \f[C]mount\f[R] or \f[C]cmount\f[R] each open file descriptor
will use this much memory for buffering.
See the mount (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#file-buffering)
documentation for more details.
.PP
Set to \f[C]0\f[R] to disable the buffering for the minimum memory
usage.
.PP
Note that the memory allocation of the buffers is influenced by the
\[en]use\-mmap flag.
.SS \[en]check\-first
.PP
If this flag is set then in a \f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R] or
\f[C]move\f[R], rclone will do all the checks to see whether files need
to be transferred before doing any of the transfers.
Normally rclone would start running transfers as soon as possible.
.PP
This flag can be useful on IO limited systems where transfers interfere
with checking.
.PP
Using this flag can use more memory as it effectively sets
\f[C]\-\-max\-backlog\f[R] to infinite.
This means that all the info on the objects to transfer is held in
memory before the transfers start.
.SS \[en]checkers=N
.PP
The number of checkers to run in parallel.
Checkers do the equality checking of files during a sync.
For some storage systems (eg S3, Swift, Dropbox) this can take a
significant amount of time so they are run in parallel.
.PP
The default is to run 8 checkers in parallel.
.SS \-c, \[en]checksum
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check the file hash and size to
determine if files are equal.
.PP
This is useful when the remote doesn\[cq]t support setting modified time
and a more accurate sync is desired than just checking the file size.
.PP
This is very useful when transferring between remotes which store the
same hash type on the object, eg Drive and Swift.
For details of which remotes support which hash type see the table in
the overview section (https://rclone.org/overview/).
.PP
Eg \f[C]rclone \-\-checksum sync s3:/bucket swift:/bucket\f[R] would run
much quicker than without the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[R] flag.
.PP
When using this flag, rclone won\[cq]t update mtimes of remote files if
they are incorrect as it would normally.
.SS \[en]compare\-dest=DIR
.PP
When using \f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R] or \f[C]move\f[R] DIR is
checked in addition to the destination for files.
If a file identical to the source is found that file is NOT copied from
source.
This is useful to copy just files that have changed since the last
backup.
.PP
You must use the same remote as the destination of the sync.
The compare directory must not overlap the destination directory.
.PP
See \f[C]\-\-copy\-dest\f[R] and \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir\f[R].
.SS \[en]config=CONFIG_FILE
.PP
Specify the location of the rclone config file.
.PP
Normally the config file is in your home directory as a file called
\f[C].config/rclone/rclone.conf\f[R] (or \f[C].rclone.conf\f[R] if
created with an older version).
If \f[C]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\f[R] is set it will be at
\f[C]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rclone/rclone.conf\f[R].
.PP
If there is a file \f[C]rclone.conf\f[R] in the same directory as the
rclone executable it will be preferred.
This file must be created manually for Rclone to use it, it will never
be created automatically.
.PP
If you run \f[C]rclone config file\f[R] you will see where the default
location is for you.
.PP
Use this flag to override the config location, eg
\f[C]rclone \-\-config=\[dq].myconfig\[dq] .config\f[R].
.SS \[en]contimeout=TIME
.PP
Set the connection timeout.
This should be in go time format which looks like \f[C]5s\f[R] for 5
seconds, \f[C]10m\f[R] for 10 minutes, or \f[C]3h30m\f[R].
.PP
The connection timeout is the amount of time rclone will wait for a
connection to go through to a remote object storage system.
It is \f[C]1m\f[R] by default.
.SS \[en]copy\-dest=DIR
.PP
When using \f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R] or \f[C]move\f[R] DIR is
checked in addition to the destination for files.
If a file identical to the source is found that file is server side
copied from DIR to the destination.
This is useful for incremental backup.
.PP
The remote in use must support server side copy and you must use the
same remote as the destination of the sync.
The compare directory must not overlap the destination directory.
.PP
See \f[C]\-\-compare\-dest\f[R] and \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir\f[R].
.SS \[en]dedupe\-mode MODE
.PP
Mode to run dedupe command in.
One of \f[C]interactive\f[R], \f[C]skip\f[R], \f[C]first\f[R],
\f[C]newest\f[R], \f[C]oldest\f[R], \f[C]rename\f[R].
The default is \f[C]interactive\f[R].
See the dedupe command for more information as to what these options
mean.
.SS \[en]disable FEATURE,FEATURE,\&...
.PP
This disables a comma separated list of optional features.
For example to disable server side move and server side copy use:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-disable move,copy
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The features can be put in any case.
.PP
To see a list of which features can be disabled use:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-disable help
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
See the overview features (https://rclone.org/overview/#features) and
optional features (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) to
get an idea of which feature does what.
.PP
This flag can be useful for debugging and in exceptional circumstances
(eg Google Drive limiting the total volume of Server Side Copies to
100GB/day).
.SS \-n, \[en]dry\-run
.PP
Do a trial run with no permanent changes.
Use this to see what rclone would do without actually doing it.
Useful when setting up the \f[C]sync\f[R] command which deletes files in
the destination.
.SS \[en]expect\-continue\-timeout=TIME
.PP
This specifies the amount of time to wait for a server\[cq]s first
response headers after fully writing the request headers if the request
has an \[lq]Expect: 100\-continue\[rq] header.
Not all backends support using this.
.PP
Zero means no timeout and causes the body to be sent immediately,
without waiting for the server to approve.
This time does not include the time to send the request header.
.PP
The default is \f[C]1s\f[R].
Set to \f[C]0\f[R] to disable.
.SS \[en]error\-on\-no\-transfer
.PP
By default, rclone will exit with return code 0 if there were no errors.
.PP
This option allows rclone to return exit code 9 if no files were
transferred between the source and destination.
This allows using rclone in scripts, and triggering follow\-on actions
if data was copied, or skipping if not.
.PP
NB: Enabling this option turns a usually non\-fatal error into a
potentially fatal one \- please check and adjust your scripts
accordingly!
.SS \[en]header
.PP
Add an HTTP header for all transactions.
The flag can be repeated to add multiple headers.
.PP
If you want to add headers only for uploads use
\f[C]\-\-header\-upload\f[R] and if you want to add headers only for
downloads use \f[C]\-\-header\-download\f[R].
.PP
This flag is supported for all HTTP based backends even those not
supported by \f[C]\-\-header\-upload\f[R] and
\f[C]\-\-header\-download\f[R] so may be used as a workaround for those
with care.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone ls remote:test \-\-header \[dq]X\-Rclone: Foo\[dq] \-\-header \[dq]X\-LetMeIn: Yes\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.SS \[en]header\-download
.PP
Add an HTTP header for all download transactions.
The flag can be repeated to add multiple headers.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync s3:test/src \[ti]/dst \-\-header\-download \[dq]X\-Amz\-Meta\-Test: Foo\[dq] \-\-header\-download \[dq]X\-Amz\-Meta\-Test2: Bar\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
See the GitHub issue here (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/59)
for currently supported backends.
.SS \[en]header\-upload
.PP
Add an HTTP header for all upload transactions.
The flag can be repeated to add multiple headers.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync \[ti]/src s3:test/dst \-\-header\-upload \[dq]Content\-Disposition: attachment; filename=\[aq]cool.html\[aq]\[dq] \-\-header\-upload \[dq]X\-Amz\-Meta\-Test: FooBar\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
See the GitHub issue here (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/59)
for currently supported backends.
.SS \[en]ignore\-case\-sync
.PP
Using this option will cause rclone to ignore the case of the files when
synchronizing so files will not be copied/synced when the existing
filenames are the same, even if the casing is different.
.SS \[en]ignore\-checksum
.PP
Normally rclone will check that the checksums of transferred files
match, and give an error \[lq]corrupted on transfer\[rq] if they
don\[cq]t.
.PP
You can use this option to skip that check.
You should only use it if you have had the \[lq]corrupted on
transfer\[rq] error message and you are sure you might want to transfer
potentially corrupted data.
.SS \[en]ignore\-existing
.PP
Using this option will make rclone unconditionally skip all files that
exist on the destination, no matter the content of these files.
.PP
While this isn\[cq]t a generally recommended option, it can be useful in
cases where your files change due to encryption.
However, it cannot correct partial transfers in case a transfer was
interrupted.
.SS \[en]ignore\-size
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check only the modification time.
If \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[R] is set then it only checks the checksum.
.PP
It will also cause rclone to skip verifying the sizes are the same after
transfer.
.PP
This can be useful for transferring files to and from OneDrive which
occasionally misreports the size of image files (see
#399 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/399) for more info).
.SS \-I, \[en]ignore\-times
.PP
Using this option will cause rclone to unconditionally upload all files
regardless of the state of files on the destination.
.PP
Normally rclone would skip any files that have the same modification
time and are the same size (or have the same checksum if using
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[R]).
.SS \[en]immutable
.PP
Treat source and destination files as immutable and disallow
modification.
.PP
With this option set, files will be created and deleted as requested,
but existing files will never be updated.
If an existing file does not match between the source and destination,
rclone will give the error
\f[C]Source and destination exist but do not match: immutable file modified\f[R].
.PP
Note that only commands which transfer files (e.g.\ \f[C]sync\f[R],
\f[C]copy\f[R], \f[C]move\f[R]) are affected by this behavior, and only
modification is disallowed.
Files may still be deleted explicitly (e.g.\ \f[C]delete\f[R],
\f[C]purge\f[R]) or implicitly (e.g.\ \f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]move\f[R]).
Use \f[C]copy \-\-immutable\f[R] if it is desired to avoid deletion as
well as modification.
.PP
This can be useful as an additional layer of protection for immutable or
append\-only data sets (notably backup archives), where modification
implies corruption and should not be propagated.
.SS \[en]leave\-root
.PP
During rmdirs it will not remove root directory, even if it\[cq]s empty.
.SS \[en]log\-file=FILE
.PP
Log all of rclone\[cq]s output to FILE.
This is not active by default.
This can be useful for tracking down problems with syncs in combination
with the \f[C]\-v\f[R] flag.
See the Logging section for more info.
.PP
Note that if you are using the \f[C]logrotate\f[R] program to manage
rclone\[cq]s logs, then you should use the \f[C]copytruncate\f[R] option
as rclone doesn\[cq]t have a signal to rotate logs.
.SS \[en]log\-format LIST
.PP
Comma separated list of log format options.
\f[C]date\f[R], \f[C]time\f[R], \f[C]microseconds\f[R],
\f[C]longfile\f[R], \f[C]shortfile\f[R], \f[C]UTC\f[R].
The default is \[lq]\f[C]date\f[R],\f[C]time\f[R]\[rq].
.SS \[en]log\-level LEVEL
.PP
This sets the log level for rclone.
The default log level is \f[C]NOTICE\f[R].
.PP
\f[C]DEBUG\f[R] is equivalent to \f[C]\-vv\f[R].
It outputs lots of debug info \- useful for bug reports and really
finding out what rclone is doing.
.PP
\f[C]INFO\f[R] is equivalent to \f[C]\-v\f[R].
It outputs information about each transfer and prints stats once a
minute by default.
.PP
\f[C]NOTICE\f[R] is the default log level if no logging flags are
supplied.
It outputs very little when things are working normally.
It outputs warnings and significant events.
.PP
\f[C]ERROR\f[R] is equivalent to \f[C]\-q\f[R].
It only outputs error messages.
.SS \[en]use\-json\-log
.PP
This switches the log format to JSON for rclone.
The fields of json log are level, msg, source, time.
.SS \[en]low\-level\-retries NUMBER
.PP
This controls the number of low level retries rclone does.
.PP
A low level retry is used to retry a failing operation \- typically one
HTTP request.
This might be uploading a chunk of a big file for example.
You will see low level retries in the log with the \f[C]\-v\f[R] flag.
.PP
This shouldn\[cq]t need to be changed from the default in normal
operations.
However, if you get a lot of low level retries you may wish to reduce
the value so rclone moves on to a high level retry (see the
\f[C]\-\-retries\f[R] flag) quicker.
.PP
Disable low level retries with \f[C]\-\-low\-level\-retries 1\f[R].
.SS \[en]max\-backlog=N
.PP
This is the maximum allowable backlog of files in a sync/copy/move
queued for being checked or transferred.
.PP
This can be set arbitrarily large.
It will only use memory when the queue is in use.
Note that it will use in the order of N kB of memory when the backlog is
in use.
.PP
Setting this large allows rclone to calculate how many files are pending
more accurately, give a more accurate estimated finish time and make
\f[C]\-\-order\-by\f[R] work more accurately.
.PP
Setting this small will make rclone more synchronous to the listings of
the remote which may be desirable.
.PP
Setting this to a negative number will make the backlog as large as
possible.
.SS \[en]max\-delete=N
.PP
This tells rclone not to delete more than N files.
If that limit is exceeded then a fatal error will be generated and
rclone will stop the operation in progress.
.SS \[en]max\-depth=N
.PP
This modifies the recursion depth for all the commands except purge.
.PP
So if you do \f[C]rclone \-\-max\-depth 1 ls remote:path\f[R] you will
see only the files in the top level directory.
Using \f[C]\-\-max\-depth 2\f[R] means you will see all the files in
first two directory levels and so on.
.PP
For historical reasons the \f[C]lsd\f[R] command defaults to using a
\f[C]\-\-max\-depth\f[R] of 1 \- you can override this with the command
line flag.
.PP
You can use this command to disable recursion (with
\f[C]\-\-max\-depth 1\f[R]).
.PP
Note that if you use this with \f[C]sync\f[R] and
\f[C]\-\-delete\-excluded\f[R] the files not recursed through are
considered excluded and will be deleted on the destination.
Test first with \f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[R] if you are not sure what will
happen.
.SS \[en]max\-duration=TIME
.PP
Rclone will stop scheduling new transfers when it has run for the
duration specified.
.PP
Defaults to off.
.PP
When the limit is reached any existing transfers will complete.
.PP
Rclone won\[cq]t exit with an error if the transfer limit is reached.
.SS \[en]max\-transfer=SIZE
.PP
Rclone will stop transferring when it has reached the size specified.
Defaults to off.
.PP
When the limit is reached all transfers will stop immediately.
.PP
Rclone will exit with exit code 8 if the transfer limit is reached.
.SS \[en]cutoff\-mode=hard|soft|cautious
.PP
This modifies the behavior of \f[C]\-\-max\-transfer\f[R] Defaults to
\f[C]\-\-cutoff\-mode=hard\f[R].
.PP
Specifying \f[C]\-\-cutoff\-mode=hard\f[R] will stop transferring
immediately when Rclone reaches the limit.
.PP
Specifying \f[C]\-\-cutoff\-mode=soft\f[R] will stop starting new
transfers when Rclone reaches the limit.
.PP
Specifying \f[C]\-\-cutoff\-mode=cautious\f[R] will try to prevent
Rclone from reaching the limit.
.SS \[en]modify\-window=TIME
.PP
When checking whether a file has been modified, this is the maximum
allowed time difference that a file can have and still be considered
equivalent.
.PP
The default is \f[C]1ns\f[R] unless this is overridden by a remote.
For example OS X only stores modification times to the nearest second so
if you are reading and writing to an OS X filing system this will be
\f[C]1s\f[R] by default.
.PP
This command line flag allows you to override that computed default.
.SS \[en]multi\-thread\-cutoff=SIZE
.PP
When downloading files to the local backend above this size, rclone will
use multiple threads to download the file (default 250M).
.PP
Rclone preallocates the file (using
\f[C]fallocate(FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE)\f[R] on unix or
\f[C]NTSetInformationFile\f[R] on Windows both of which takes no time)
then each thread writes directly into the file at the correct place.
This means that rclone won\[cq]t create fragmented or sparse files and
there won\[cq]t be any assembly time at the end of the transfer.
.PP
The number of threads used to download is controlled by
\f[C]\-\-multi\-thread\-streams\f[R].
.PP
Use \f[C]\-vv\f[R] if you wish to see info about the threads.
.PP
This will work with the \f[C]sync\f[R]/\f[C]copy\f[R]/\f[C]move\f[R]
commands and friends \f[C]copyto\f[R]/\f[C]moveto\f[R].
Multi thread downloads will be used with \f[C]rclone mount\f[R] and
\f[C]rclone serve\f[R] if \f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode\f[R] is set to
\f[C]writes\f[R] or above.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] that this \f[B]only\f[R] works for a local destination but
will work with any source.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] that multi thread copies are disabled for local to local
copies as they are faster without unless
\f[C]\-\-multi\-thread\-streams\f[R] is set explicitly.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] on Windows using multi\-thread downloads will cause the
resulting files to be
sparse (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file).
Use \f[C]\-\-local\-no\-sparse\f[R] to disable sparse files (which may
cause long delays at the start of downloads) or disable multi\-thread
downloads with \f[C]\-\-multi\-thread\-streams 0\f[R]
.SS \[en]multi\-thread\-streams=N
.PP
When using multi thread downloads (see above
\f[C]\-\-multi\-thread\-cutoff\f[R]) this sets the maximum number of
streams to use.
Set to \f[C]0\f[R] to disable multi thread downloads (Default 4).
.PP
Exactly how many streams rclone uses for the download depends on the
size of the file.
To calculate the number of download streams Rclone divides the size of
the file by the \f[C]\-\-multi\-thread\-cutoff\f[R] and rounds up, up to
the maximum set with \f[C]\-\-multi\-thread\-streams\f[R].
.PP
So if \f[C]\-\-multi\-thread\-cutoff 250MB\f[R] and
\f[C]\-\-multi\-thread\-streams 4\f[R] are in effect (the defaults):
.IP \[bu] 2
0MB..250MB files will be downloaded with 1 stream
.IP \[bu] 2
250MB..500MB files will be downloaded with 2 streams
.IP \[bu] 2
500MB..750MB files will be downloaded with 3 streams
.IP \[bu] 2
750MB+ files will be downloaded with 4 streams
.SS \[en]no\-check\-dest
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-no\-check\-dest\f[R] can be used with \f[C]move\f[R] or
\f[C]copy\f[R] and it causes rclone not to check the destination at all
when copying files.
.PP
This means that:
.IP \[bu] 2
the destination is not listed minimising the API calls
.IP \[bu] 2
files are always transferred
.IP \[bu] 2
this can cause duplicates on remotes which allow it (eg Google Drive)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-retries 1\f[R] is recommended otherwise you\[cq]ll transfer
everything again on a retry
.PP
This flag is useful to minimise the transactions if you know that none
of the files are on the destination.
.PP
This is a specialized flag which should be ignored by most users!
.SS \[en]no\-gzip\-encoding
.PP
Don\[cq]t set \f[C]Accept\-Encoding: gzip\f[R].
This means that rclone won\[cq]t ask the server for compressed files
automatically.
Useful if you\[cq]ve set the server to return files with
\f[C]Content\-Encoding: gzip\f[R] but you uploaded compressed files.
.PP
There is no need to set this in normal operation, and doing so will
decrease the network transfer efficiency of rclone.
.SS \[en]no\-traverse
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[R] flag controls whether the destination
file system is traversed when using the \f[C]copy\f[R] or \f[C]move\f[R]
commands.
\f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[R] is not compatible with \f[C]sync\f[R] and
will be ignored if you supply it with \f[C]sync\f[R].
.PP
If you are only copying a small number of files (or are filtering most
of the files) and/or have a large number of files on the destination
then \f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[R] will stop rclone listing the destination
and save time.
.PP
However, if you are copying a large number of files, especially if you
are doing a copy where lots of the files under consideration haven\[cq]t
changed and won\[cq]t need copying then you shouldn\[cq]t use
\f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[R].
.PP
See rclone copy (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) for an
example of how to use it.
.SS \[en]no\-unicode\-normalization
.PP
Don\[cq]t normalize unicode characters in filenames during the sync
routine.
.PP
Sometimes, an operating system will store filenames containing unicode
parts in their decomposed form (particularly macOS).
Some cloud storage systems will then recompose the unicode, resulting in
duplicate files if the data is ever copied back to a local filesystem.
.PP
Using this flag will disable that functionality, treating each unicode
character as unique.
For example, by default e\[u0301] and \['e] will be normalized into the
same character.
With \f[C]\-\-no\-unicode\-normalization\f[R] they will be treated as
unique characters.
.SS \[en]no\-update\-modtime
.PP
When using this flag, rclone won\[cq]t update modification times of
remote files if they are incorrect as it would normally.
.PP
This can be used if the remote is being synced with another tool also
(eg the Google Drive client).
.SS \[en]order\-by string
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-order\-by\f[R] flag controls the order in which files in
the backlog are processed in \f[C]rclone sync\f[R],
\f[C]rclone copy\f[R] and \f[C]rclone move\f[R].
.PP
The order by string is constructed like this.
The first part describes what aspect is being measured:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]size\f[R] \- order by the size of the files
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]name\f[R] \- order by the full path of the files
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]modtime\f[R] \- order by the modification date of the files
.PP
This can have a modifier appended with a comma:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]ascending\f[R] or \f[C]asc\f[R] \- order so that the smallest (or
oldest) is processed first
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]descending\f[R] or \f[C]desc\f[R] \- order so that the largest (or
newest) is processed first
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]mixed\f[R] \- order so that the smallest is processed first for
some threads and the largest for others
.PP
If the modifier is \f[C]mixed\f[R] then it can have an optional
percentage (which defaults to \f[C]50\f[R]), eg \f[C]size,mixed,25\f[R]
which means that 25% of the threads should be taking the smallest items
and 75% the largest.
The threads which take the smallest first will always take the smallest
first and likewise the largest first threads.
The \f[C]mixed\f[R] mode can be useful to minimise the transfer time
when you are transferring a mixture of large and small files \- the
large files are guaranteed upload threads and bandwidth and the small
files will be processed continuously.
.PP
If no modifier is supplied then the order is \f[C]ascending\f[R].
.PP
For example
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-order\-by size,desc\f[R] \- send the largest files first
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-order\-by modtime,ascending\f[R] \- send the oldest files first
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-order\-by name\f[R] \- send the files with alphabetically by
path first
.PP
If the \f[C]\-\-order\-by\f[R] flag is not supplied or it is supplied
with an empty string then the default ordering will be used which is as
scanned.
With \f[C]\-\-checkers 1\f[R] this is mostly alphabetical, however with
the default \f[C]\-\-checkers 8\f[R] it is somewhat random.
.SS Limitations
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-order\-by\f[R] flag does not do a separate pass over the
data.
This means that it may transfer some files out of the order specified if
.IP \[bu] 2
there are no files in the backlog or the source has not been fully
scanned yet
.IP \[bu] 2
there are more than \[en]max\-backlog files in the backlog
.PP
Rclone will do its best to transfer the best file it has so in practice
this should not cause a problem.
Think of \f[C]\-\-order\-by\f[R] as being more of a best efforts flag
rather than a perfect ordering.
.SS \[en]password\-command SpaceSepList
.PP
This flag supplies a program which should supply the config password
when run.
This is an alternative to rclone prompting for the password or setting
the \f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[R] variable.
.PP
The argument to this should be a command with a space separated list of
arguments.
If one of the arguments has a space in then enclose it in
\f[C]\[dq]\f[R], if you want a literal \f[C]\[dq]\f[R] in an argument
then enclose the argument in \f[C]\[dq]\f[R] and double the
\f[C]\[dq]\f[R].
See CSV encoding (https://godoc.org/encoding/csv) for more info.
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-password\-command echo hello
\-\-password\-command echo \[dq]hello with space\[dq]
\-\-password\-command echo \[dq]hello with \[dq]\[dq]quotes\[dq]\[dq] and space\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
See the Configuration Encryption for more info.
.PP
See a Windows PowerShell example on the
Wiki (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/wiki/Windows-Powershell-use-rclone-password-command-for-Config-file-password).
.SS \-P, \[en]progress
.PP
This flag makes rclone update the stats in a static block in the
terminal providing a realtime overview of the transfer.
.PP
Any log messages will scroll above the static block.
Log messages will push the static block down to the bottom of the
terminal where it will stay.
.PP
Normally this is updated every 500mS but this period can be overridden
with the \f[C]\-\-stats\f[R] flag.
.PP
This can be used with the \f[C]\-\-stats\-one\-line\f[R] flag for a
simpler display.
.PP
Note: On Windows until this
bug (https://github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm/issues/26) is fixed all
non\-ASCII characters will be replaced with \f[C].\f[R] when
\f[C]\-\-progress\f[R] is in use.
.SS \-q, \[en]quiet
.PP
This flag will limit rclone\[cq]s output to error messages only.
.SS \[en]retries int
.PP
Retry the entire sync if it fails this many times it fails (default 3).
.PP
Some remotes can be unreliable and a few retries help pick up the files
which didn\[cq]t get transferred because of errors.
.PP
Disable retries with \f[C]\-\-retries 1\f[R].
.SS \[en]retries\-sleep=TIME
.PP
This sets the interval between each retry specified by
\f[C]\-\-retries\f[R]
.PP
The default is \f[C]0\f[R].
Use \f[C]0\f[R] to disable.
.SS \[en]size\-only
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check only the size.
.PP
This can be useful transferring files from Dropbox which have been
modified by the desktop sync client which doesn\[cq]t set checksums of
modification times in the same way as rclone.
.SS \[en]stats=TIME
.PP
Commands which transfer data (\f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R],
\f[C]copyto\f[R], \f[C]move\f[R], \f[C]moveto\f[R]) will print data
transfer stats at regular intervals to show their progress.
.PP
This sets the interval.
.PP
The default is \f[C]1m\f[R].
Use \f[C]0\f[R] to disable.
.PP
If you set the stats interval then all commands can show stats.
This can be useful when running other commands, \f[C]check\f[R] or
\f[C]mount\f[R] for example.
.PP
Stats are logged at \f[C]INFO\f[R] level by default which means they
won\[cq]t show at default log level \f[C]NOTICE\f[R].
Use \f[C]\-\-stats\-log\-level NOTICE\f[R] or \f[C]\-v\f[R] to make them
show.
See the Logging section for more info on log levels.
.PP
Note that on macOS you can send a SIGINFO (which is normally ctrl\-T in
the terminal) to make the stats print immediately.
.SS \[en]stats\-file\-name\-length integer
.PP
By default, the \f[C]\-\-stats\f[R] output will truncate file names and
paths longer than 40 characters.
This is equivalent to providing
\f[C]\-\-stats\-file\-name\-length 40\f[R].
Use \f[C]\-\-stats\-file\-name\-length 0\f[R] to disable any truncation
of file names printed by stats.
.SS \[en]stats\-log\-level string
.PP
Log level to show \f[C]\-\-stats\f[R] output at.
This can be \f[C]DEBUG\f[R], \f[C]INFO\f[R], \f[C]NOTICE\f[R], or
\f[C]ERROR\f[R].
The default is \f[C]INFO\f[R].
This means at the default level of logging which is \f[C]NOTICE\f[R] the
stats won\[cq]t show \- if you want them to then use
\f[C]\-\-stats\-log\-level NOTICE\f[R].
See the Logging section for more info on log levels.
.SS \[en]stats\-one\-line
.PP
When this is specified, rclone condenses the stats into a single line
showing the most important stats only.
.SS \[en]stats\-one\-line\-date
.PP
When this is specified, rclone enables the single\-line stats and
prepends the display with a date string.
The default is \f[C]2006/01/02 15:04:05 \-\f[R]
.SS \[en]stats\-one\-line\-date\-format
.PP
When this is specified, rclone enables the single\-line stats and
prepends the display with a user\-supplied date string.
The date string MUST be enclosed in quotes.
Follow golang specs (https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Format) for date
formatting syntax.
.SS \[en]stats\-unit=bits|bytes
.PP
By default, data transfer rates will be printed in bytes/second.
.PP
This option allows the data rate to be printed in bits/second.
.PP
Data transfer volume will still be reported in bytes.
.PP
The rate is reported as a binary unit, not SI unit.
So 1 Mbit/s equals 1,048,576 bits/s and not 1,000,000 bits/s.
.PP
The default is \f[C]bytes\f[R].
.SS \[en]suffix=SUFFIX
.PP
When using \f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R] or \f[C]move\f[R] any files
which would have been overwritten or deleted will have the suffix added
to them.
If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has been added),
then it will be overwritten.
.PP
The remote in use must support server side move or copy and you must use
the same remote as the destination of the sync.
.PP
This is for use with files to add the suffix in the current directory or
with \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir\f[R].
See \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir\f[R] for more info.
.PP
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync /path/to/local/file remote:current \-\-suffix .bak
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
will sync \f[C]/path/to/local\f[R] to \f[C]remote:current\f[R], but for
any files which would have been updated or deleted have .bak added.
.SS \[en]suffix\-keep\-extension
.PP
When using \f[C]\-\-suffix\f[R], setting this causes rclone put the
SUFFIX before the extension of the files that it backs up rather than
after.
.PP
So let\[cq]s say we had \f[C]\-\-suffix \-2019\-01\-01\f[R], without the
flag \f[C]file.txt\f[R] would be backed up to
\f[C]file.txt\-2019\-01\-01\f[R] and with the flag it would be backed up
to \f[C]file\-2019\-01\-01.txt\f[R].
This can be helpful to make sure the suffixed files can still be opened.
.SS \[en]syslog
.PP
On capable OSes (not Windows or Plan9) send all log output to syslog.
.PP
This can be useful for running rclone in a script or
\f[C]rclone mount\f[R].
.SS \[en]syslog\-facility string
.PP
If using \f[C]\-\-syslog\f[R] this sets the syslog facility (eg
\f[C]KERN\f[R], \f[C]USER\f[R]).
See \f[C]man syslog\f[R] for a list of possible facilities.
The default facility is \f[C]DAEMON\f[R].
.SS \[en]tpslimit float
.PP
Limit HTTP transactions per second to this.
Default is 0 which is used to mean unlimited transactions per second.
.PP
For example to limit rclone to 10 HTTP transactions per second use
\f[C]\-\-tpslimit 10\f[R], or to 1 transaction every 2 seconds use
\f[C]\-\-tpslimit 0.5\f[R].
.PP
Use this when the number of transactions per second from rclone is
causing a problem with the cloud storage provider (eg getting you banned
or rate limited).
.PP
This can be very useful for \f[C]rclone mount\f[R] to control the
behaviour of applications using it.
.PP
See also \f[C]\-\-tpslimit\-burst\f[R].
.SS \[en]tpslimit\-burst int
.PP
Max burst of transactions for \f[C]\-\-tpslimit\f[R] (default
\f[C]1\f[R]).
.PP
Normally \f[C]\-\-tpslimit\f[R] will do exactly the number of
transaction per second specified.
However if you supply \f[C]\-\-tps\-burst\f[R] then rclone can save up
some transactions from when it was idle giving a burst of up to the
parameter supplied.
.PP
For example if you provide \f[C]\-\-tpslimit\-burst 10\f[R] then if
rclone has been idle for more than 10*\f[C]\-\-tpslimit\f[R] then it can
do 10 transactions very quickly before they are limited again.
.PP
This may be used to increase performance of \f[C]\-\-tpslimit\f[R]
without changing the long term average number of transactions per
second.
.SS \[en]track\-renames
.PP
By default, rclone doesn\[cq]t keep track of renamed files, so if you
rename a file locally then sync it to a remote, rclone will delete the
old file on the remote and upload a new copy.
.PP
If you use this flag, and the remote supports server side copy or server
side move, and the source and destination have a compatible hash, then
this will track renames during \f[C]sync\f[R] operations and perform
renaming server\-side.
.PP
Files will be matched by size and hash \- if both match then a rename
will be considered.
.PP
If the destination does not support server\-side copy or move, rclone
will fall back to the default behaviour and log an error level message
to the console.
Note: Encrypted destinations are not supported by
\f[C]\-\-track\-renames\f[R].
.PP
Note that \f[C]\-\-track\-renames\f[R] is incompatible with
\f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[R] and that it uses extra memory to keep track
of all the rename candidates.
.PP
Note also that \f[C]\-\-track\-renames\f[R] is incompatible with
\f[C]\-\-delete\-before\f[R] and will select \f[C]\-\-delete\-after\f[R]
instead of \f[C]\-\-delete\-during\f[R].
.SS \[en]track\-renames\-strategy (hash,modtime)
.PP
This option changes the matching criteria for
\f[C]\-\-track\-renames\f[R] to match by any combination of modtime,
hash, size.
Matching by size is always enabled no matter what option is selected
here.
This also means that it enables \f[C]\-\-track\-renames\f[R] support for
encrypted destinations.
If nothing is specified, the default option is matching by hashes.
.SS \[en]delete\-(before,during,after)
.PP
This option allows you to specify when files on your destination are
deleted when you sync folders.
.PP
Specifying the value \f[C]\-\-delete\-before\f[R] will delete all files
present on the destination, but not on the source \f[I]before\f[R]
starting the transfer of any new or updated files.
This uses two passes through the file systems, one for the deletions and
one for the copies.
.PP
Specifying \f[C]\-\-delete\-during\f[R] will delete files while checking
and uploading files.
This is the fastest option and uses the least memory.
.PP
Specifying \f[C]\-\-delete\-after\f[R] (the default value) will delay
deletion of files until all new/updated files have been successfully
transferred.
The files to be deleted are collected in the copy pass then deleted
after the copy pass has completed successfully.
The files to be deleted are held in memory so this mode may use more
memory.
This is the safest mode as it will only delete files if there have been
no errors subsequent to that.
If there have been errors before the deletions start then you will get
the message \f[C]not deleting files as there were IO errors\f[R].
.SS \[en]fast\-list
.PP
When doing anything which involves a directory listing (eg
\f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R], \f[C]ls\f[R] \- in fact nearly every
command), rclone normally lists a directory and processes it before
using more directory lists to process any subdirectories.
This can be parallelised and works very quickly using the least amount
of memory.
.PP
However, some remotes have a way of listing all files beneath a
directory in one (or a small number) of transactions.
These tend to be the bucket based remotes (eg S3, B2, GCS, Swift,
Hubic).
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R] flag then rclone will use this
method for listing directories.
This will have the following consequences for the listing:
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[B]will\f[R] use fewer transactions (important if you pay for them)
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[B]will\f[R] use more memory.
Rclone has to load the whole listing into memory.
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[I]may\f[R] be faster because it uses fewer transactions
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[I]may\f[R] be slower because it can\[cq]t be parallelized
.PP
rclone should always give identical results with and without
\f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R].
.PP
If you pay for transactions and can fit your entire sync listing into
memory then \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R] is recommended.
If you have a very big sync to do then don\[cq]t use
\f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R] otherwise you will run out of memory.
.PP
If you use \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R] on a remote which doesn\[cq]t
support it, then rclone will just ignore it.
.SS \[en]timeout=TIME
.PP
This sets the IO idle timeout.
If a transfer has started but then becomes idle for this long it is
considered broken and disconnected.
.PP
The default is \f[C]5m\f[R].
Set to \f[C]0\f[R] to disable.
.SS \[en]transfers=N
.PP
The number of file transfers to run in parallel.
It can sometimes be useful to set this to a smaller number if the remote
is giving a lot of timeouts or bigger if you have lots of bandwidth and
a fast remote.
.PP
The default is to run 4 file transfers in parallel.
.SS \-u, \[en]update
.PP
This forces rclone to skip any files which exist on the destination and
have a modified time that is newer than the source file.
.PP
This can be useful when transferring to a remote which doesn\[cq]t
support mod times directly (or when using
\f[C]\-\-use\-server\-modtime\f[R] to avoid extra API calls) as it is
more accurate than a \f[C]\-\-size\-only\f[R] check and faster than
using \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[R].
.PP
If an existing destination file has a modification time equal (within
the computed modify window precision) to the source file\[cq]s, it will
be updated if the sizes are different.
If \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[R] is set then rclone will update the destination
if the checksums differ too.
.PP
If an existing destination file is older than the source file then it
will be updated if the size or checksum differs from the source file.
.PP
On remotes which don\[cq]t support mod time directly (or when using
\f[C]\-\-use\-server\-modtime\f[R]) the time checked will be the
uploaded time.
This means that if uploading to one of these remotes, rclone will skip
any files which exist on the destination and have an uploaded time that
is newer than the modification time of the source file.
.SS \[en]use\-mmap
.PP
If this flag is set then rclone will use anonymous memory allocated by
mmap on Unix based platforms and VirtualAlloc on Windows for its
transfer buffers (size controlled by \f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\f[R]).
Memory allocated like this does not go on the Go heap and can be
returned to the OS immediately when it is finished with.
.PP
If this flag is not set then rclone will allocate and free the buffers
using the Go memory allocator which may use more memory as memory pages
are returned less aggressively to the OS.
.PP
It is possible this does not work well on all platforms so it is
disabled by default; in the future it may be enabled by default.
.SS \[en]use\-server\-modtime
.PP
Some object\-store backends (e.g, Swift, S3) do not preserve file
modification times (modtime).
On these backends, rclone stores the original modtime as additional
metadata on the object.
By default it will make an API call to retrieve the metadata when the
modtime is needed by an operation.
.PP
Use this flag to disable the extra API call and rely instead on the
server\[cq]s modified time.
In cases such as a local to remote sync using \f[C]\-\-update\f[R],
knowing the local file is newer than the time it was last uploaded to
the remote is sufficient.
In those cases, this flag can speed up the process and reduce the number
of API calls necessary.
.PP
Using this flag on a sync operation without also using
\f[C]\-\-update\f[R] would cause all files modified at any time other
than the last upload time to be uploaded again, which is probably not
what you want.
.SS \-v, \-vv, \[en]verbose
.PP
With \f[C]\-v\f[R] rclone will tell you about each file that is
transferred and a small number of significant events.
.PP
With \f[C]\-vv\f[R] rclone will become very verbose telling you about
every file it considers and transfers.
Please send bug reports with a log with this setting.
.SS \-V, \[en]version
.PP
Prints the version number
.SS SSL/TLS options
.PP
The outgoing SSL/TLS connections rclone makes can be controlled with
these options.
For example this can be very useful with the HTTP or WebDAV backends.
Rclone HTTP servers have their own set of configuration for SSL/TLS
which you can find in their documentation.
.SS \[en]ca\-cert string
.PP
This loads the PEM encoded certificate authority certificate and uses it
to verify the certificates of the servers rclone connects to.
.PP
If you have generated certificates signed with a local CA then you will
need this flag to connect to servers using those certificates.
.SS \[en]client\-cert string
.PP
This loads the PEM encoded client side certificate.
.PP
This is used for mutual TLS
authentication (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication).
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-client\-key\f[R] flag is required too when using this.
.SS \[en]client\-key string
.PP
This loads the PEM encoded client side private key used for mutual TLS
authentication.
Used in conjunction with \f[C]\-\-client\-cert\f[R].
.SS \[en]no\-check\-certificate=true/false
.PP
\f[C]\-\-no\-check\-certificate\f[R] controls whether a client verifies
the server\[cq]s certificate chain and host name.
If \f[C]\-\-no\-check\-certificate\f[R] is true, TLS accepts any
certificate presented by the server and any host name in that
certificate.
In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man\-in\-the\-middle attacks.
.PP
This option defaults to \f[C]false\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]This should be used only for testing.\f[R]
.SS Configuration Encryption
.PP
Your configuration file contains information for logging in to your
cloud services.
This means that you should keep your \f[C].rclone.conf\f[R] file in a
secure location.
.PP
If you are in an environment where that isn\[cq]t possible, you can add
a password to your configuration.
This means that you will have to supply the password every time you
start rclone.
.PP
To add a password to your rclone configuration, execute
\f[C]rclone config\f[R].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
>rclone config
Current remotes:

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/s/q>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Go into \f[C]s\f[R], Set configuration password:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
e/n/d/s/q> s
Your configuration is not encrypted.
If you add a password, you will protect your login information to cloud services.
a) Add Password
q) Quit to main menu
a/q> a
Enter NEW configuration password:
password:
Confirm NEW password:
password:
Password set
Your configuration is encrypted.
c) Change Password
u) Unencrypt configuration
q) Quit to main menu
c/u/q>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Your configuration is now encrypted, and every time you start rclone you
will have to supply the password.
See below for details.
In the same menu, you can change the password or completely remove
encryption from your configuration.
.PP
There is no way to recover the configuration if you lose your password.
.PP
rclone uses nacl
secretbox (https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox) which
in turn uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate your
configuration with secret\-key cryptography.
The password is SHA\-256 hashed, which produces the key for secretbox.
The hashed password is not stored.
.PP
While this provides very good security, we do not recommend storing your
encrypted rclone configuration in public if it contains sensitive
information, maybe except if you use a very strong password.
.PP
If it is safe in your environment, you can set the
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[R] environment variable to contain your
password, in which case it will be used for decrypting the
configuration.
.PP
You can set this for a session from a script.
For unix like systems save this to a file called
\f[C]set\-rclone\-password\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#!/bin/echo Source this file don\[aq]t run it

read \-s RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
export RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then source the file when you want to use it.
From the shell you would do \f[C]source set\-rclone\-password\f[R].
It will then ask you for the password and set it in the environment
variable.
.PP
An alternate means of supplying the password is to provide a script
which will retrieve the password and print on standard output.
This script should have a fully specified path name and not rely on any
environment variables.
The script is supplied either via
\f[C]\-\-password\-command=\[dq]...\[dq]\f[R] command line argument or
via the \f[C]RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND\f[R] environment variable.
.PP
One useful example of this is using the \f[C]passwordstore\f[R]
application to retrieve the password:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND=\[dq]pass rclone/config\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If the \f[C]passwordstore\f[R] password manager holds the password for
the rclone configuration, using the script method means the password is
primarily protected by the \f[C]passwordstore\f[R] system, and is never
embedded in the clear in scripts, nor available for examination using
the standard commands available.
It is quite possible with long running rclone sessions for copies of
passwords to be innocently captured in log files or terminal scroll
buffers, etc.
Using the script method of supplying the password enhances the security
of the config password considerably.
.PP
If you are running rclone inside a script, unless you are using the
\f[C]\-\-password\-command\f[R] method, you might want to disable
password prompts.
To do that, pass the parameter \f[C]\-\-ask\-password=false\f[R] to
rclone.
This will make rclone fail instead of asking for a password if
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[R] doesn\[cq]t contain a valid password, and
\f[C]\-\-password\-command\f[R] has not been supplied.
.SS Developer options
.PP
These options are useful when developing or debugging rclone.
There are also some more remote specific options which aren\[cq]t
documented here which are used for testing.
These start with remote name eg \f[C]\-\-drive\-test\-option\f[R] \- see
the docs for the remote in question.
.SS \[en]cpuprofile=FILE
.PP
Write CPU profile to file.
This can be analysed with \f[C]go tool pprof\f[R].
.SS \[en]dump flag,flag,flag
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-dump\f[R] flag takes a comma separated list of flags to
dump info about.
.PP
Note that some headers including \f[C]Accept\-Encoding\f[R] as shown may
not be correct in the request and the response may not show
\f[C]Content\-Encoding\f[R] if the go standard libraries auto gzip
encoding was in effect.
In this case the body of the request will be gunzipped before showing
it.
.PP
The available flags are:
.SS \[en]dump headers
.PP
Dump HTTP headers with \f[C]Authorization:\f[R] lines removed.
May still contain sensitive info.
Can be very verbose.
Useful for debugging only.
.PP
Use \f[C]\-\-dump auth\f[R] if you do want the \f[C]Authorization:\f[R]
headers.
.SS \[en]dump bodies
.PP
Dump HTTP headers and bodies \- may contain sensitive info.
Can be very verbose.
Useful for debugging only.
.PP
Note that the bodies are buffered in memory so don\[cq]t use this for
enormous files.
.SS \[en]dump requests
.PP
Like \f[C]\-\-dump bodies\f[R] but dumps the request bodies and the
response headers.
Useful for debugging download problems.
.SS \[en]dump responses
.PP
Like \f[C]\-\-dump bodies\f[R] but dumps the response bodies and the
request headers.
Useful for debugging upload problems.
.SS \[en]dump auth
.PP
Dump HTTP headers \- will contain sensitive info such as
\f[C]Authorization:\f[R] headers \- use \f[C]\-\-dump headers\f[R] to
dump without \f[C]Authorization:\f[R] headers.
Can be very verbose.
Useful for debugging only.
.SS \[en]dump filters
.PP
Dump the filters to the output.
Useful to see exactly what include and exclude options are filtering on.
.SS \[en]dump goroutines
.PP
This dumps a list of the running go\-routines at the end of the command
to standard output.
.SS \[en]dump openfiles
.PP
This dumps a list of the open files at the end of the command.
It uses the \f[C]lsof\f[R] command to do that so you\[cq]ll need that
installed to use it.
.SS \[en]memprofile=FILE
.PP
Write memory profile to file.
This can be analysed with \f[C]go tool pprof\f[R].

.SS Logging
.PP
rclone has 4 levels of logging, \f[C]ERROR\f[R], \f[C]NOTICE\f[R],
\f[C]INFO\f[R] and \f[C]DEBUG\f[R].
.PP
By default, rclone logs to standard error.
This means you can redirect standard error and still see the normal
output of rclone commands (eg \f[C]rclone ls\f[R]).
.PP
By default, rclone will produce \f[C]Error\f[R] and \f[C]Notice\f[R]
level messages.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-q\f[R] flag, rclone will only produce
\f[C]Error\f[R] messages.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-v\f[R] flag, rclone will produce \f[C]Error\f[R],
\f[C]Notice\f[R] and \f[C]Info\f[R] messages.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-vv\f[R] flag, rclone will produce \f[C]Error\f[R],
\f[C]Notice\f[R], \f[C]Info\f[R] and \f[C]Debug\f[R] messages.
.PP
You can also control the log levels with the \f[C]\-\-log\-level\f[R]
flag.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-\-log\-file=FILE\f[R] option, rclone will redirect
\f[C]Error\f[R], \f[C]Info\f[R] and \f[C]Debug\f[R] messages along with
standard error to FILE.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-\-syslog\f[R] flag then rclone will log to syslog
and the \f[C]\-\-syslog\-facility\f[R] control which facility it uses.
.PP
Rclone prefixes all log messages with their level in capitals, eg INFO
which makes it easy to grep the log file for different kinds of
information.
.SS Exit Code
.PP
If any errors occur during the command execution, rclone will exit with
a non\-zero exit code.
This allows scripts to detect when rclone operations have failed.
.PP
During the startup phase, rclone will exit immediately if an error is
detected in the configuration.
There will always be a log message immediately before exiting.
.PP
When rclone is running it will accumulate errors as it goes along, and
only exit with a non\-zero exit code if (after retries) there were still
failed transfers.
For every error counted there will be a high priority log message
(visible with \f[C]\-q\f[R]) showing the message and which file caused
the problem.
A high priority message is also shown when starting a retry so the user
can see that any previous error messages may not be valid after the
retry.
If rclone has done a retry it will log a high priority message if the
retry was successful.

.SS Environment Variables
.PP
Rclone can be configured entirely using environment variables.
These can be used to set defaults for options or config file entries.
.SS Options
.PP
Every option in rclone can have its default set by environment variable.
.PP
To find the name of the environment variable, first, take the long
option name, strip the leading \f[C]\-\-\f[R], change \f[C]\-\f[R] to
\f[C]_\f[R], make upper case and prepend \f[C]RCLONE_\f[R].
.PP
For example, to always set \f[C]\-\-stats 5s\f[R], set the environment
variable \f[C]RCLONE_STATS=5s\f[R].
If you set stats on the command line this will override the environment
variable setting.
.PP
Or to always use the trash in drive \f[C]\-\-drive\-use\-trash\f[R], set
\f[C]RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH=true\f[R].
.PP
The same parser is used for the options and the environment variables so
they take exactly the same form.
.SS Config file
.PP
You can set defaults for values in the config file on an individual
remote basis.
If you want to use this feature, you will need to discover the name of
the config items that you want.
The easiest way is to run through \f[C]rclone config\f[R] by hand, then
look in the config file to see what the values are (the config file can
be found by looking at the help for \f[C]\-\-config\f[R] in
\f[C]rclone help\f[R]).
.PP
To find the name of the environment variable, you need to set, take
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_\f[R] + name of remote + \f[C]_\f[R] + name of config
file option and make it all uppercase.
.PP
For example, to configure an S3 remote named \f[C]mys3:\f[R] without a
config file (using unix ways of setting environment variables):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_TYPE=s3
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
$ rclone lsd MYS3:
          \-1 2016\-09\-21 12:54:21        \-1 my\-bucket
$ rclone listremotes | grep mys3
mys3:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that if you want to create a remote using environment variables you
must create the \f[C]..._TYPE\f[R] variable as above.
.SS Other environment variables
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[R] set to contain your config file password
(see Configuration Encryption section)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]HTTP_PROXY\f[R], \f[C]HTTPS_PROXY\f[R] and \f[C]NO_PROXY\f[R] (or
the lowercase versions thereof).
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]HTTPS_PROXY\f[R] takes precedence over \f[C]HTTP_PROXY\f[R] for
https requests.
.IP \[bu] 2
The environment values may be either a complete URL or a
\[lq]host[:port]\[rq] for, in which case the \[lq]http\[rq] scheme is
assumed.
.RE
.SH Configuring rclone on a remote / headless machine
.PP
Some of the configurations (those involving oauth2) require an Internet
connected web browser.
.PP
If you are trying to set rclone up on a remote or headless box with no
browser available on it (eg a NAS or a server in a datacenter) then you
will need to use an alternative means of configuration.
There are two ways of doing it, described below.
.SS Configuring using rclone authorize
.PP
On the headless box run \f[C]rclone\f[R] config but answer \f[C]N\f[R]
to the \f[C]Use auto config?\f[R] question.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\&...
Remote config
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes (default)
n) No
y/n> n
For this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has
a web browser available.

For more help and alternate methods see: https://rclone.org/remote_setup/

Execute the following on the machine with the web browser (same rclone
version recommended):

    rclone authorize \[dq]amazon cloud drive\[dq]

Then paste the result below:

\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then on your main desktop machine
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

\f[R]
.fi
.SS Configuring by copying the config file
.PP
Rclone stores all of its config in a single configuration file.
This can easily be copied to configure a remote rclone.
.PP
So first configure rclone on your desktop machine with
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone config
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
to set up the config file.
.PP
Find the config file by running \f[C]rclone config file\f[R], for
example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone config file
Configuration file is stored at:
/home/user/.rclone.conf
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Now transfer it to the remote box (scp, cut paste, ftp, sftp etc) and
place it in the correct place (use \f[C]rclone config file\f[R] on the
remote box to find out where).
.SH Filtering, includes and excludes
.PP
Rclone has a sophisticated set of include and exclude rules.
Some of these are based on patterns and some on other things like file
size.
.PP
The filters are applied for the \f[C]copy\f[R], \f[C]sync\f[R],
\f[C]move\f[R], \f[C]ls\f[R], \f[C]lsl\f[R], \f[C]md5sum\f[R],
\f[C]sha1sum\f[R], \f[C]size\f[R], \f[C]delete\f[R] and \f[C]check\f[R]
operations.
Note that \f[C]purge\f[R] does not obey the filters.
.PP
Each path as it passes through rclone is matched against the include and
exclude rules like \f[C]\-\-include\f[R], \f[C]\-\-exclude\f[R],
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[R], \f[C]\-\-exclude\-from\f[R],
\f[C]\-\-filter\f[R], or \f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[R].
The simplest way to try them out is using the \f[C]ls\f[R] command, or
\f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[R] together with \f[C]\-v\f[R].
\f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[R], \f[C]\-\-exclude\-from\f[R],
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[R], \f[C]\-\-files\-from\f[R],
\f[C]\-\-files\-from\-raw\f[R] understand \f[C]\-\f[R] as a file name to
mean read from standard input.
.SS Patterns
.PP
The patterns used to match files for inclusion or exclusion are based on
\[lq]file globs\[rq] as used by the unix shell.
.PP
If the pattern starts with a \f[C]/\f[R] then it only matches at the top
level of the directory tree, \f[B]relative to the root of the
remote\f[R] (not necessarily the root of the local drive).
If it doesn\[cq]t start with \f[C]/\f[R] then it is matched starting at
the \f[B]end of the path\f[R], but it will only match a complete path
element:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
file.jpg  \- matches \[dq]file.jpg\[dq]
          \- matches \[dq]directory/file.jpg\[dq]
          \- doesn\[aq]t match \[dq]afile.jpg\[dq]

.PP
Note also that rclone filter globs can only be used in one of the filter
command line flags, not in the specification of the remote, so
\f[C]rclone copy \[dq]remote:dir*.jpg\[dq] /path/to/dir\f[R] won\[cq]t
work \- what is required is
\f[C]rclone \-\-include \[dq]*.jpg\[dq] copy remote:dir /path/to/dir\f[R]
.SS Directories
.PP
Rclone keeps track of directories that could match any file patterns.
.PP
Eg if you add the include rule
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/a/*.jpg
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Rclone will synthesize the directory include rule
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/a/
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you put any rules which end in \f[C]/\f[R] then it will only match
directories.
.PP
Directory matches are \f[B]only\f[R] used to optimise directory access
patterns \- you must still match the files that you want to match.
Directory matches won\[cq]t optimise anything on bucket based remotes
(eg s3, swift, google compute storage, b2) which don\[cq]t have a
concept of directory.
.SS Differences between rsync and rclone patterns
.PP
Rclone implements bash style \f[C]{a,b,c}\f[R] glob matching which rsync
doesn\[cq]t.
.PP
Rclone always does a wildcard match so \f[C]\[rs]\f[R] must always
escape a \f[C]\[rs]\f[R].
.SS How the rules are used
.PP
Rclone maintains a combined list of include rules and exclude rules.
.PP
Each file is matched in order, starting from the top, against the rule
in the list until it finds a match.
The file is then included or excluded according to the rule type.
.PP
If the matcher fails to find a match after testing against all the
entries in the list then the path is included.
.PP
For example given the following rules, \f[C]+\f[R] being include,
\f[C]\-\f[R] being exclude,
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\- secret*.jpg
+ *.jpg
+ *.png
+ file2.avi
\- *
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This would include
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]file1.jpg\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]file3.png\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]file2.avi\f[R]
.PP
This would exclude
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]secret17.jpg\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
non \f[C]*.jpg\f[R] and \f[C]*.png\f[R]
.PP
A similar process is done on directory entries before recursing into
them.
This only works on remotes which have a concept of directory (Eg local,
google drive, onedrive, amazon drive) and not on bucket based remotes
(eg s3, swift, google compute storage, b2).
.SS Adding filtering rules
.PP
Filtering rules are added with the following command line flags.
.SS Repeating options
.PP
You can repeat the following options to add more than one rule of that
type.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-exclude\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-exclude\-from\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-filter\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-filter\-from\-raw\f[R]
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[R] You should not use \f[C]\-\-include*\f[R] together
with \f[C]\-\-exclude*\f[R].
It may produce different results than you expected.
In that case try to use: \f[C]\-\-filter*\f[R].
.PP
Note that all the options of the same type are processed together in the
order above, regardless of what order they were placed on the command
line.
.PP
So all \f[C]\-\-include\f[R] options are processed first in the order
they appeared on the command line, then all \f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[R]
options etc.
.PP
To mix up the order includes and excludes, the \f[C]\-\-filter\f[R] flag
can be used.
.SS \f[C]\-\-exclude\f[R] \- Exclude files matching pattern
.PP
Add a single exclude rule with \f[C]\-\-exclude\f[R].
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Eg \f[C]\-\-exclude *.bak\f[R] to exclude all bak files from the sync.
.SS \f[C]\-\-exclude\-from\f[R] \- Read exclude patterns from file
.PP
Add exclude rules from a file.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Prepare a file like this \f[C]exclude\-file.txt\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# a sample exclude rule file
*.bak
file2.jpg
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then use as \f[C]\-\-exclude\-from exclude\-file.txt\f[R].
This will sync all files except those ending in \f[C]bak\f[R] and
\f[C]file2.jpg\f[R].
.PP
This is useful if you have a lot of rules.
.SS \f[C]\-\-include\f[R] \- Include files matching pattern
.PP
Add a single include rule with \f[C]\-\-include\f[R].
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Eg \f[C]\-\-include *.{png,jpg}\f[R] to include all \f[C]png\f[R] and
\f[C]jpg\f[R] files in the backup and no others.
.PP
This adds an implicit \f[C]\-\-exclude *\f[R] at the very end of the
filter list.
This means you can mix \f[C]\-\-include\f[R] and
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[R] with the other filters (eg
\f[C]\-\-exclude\f[R]) but you must include all the files you want in
the include statement.
If this doesn\[cq]t provide enough flexibility then you must use
\f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[R].
.SS \f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[R] \- Read include patterns from file
.PP
Add include rules from a file.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Prepare a file like this \f[C]include\-file.txt\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# a sample include rule file
*.jpg
*.png
file2.avi
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then use as \f[C]\-\-include\-from include\-file.txt\f[R].
This will sync all \f[C]jpg\f[R], \f[C]png\f[R] files and
\f[C]file2.avi\f[R].
.PP
This is useful if you have a lot of rules.
.PP
This adds an implicit \f[C]\-\-exclude *\f[R] at the very end of the
filter list.
This means you can mix \f[C]\-\-include\f[R] and
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[R] with the other filters (eg
\f[C]\-\-exclude\f[R]) but you must include all the files you want in
the include statement.
If this doesn\[cq]t provide enough flexibility then you must use
\f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[R].
.SS \f[C]\-\-filter\f[R] \- Add a file\-filtering rule
.PP
This can be used to add a single include or exclude rule.
Include rules start with \f[C]+\f[R] and exclude rules start with
\f[C]\-\f[R].
A special rule called \f[C]!\f[R] can be used to clear the existing
rules.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Eg \f[C]\-\-filter \[dq]\- *.bak\[dq]\f[R] to exclude all bak files from
the sync.
.SS \f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[R] \- Read filtering patterns from a file
.PP
Add include/exclude rules from a file.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Prepare a file like this \f[C]filter\-file.txt\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# a sample filter rule file
\- secret*.jpg
+ *.jpg
+ *.png
+ file2.avi
\- /dir/Trash/**
+ /dir/**
# exclude everything else
\- *
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then use as \f[C]\-\-filter\-from filter\-file.txt\f[R].
The rules are processed in the order that they are defined.
.PP
This example will include all \f[C]jpg\f[R] and \f[C]png\f[R] files,
exclude any files matching \f[C]secret*.jpg\f[R] and include
\f[C]file2.avi\f[R].
It will also include everything in the directory \f[C]dir\f[R] at the
root of the sync, except \f[C]dir/Trash\f[R] which it will exclude.
Everything else will be excluded from the sync.
.SS \f[C]\-\-files\-from\f[R] \- Read list of source\-file names
.PP
This reads a list of file names from the file passed in and
\f[B]only\f[R] these files are transferred.
The \f[B]filtering rules are ignored\f[R] completely if you use this
option.
.PP
\f[C]\-\-files\-from\f[R] expects a list of files as its input.
Leading / trailing whitespace is stripped from the input lines and lines
starting with \f[C]#\f[R] and \f[C];\f[R] are ignored.
.PP
Rclone will traverse the file system if you use
\f[C]\-\-files\-from\f[R], effectively using the files in
\f[C]\-\-files\-from\f[R] as a set of filters.
Rclone will not error if any of the files are missing.
.PP
If you use \f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[R] as well as
\f[C]\-\-files\-from\f[R] then rclone will not traverse the destination
file system, it will find each file individually using approximately 1
API call.
This can be more efficient for small lists of files.
.PP
This option can be repeated to read from more than one file.
These are read in the order that they are placed on the command line.
.PP
Paths within the \f[C]\-\-files\-from\f[R] file will be interpreted as
starting with the root specified in the command.
Leading \f[C]/\f[R] characters are ignored.
See \[en]files\-from\-raw if you need the input to be processed in a raw
manner.
.PP
For example, suppose you had \f[C]files\-from.txt\f[R] with this
content:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# comment
file1.jpg
subdir/file2.jpg
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You could then use it like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy \-\-files\-from files\-from.txt /home/me/pics remote:pics
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will transfer these files only (if they exist)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/me/pics/file1.jpg        \[->] remote:pics/file1.jpg
/home/me/pics/subdir/file2.jpg \[->] remote:pics/subdir/file2.jpg
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To take a more complicated example, let\[cq]s say you had a few files
you want to back up regularly with these absolute paths:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/important
/home/user1/dir/file
/home/user2/stuff
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To copy these you\[cq]d find a common subdirectory \- in this case
\f[C]/home\f[R] and put the remaining files in \f[C]files\-from.txt\f[R]
with or without leading \f[C]/\f[R], eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
user1/important
user1/dir/file
user2/stuff
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You could then copy these to a remote like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy \-\-files\-from files\-from.txt /home remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The 3 files will arrive in \f[C]remote:backup\f[R] with the paths as in
the \f[C]files\-from.txt\f[R] like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/important \[->] remote:backup/user1/important
/home/user1/dir/file  \[->] remote:backup/user1/dir/file
/home/user2/stuff     \[->] remote:backup/user2/stuff
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You could of course choose \f[C]/\f[R] as the root too in which case
your \f[C]files\-from.txt\f[R] might look like this.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/important
/home/user1/dir/file
/home/user2/stuff
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And you would transfer it like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy \-\-files\-from files\-from.txt / remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In this case there will be an extra \f[C]home\f[R] directory on the
remote:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/important \[->] remote:backup/home/user1/important
/home/user1/dir/file  \[->] remote:backup/home/user1/dir/file
/home/user2/stuff     \[->] remote:backup/home/user2/stuff
\f[R]
.fi
.SS \f[C]\-\-files\-from\-raw\f[R] \- Read list of source\-file names without any processing
.PP
This option is same as \f[C]\-\-files\-from\f[R] with the only
difference being that the input is read in a raw manner.
This means that lines with leading/trailing whitespace and lines
starting with \f[C];\f[R] or \f[C]#\f[R] are read without any
processing.
rclone lsf (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsf/) has a compatible
format that can be used to export file lists from remotes, which can
then be used as an input to \f[C]\-\-files\-from\-raw\f[R].
.SS \f[C]\-\-min\-size\f[R] \- Don\[cq]t transfer any file smaller than this
.PP
This option controls the minimum size file which will be transferred.
This defaults to \f[C]kBytes\f[R] but a suffix of \f[C]k\f[R],
\f[C]M\f[R], or \f[C]G\f[R] can be used.
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-min\-size 50k\f[R] means no files smaller than
50kByte will be transferred.
.SS \f[C]\-\-max\-size\f[R] \- Don\[cq]t transfer any file larger than this
.PP
This option controls the maximum size file which will be transferred.
This defaults to \f[C]kBytes\f[R] but a suffix of \f[C]k\f[R],
\f[C]M\f[R], or \f[C]G\f[R] can be used.
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-max\-size 1G\f[R] means no files larger than 1GByte
will be transferred.
.SS \f[C]\-\-max\-age\f[R] \- Don\[cq]t transfer any file older than this
.PP
This option controls the maximum age of files to transfer.
Give in seconds or with a suffix of:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]ms\f[R] \- Milliseconds
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]s\f[R] \- Seconds
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]m\f[R] \- Minutes
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]h\f[R] \- Hours
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]d\f[R] \- Days
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]w\f[R] \- Weeks
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]M\f[R] \- Months
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]y\f[R] \- Years
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-max\-age 2d\f[R] means no files older than 2 days
will be transferred.
.PP
This can also be an absolute time in one of these formats
.IP \[bu] 2
RFC3339 \- eg \[lq]2006\-01\-02T15:04:05Z07:00\[rq]
.IP \[bu] 2
ISO8601 Date and time, local timezone \- \[lq]2006\-01\-02T15:04:05\[rq]
.IP \[bu] 2
ISO8601 Date and time, local timezone \- \[lq]2006\-01\-02 15:04:05\[rq]
.IP \[bu] 2
ISO8601 Date \- \[lq]2006\-01\-02\[rq] (YYYY\-MM\-DD)
.SS \f[C]\-\-min\-age\f[R] \- Don\[cq]t transfer any file younger than this
.PP
This option controls the minimum age of files to transfer.
Give in seconds or with a suffix (see \f[C]\-\-max\-age\f[R] for list of
suffixes)
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-min\-age 2d\f[R] means no files younger than 2 days
will be transferred.
.SS \f[C]\-\-delete\-excluded\f[R] \- Delete files on dest excluded from sync
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[R] this flag is dangerous \- use with
\f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[R] and \f[C]\-v\f[R] first.
.PP
When doing \f[C]rclone sync\f[R] this will delete any files which are
excluded from the sync on the destination.
.PP
If for example you did a sync from \f[C]A\f[R] to \f[C]B\f[R] without
the \f[C]\-\-min\-size 50k\f[R] flag
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync A: B:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then you repeated it like this with the \f[C]\-\-delete\-excluded\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone \-\-min\-size 50k \-\-delete\-excluded sync A: B:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This would delete all files on \f[C]B\f[R] which are less than 50 kBytes
as these are now excluded from the sync.
.PP
Always test first with \f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[R] and \f[C]\-v\f[R] before
using this flag.
.SS \f[C]\-\-dump filters\f[R] \- dump the filters to the output
.PP
This dumps the defined filters to the output as regular expressions.
.PP
Useful for debugging.
.SS \f[C]\-\-ignore\-case\f[R] \- make searches case insensitive
.PP
Normally filter patterns are case sensitive.
If this flag is supplied then filter patterns become case insensitive.
.PP
Normally a \f[C]\-\-include \[dq]file.txt\[dq]\f[R] will not match a
file called \f[C]FILE.txt\f[R].
However if you use the \f[C]\-\-ignore\-case\f[R] flag then
\f[C]\-\-include \[dq]file.txt\[dq]\f[R] this will match a file called
\f[C]FILE.txt\f[R].
.SS Quoting shell metacharacters
.PP
The examples above may not work verbatim in your shell as they have
shell metacharacters in them (eg \f[C]*\f[R]), and may require quoting.
.PP
Eg linux, OSX
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include \[rs]*.jpg\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include \[aq]*.jpg\[aq]\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include=\[aq]*.jpg\[aq]\f[R]
.PP
In Windows the expansion is done by the command not the shell so this
should work fine
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include *.jpg\f[R]
.SS Exclude directory based on a file
.PP
It is possible to exclude a directory based on a file, which is present
in this directory.
Filename should be specified using the
\f[C]\-\-exclude\-if\-present\f[R] flag.
This flag has a priority over the other filtering flags.
.PP
Imagine, you have the following directory structure:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
dir1/file1
dir1/dir2/file2
dir1/dir2/dir3/file3
dir1/dir2/dir3/.ignore
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You can exclude \f[C]dir3\f[R] from sync by running the following
command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync \-\-exclude\-if\-present .ignore dir1 remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Currently only one filename is supported,
i.e.\ \f[C]\-\-exclude\-if\-present\f[R] should not be used multiple
times.
.SH GUI (Experimental)
.PP
Rclone can serve a web based GUI (graphical user interface).
This is somewhat experimental at the moment so things may be subject to
change.
.PP
Run this command in a terminal and rclone will download and then display
the GUI in a web browser.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rcd \-\-rc\-web\-gui
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will produce logs like this and rclone needs to continue to run to
serve the GUI:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

.PP
This assumes you are running rclone locally on your machine.
It is possible to separate the rclone and the GUI \- see below for
details.
.PP
If you wish to check for updates then you can add
\f[C]\-\-rc\-web\-gui\-update\f[R] to the command line.
.PP
If you find your GUI broken, you may force it to update by add
\f[C]\-\-rc\-web\-gui\-force\-update\f[R].
.PP
By default, rclone will open your browser.
Add \f[C]\-\-rc\-web\-gui\-no\-open\-browser\f[R] to disable this
feature.
.SS Using the GUI
.PP
Once the GUI opens, you will be looking at the dashboard which has an
overall overview.
.PP
On the left hand side you will see a series of view buttons you can
click on:
.IP \[bu] 2
Dashboard \- main overview
.IP \[bu] 2
Configs \- examine and create new configurations
.IP \[bu] 2
Explorer \- view, download and upload files to the cloud storage systems
.IP \[bu] 2
Backend \- view or alter the backend config
.IP \[bu] 2
Log out
.PP
(More docs and walkthrough video to come!)
.SS How it works
.PP
When you run the \f[C]rclone rcd \-\-rc\-web\-gui\f[R] this is what
happens
.IP \[bu] 2
Rclone starts but only runs the remote control API (\[lq]rc\[rq]).
.IP \[bu] 2
The API is bound to localhost with an auto generated username and
password.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the API bundle is missing then rclone will download it.
.IP \[bu] 2
rclone will start serving the files from the API bundle over the same
port as the API
.IP \[bu] 2
rclone will open the browser with a \f[C]login_token\f[R] so it can log
straight in.
.SS Advanced use
.PP
The \f[C]rclone rcd\f[R] may use any of the flags documented on the rc
page (https://rclone.org/rc/#supported-parameters).
.PP
The flag \f[C]\-\-rc\-web\-gui\f[R] is shorthand for
.IP \[bu] 2
Download the web GUI if necessary
.IP \[bu] 2
Check we are using some authentication
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-user gui\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-pass <random password>\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-serve\f[R]
.PP
These flags can be overridden as desired.
.PP
See also the rclone rcd
documentation (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rcd/).
.SS Example: Running a public GUI
.PP
For example the GUI could be served on a public port over SSL using an
htpasswd file using the following flags:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-web\-gui\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-addr :443\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-cert /path/to/ssl.crt\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-key /path/to/ssl.key\f[R]

If you want to run the GUI behind a proxy at \f[C]/rclone\f[R] you could
use these flags:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-web\-gui\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-baseurl rclone\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd\f[R]
.PP
Or instead of htpasswd if you just want a single user and password:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-user me\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-pass mypassword\f[R]
.SS Project
.PP
The GUI is being developed in the: rclone/rclone\-webui\-react
repository (https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react).
.PP
Bug reports and contributions are very welcome :\-)
.PP
If you have questions then please ask them on the rclone
forum (https://forum.rclone.org/).
.SH Remote controlling rclone with its API
.PP
If rclone is run with the \f[C]\-\-rc\f[R] flag then it starts an http
server which can be used to remote control rclone using its API.
.PP
If you just want to run a remote control then see the rcd
command (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rcd/).
.SS Supported parameters

.PP
Timeout for server writing data (default 1h0m0s)
.SS \[en]rc\-serve
.PP
Enable the serving of remote objects via the HTTP interface.
This means objects will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5572/ by
default, so you can browse to http://127.0.0.1:5572/ or
http://127.0.0.1:5572/* to see a listing of the remotes.
Objects may be requested from remotes using this syntax
http://127.0.0.1:5572/[remote:path]/path/to/object
.PP
Default Off.
.SS \[en]rc\-files /path/to/directory
.PP
Path to local files to serve on the HTTP server.
.PP
If this is set then rclone will serve the files in that directory.
It will also open the root in the web browser if specified.
This is for implementing browser based GUIs for rclone functions.
.PP
If \f[C]\-\-rc\-user\f[R] or \f[C]\-\-rc\-pass\f[R] is set then the URL
that is opened will have the authorization in the URL in the
\f[C]http://user:pass\[at]localhost/\f[R] style.
.PP
Default Off.
.SS \[en]rc\-enable\-metrics
.PP
Enable OpenMetrics/Prometheus compatible endpoint at \f[C]/metrics\f[R].
.PP
Default Off.
.SS \[en]rc\-web\-gui
.PP
Set this flag to serve the default web gui on the same port as rclone.
.PP
Default Off.
.SS \[en]rc\-allow\-origin
.PP
Set the allowed Access\-Control\-Allow\-Origin for rc requests.
.PP
Can be used with \[en]rc\-web\-gui if the rclone is running on different
IP than the web\-gui.
.PP
Default is IP address on which rc is running.
.SS \[en]rc\-web\-fetch\-url
.PP
Set the URL to fetch the rclone\-web\-gui files from.
.PP
Default
https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone\-webui\-react/releases/latest.
.SS \[en]rc\-web\-gui\-update

.PP
Expire finished async jobs older than DURATION (default 60s).
.SS \[en]rc\-job\-expire\-interval=DURATION
.PP
Interval duration to check for expired async jobs (default 10s).
.SS \[en]rc\-no\-auth
.PP
By default rclone will require authorisation to have been set up on the
rc interface in order to use any methods which access any rclone
remotes.
Eg \f[C]operations/list\f[R] is denied as it involved creating a remote
as is \f[C]sync/copy\f[R].
.PP
If this is set then no authorisation will be required on the server to
use these methods.
The alternative is to use \f[C]\-\-rc\-user\f[R] and
\f[C]\-\-rc\-pass\f[R] and use these credentials in the request.
.PP
Default Off.
.SS Accessing the remote control via the rclone rc command
.PP
Rclone itself implements the remote control protocol in its
\f[C]rclone rc\f[R] command.
.PP
You can use it like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone rc rc/noop param1=one param2=two
{
    \[dq]param1\[dq]: \[dq]one\[dq],
    \[dq]param2\[dq]: \[dq]two\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Run \f[C]rclone rc\f[R] on its own to see the help for the installed
remote control commands.
.PP
\f[C]rclone rc\f[R] also supports a \f[C]\-\-json\f[R] flag which can be
used to send more complicated input parameters.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone rc \-\-json \[aq]{ \[dq]p1\[dq]: [1,\[dq]2\[dq],null,4], \[dq]p2\[dq]: { \[dq]a\[dq]:1, \[dq]b\[dq]:2 } }\[aq] rc/noop
{
    \[dq]p1\[dq]: [
        1,
        \[dq]2\[dq],
        null,
        4
    ],
    \[dq]p2\[dq]: {
        \[dq]a\[dq]: 1,
        \[dq]b\[dq]: 2
    }
}
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Special parameters
.PP
The rc interface supports some special parameters which apply to
\f[B]all\f[R] commands.
These start with \f[C]_\f[R] to show they are different.
.SS Running asynchronous jobs with _async = true
.PP
Each rc call is classified as a job and it is assigned its own id.
By default jobs are executed immediately as they are created or
synchronously.
.PP
If \f[C]_async\f[R] has a true value when supplied to an rc call then it
will return immediately with a job id and the task will be run in the
background.
The \f[C]job/status\f[R] call can be used to get information of the
background job.
The job can be queried for up to 1 minute after it has finished.
.PP
It is recommended that potentially long running jobs, eg
\f[C]sync/sync\f[R], \f[C]sync/copy\f[R], \f[C]sync/move\f[R],
\f[C]operations/purge\f[R] are run with the \f[C]_async\f[R] flag to
avoid any potential problems with the HTTP request and response timing
out.
.PP
Starting a job with the \f[C]_async\f[R] flag:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone rc \-\-json \[aq]{ \[dq]p1\[dq]: [1,\[dq]2\[dq],null,4], \[dq]p2\[dq]: { \[dq]a\[dq]:1, \[dq]b\[dq]:2 }, \[dq]_async\[dq]: true }\[aq] rc/noop
{
    \[dq]jobid\[dq]: 2
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Query the status to see if the job has finished.
For more information on the meaning of these return parameters see the
\f[C]job/status\f[R] call.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone rc \-\-json \[aq]{ \[dq]jobid\[dq]:2 }\[aq] job/status
{
    \[dq]duration\[dq]: 0.000124163,
    \[dq]endTime\[dq]: \[dq]2018\-10\-27T11:38:07.911245881+01:00\[dq],
    \[dq]error\[dq]: \[dq]\[dq],
    \[dq]finished\[dq]: true,
    \[dq]id\[dq]: 2,
    \[dq]output\[dq]: {
        \[dq]_async\[dq]: true,
        \[dq]p1\[dq]: [
            1,
            \[dq]2\[dq],
            null,
            4
        ],
        \[dq]p2\[dq]: {
            \[dq]a\[dq]: 1,
            \[dq]b\[dq]: 2
        }
    },
    \[dq]startTime\[dq]: \[dq]2018\-10\-27T11:38:07.911121728+01:00\[dq],
    \[dq]success\[dq]: true
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[C]job/list\f[R] can be used to show the running or recently completed
jobs
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone rc job/list
{
    \[dq]jobids\[dq]: [
        2
    ]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Assigning operations to groups with _group = value
.PP
Each rc call has its own stats group for tracking its metrics.
By default grouping is done by the composite group name from prefix
\f[C]job/\f[R] and id of the job like so \f[C]job/1\f[R].
.PP
If \f[C]_group\f[R] has a value then stats for that request will be
grouped under that value.
This allows caller to group stats under their own name.
.PP
Stats for specific group can be accessed by passing \f[C]group\f[R] to
\f[C]core/stats\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone rc \-\-json \[aq]{ \[dq]group\[dq]: \[dq]job/1\[dq] }\[aq] core/stats
{
    \[dq]speed\[dq]: 12345
    ...
}
\f[R]

command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend noop . \-o echo=yes \-o blue path1 path2
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that arguments must be preceded by the \[lq]\-a\[rq] flag

.SS cache/fetch: Fetch file chunks
.PP
Ensure the specified file chunks are cached on disk.
.PP
The chunks= parameter specifies the file chunks to check.
It takes a comma separated list of array slice indices.
The slice indices are similar to Python slices: start[:end]
.PP
start is the 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the file to
fetch inclusive.
end is 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the file to fetch
exclusive.
Both values can be negative, in which case they count from the back of
the file.
The value \[lq]\-5:\[rq] represents the last 5 chunks of a file.
.PP
Some valid examples are: \[lq]:5,\-5:\[rq] \-> the first and last five
chunks \[lq]0,\-2\[rq] \-> the first and the second last chunk
\[lq]0:10\[rq] \-> the first ten chunks
.PP
Any parameter with a key that starts with \[lq]file\[rq] can be used to
specify files to fetch, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

.SS debug/set\-block\-profile\-rate: Set runtime.SetBlockProfileRate for blocking profiling.
.PP
SetBlockProfileRate controls the fraction of goroutine blocking events
that are reported in the blocking profile.
The profiler aims to sample an average of one blocking event per rate
nanoseconds spent blocked.
.PP
To include every blocking event in the profile, pass rate = 1.
To turn off profiling entirely, pass rate <= 0.
.PP
After calling this you can use this to see the blocking profile:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/block
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Parameters
.IP \[bu] 2
rate \- int
.SS debug/set\-mutex\-profile\-fraction: Set runtime.SetMutexProfileFraction for mutex profiling.
.PP
SetMutexProfileFraction controls the fraction of mutex contention events
that are reported in the mutex profile.
On average 1/rate events are reported.
The previous rate is returned.
.PP
To turn off profiling entirely, pass rate 0.
To just read the current rate, pass rate < 0.
(For n>1 the details of sampling may change.)
.PP
Once this is set you can look use this to profile the mutex contention:

If the parameter recursive=true is given the whole directory tree will
get refreshed.
This refresh will use \[en]fast\-list if enabled.
.SS Accessing the remote control via HTTP
.PP
Rclone implements a simple HTTP based protocol.
.PP
Each endpoint takes an JSON object and returns a JSON object or an
error.
The JSON objects are essentially a map of string names to values.
.PP
All calls must made using POST.
.PP
The input objects can be supplied using URL parameters, POST parameters
or by supplying \[lq]Content\-Type: application/json\[rq] and a JSON
blob in the body.
There are examples of these below using \f[C]curl\f[R].
.PP
The response will be a JSON blob in the body of the response.
This is formatted to be reasonably human readable.
.SS Error returns
.PP
If an error occurs then there will be an HTTP error status (eg 500) and
the body of the response will contain a JSON encoded error object, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

.SS Debugging rclone with pprof
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-\-rc\f[R] flag this will also enable the use of
the go profiling tools on the same port.
.PP
To use these, first install go (https://golang.org/doc/install).
.SS Debugging memory use
.PP
To profile rclone\[cq]s memory use you can run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
go tool pprof \-web http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This should open a page in your browser showing what is using what
memory.
.PP
You can also use the \f[C]\-text\f[R] flag to produce a textual summary
.IP

.TE
.SS Hash
.PP
The cloud storage system supports various hash types of the objects.
The hashes are used when transferring data as an integrity check and can
be specifically used with the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[R] flag in syncs and
in the \f[C]check\f[R] command.
.PP
To use the verify checksums when transferring between cloud storage
systems they must support a common hash type.
.PP
\[dg] Note that Dropbox supports its own custom
hash (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/content-hash).
This is an SHA256 sum of all the 4MB block SHA256s.
.PP
\[dd] SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and
\f[C]md5sum\f[R] or \f[C]sha1sum\f[R] as well as \f[C]echo\f[R] are in
the remote\[cq]s PATH.
.PP
\[dg]\[dg] WebDAV supports hashes when used with Owncloud and Nextcloud
only.
.PP
\[dg]\[dg]\[dg] WebDAV supports modtimes when used with Owncloud and
Nextcloud only.
.PP
\[dd]\[dd] Microsoft OneDrive Personal supports SHA1 hashes, whereas
OneDrive for business and SharePoint server support Microsoft\[cq]s own
QuickXorHash (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/code-snippets/quickxorhash).
.PP
\[dd]\[dd]\[dd] Mail.ru uses its own modified SHA1 hash
.SS ModTime
.PP
The cloud storage system supports setting modification times on objects.
If it does then this enables a using the modification times as part of
the sync.
If not then only the size will be checked by default, though the MD5SUM
can be checked with the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[R] flag.
.PP
All cloud storage systems support some kind of date on the object and
these will be set when transferring from the cloud storage system.
.SS Case Insensitive
.PP
If a cloud storage systems is case sensitive then it is possible to have
two files which differ only in case, eg \f[C]file.txt\f[R] and
\f[C]FILE.txt\f[R].
If a cloud storage system is case insensitive then that isn\[cq]t
possible.
.PP
This can cause problems when syncing between a case insensitive system
and a case sensitive system.
The symptom of this is that no matter how many times you run the sync it
never completes fully.
.PP
The local filesystem and SFTP may or may not be case sensitive depending
on OS.
.IP \[bu] 2
Windows \- usually case insensitive, though case is preserved
.IP \[bu] 2
OSX \- usually case insensitive, though it is possible to format case
sensitive
.IP \[bu] 2
Linux \- usually case sensitive, but there are case insensitive file
systems (eg FAT formatted USB keys)
.PP
Most of the time this doesn\[cq]t cause any problems as people tend to
avoid files whose name differs only by case even on case sensitive
systems.
.SS Duplicate files
.PP
If a cloud storage system allows duplicate files then it can have two
objects with the same name.
.PP
This confuses rclone greatly when syncing \- use the
\f[C]rclone dedupe\f[R] command to rename or remove duplicates.
.SS Restricted filenames
.PP
Some cloud storage systems might have restrictions on the characters
that are usable in file or directory names.
When \f[C]rclone\f[R] detects such a name during a file upload, it will
transparently replace the restricted characters with similar looking
Unicode characters.
.PP
This process is designed to avoid ambiguous file names as much as
possible and allow to move files between many cloud storage systems
transparently.
.PP
The name shown by \f[C]rclone\f[R] to the user or during log output will
only contain a minimal set of replaced characters to ensure correct
formatting and not necessarily the actual name used on the cloud
storage.
.PP
This transformation is reversed when downloading a file or parsing
\f[C]rclone\f[R] arguments.
For example, when uploading a file named \f[C]my file?.txt\f[R] to
Onedrive will be displayed as \f[C]my file?.txt\f[R] on the console, but
stored as \f[C]my file\[uFF1F].txt\f[R] (the \f[C]?\f[R] gets replaced
by the similar looking \f[C]\[uFF1F]\f[R] character) to Onedrive.
The reverse transformation allows to read a
file\f[C]unusual/name.txt\f[R] from Google Drive, by passing the name
\f[C]unusual\[uFF0F]name.txt\f[R] (the \f[C]/\f[R] needs to be replaced
by the similar looking \f[C]\[uFF0F]\f[R] character) on the command
line.
.SS Default restricted characters
.PP
The table below shows the characters that are replaced by default.
.PP
When a replacement character is found in a filename, this character will
be escaped with the \f[C]\[u201B]\f[R] character to avoid ambiguous file
names.
(e.g.\ a file named \f[C]\[u2400].txt\f[R] would shown as
\f[C]\[u201B]\[u2400].txt\f[R])
.PP
Each cloud storage backend can use a different set of characters, which
will be specified in the documentation for each backend.

.SS Invalid UTF\-8 bytes
.PP
Some backends only support a sequence of well formed UTF\-8 bytes as
file or directory names.
.PP
In this case all invalid UTF\-8 bytes will be replaced with a quoted
representation of the byte value to allow uploading a file to such a
backend.
For example, the invalid byte \f[C]0xFE\f[R] will be encoded as
\f[C]\[u201B]FE\f[R].
.PP
A common source of invalid UTF\-8 bytes are local filesystems, that
store names in a different encoding than UTF\-8 or UTF\-16, like latin1.
See the local filenames (https://rclone.org/local/#filenames) section
for details.
.SS Encoding option
.PP
Most backends have an encoding options, specified as a flag
\f[C]\-\-backend\-encoding\f[R] where \f[C]backend\f[R] is the name of
the backend, or as a config parameter \f[C]encoding\f[R] (you\[cq]ll
need to select the Advanced config in \f[C]rclone config\f[R] to see
it).
.PP
This will have default value which encodes and decodes characters in
such a way as to preserve the maximum number of characters (see above).
.PP
However this can be incorrect in some scenarios, for example if you have
a Windows file system with characters such as \f[C]\[uFF0A]\f[R] and
\f[C]\[uFF1F]\f[R] that you want to remain as those characters on the
remote rather than being translated to \f[C]*\f[R] and \f[C]?\f[R].
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-backend\-encoding\f[R] flags allow you to change that.
You can disable the encoding completely with
\f[C]\-\-backend\-encoding None\f[R] or set \f[C]encoding = None\f[R] in
the config file.
.PP
Encoding takes a comma separated list of encodings.
You can see the list of all available characters by passing an invalid
value to this flag, eg \f[C]\-\-local\-encoding \[dq]help\[dq]\f[R] and
\f[C]rclone help flags encoding\f[R] will show you the defaults for the
backends.

To take a specific example, the FTP backend\[cq]s default encoding is
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-ftp\-encoding \[dq]Slash,Del,Ctl,RightSpace,Dot\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
However, let\[cq]s say the FTP server is running on Windows and
can\[cq]t have any of the invalid Windows characters in file names.
You are backing up Linux servers to this FTP server which do have those
characters in file names.
So you would add the Windows set which are
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
to the existing ones, giving:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot,Del,RightSpace
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This can be specified using the \f[C]\-\-ftp\-encoding\f[R] flag or
using an \f[C]encoding\f[R] parameter in the config file.
.PP
Or let\[cq]s say you have a Windows server but you want to preserve
\f[C]\[uFF0A]\f[R] and \f[C]\[uFF1F]\f[R], you would then have this as
the encoding (the Windows encoding minus \f[C]Asterisk\f[R] and
\f[C]Question\f[R]).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This can be specified using the \f[C]\-\-local\-encoding\f[R] flag or
using an \f[C]encoding\f[R] parameter in the config file.
.SS MIME Type
.PP
MIME types (also known as media types) classify types of documents using
a simple text classification, eg \f[C]text/html\f[R] or
\f[C]application/pdf\f[R].
.PP
Some cloud storage systems support reading (\f[C]R\f[R]) the MIME type
of objects and some support writing (\f[C]W\f[R]) the MIME type of
objects.
.PP
The MIME type can be important if you are serving files directly to HTTP
from the storage system.
.PP
If you are copying from a remote which supports reading (\f[C]R\f[R]) to
a remote which supports writing (\f[C]W\f[R]) then rclone will preserve
the MIME types.
Otherwise they will be guessed from the extension, or the remote itself
may assign the MIME type.
.SS Optional Features
.PP
All the remotes support a basic set of features, but there are some
optional features supported by some remotes used to make some operations
more efficient.

.TE
.SS Purge
.PP
This deletes a directory quicker than just deleting all the files in the
directory.
.PP
\[dg] Note Swift, Hubic, and Tardigrade implement this in order to
delete directory markers but they don\[cq]t actually have a quicker way
of deleting files other than deleting them individually.
.PP
\[dd] StreamUpload is not supported with Nextcloud
.SS Copy
.PP
Used when copying an object to and from the same remote.
This known as a server side copy so you can copy a file without
downloading it and uploading it again.
It is used if you use \f[C]rclone copy\f[R] or \f[C]rclone move\f[R] if
the remote doesn\[cq]t support \f[C]Move\f[R] directly.
.PP
If the server doesn\[cq]t support \f[C]Copy\f[R] directly then for copy
operations the file is downloaded then re\-uploaded.
.SS Move
.PP
Used when moving/renaming an object on the same remote.
This is known as a server side move of a file.
This is used in \f[C]rclone move\f[R] if the server doesn\[cq]t support
\f[C]DirMove\f[R].
.PP
If the server isn\[cq]t capable of \f[C]Move\f[R] then rclone simulates
it with \f[C]Copy\f[R] then delete.
If the server doesn\[cq]t support \f[C]Copy\f[R] then rclone will
download the file and re\-upload it.
.SS DirMove
.PP
This is used to implement \f[C]rclone move\f[R] to move a directory if
possible.
If it isn\[cq]t then it will use \f[C]Move\f[R] on each file (which
falls back to \f[C]Copy\f[R] then download and upload \- see
\f[C]Move\f[R] section).
.SS CleanUp
.PP
This is used for emptying the trash for a remote by
\f[C]rclone cleanup\f[R].
.PP
If the server can\[cq]t do \f[C]CleanUp\f[R] then
\f[C]rclone cleanup\f[R] will return an error.
.SS ListR
.PP
The remote supports a recursive list to list all the contents beneath a
directory quickly.
This enables the \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R] flag to work.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.SS StreamUpload
.PP
Some remotes allow files to be uploaded without knowing the file size in
advance.
This allows certain operations to work without spooling the file to
local disk first, e.g.\ \f[C]rclone rcat\f[R].
.SS LinkSharing
.PP
Sets the necessary permissions on a file or folder and prints a link
that allows others to access them, even if they don\[cq]t have an
account on the particular cloud provider.
.SS About
.PP
This is used to fetch quota information from the remote, like bytes
used/free/quota and bytes used in the trash.
.PP
This is also used to return the space used, available for
\f[C]rclone mount\f[R].
.PP
If the server can\[cq]t do \f[C]About\f[R] then \f[C]rclone about\f[R]
will return an error.
.SS EmptyDir
.PP
The remote supports empty directories.
See Limitations (https://rclone.org/bugs/#limitations) for details.
Most Object/Bucket based remotes do not support this.
.SH Global Flags
.PP
This describes the global flags available to every rclone command split
into two groups, non backend and backend flags.
.SS Non Backend Flags
.PP
These flags are available for every command.

.SS Alias
.PP
The \f[C]alias\f[R] remote provides a new name for another remote.
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required or a local path, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R] or
\f[C]/directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.PP
During the initial setup with \f[C]rclone config\f[R] you will specify
the target remote.
The target remote can either be a local path or another remote.
.PP
Subfolders can be used in target remote.
Assume an alias remote named \f[C]backup\f[R] with the target
\f[C]mydrive:private/backup\f[R].
Invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir backup:desktop\f[R] is exactly the same as
invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/desktop\f[R].
.PP
There will be no special handling of paths containing \f[C]..\f[R]
segments.
Invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir backup:../desktop\f[R] is exactly the same as
invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/../desktop\f[R].
The empty path is not allowed as a remote.
To alias the current directory use \f[C].\f[R] instead.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make an alias called \f[C]remote\f[R] for
local folder.
First run:

.SS Amazon Drive
.PP
Amazon Drive, formerly known as Amazon Cloud Drive, is a cloud storage
service run by Amazon for consumers.
.SS Status
.PP
\f[B]Important:\f[R] rclone supports Amazon Drive only if you have your
own set of API keys.
Unfortunately the Amazon Drive developer
program (https://developer.amazon.com/amazon-drive) is now closed to new
entries so if you don\[cq]t already have your own set of keys you will
not be able to use rclone with Amazon Drive.
.PP
For the history on why rclone no longer has a set of Amazon Drive API
keys see the
forum (https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-has-been-banned-from-amazon-drive/2314).
.PP
If you happen to know anyone who works at Amazon then please ask them to
re\-instate rclone into the Amazon Drive developer program \- thanks!
.SS Setup
.PP
The initial setup for Amazon Drive involves getting a token from Amazon
which you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] walks you through it.
.PP
The configuration process for Amazon Drive may involve using an oauth
proxy (https://github.com/ncw/oauthproxy).
This is used to keep the Amazon credentials out of the source code.
The proxy runs in Google\[cq]s very secure App Engine environment and
doesn\[cq]t store any credentials which pass through it.
.PP
Since rclone doesn\[cq]t currently have its own Amazon Drive credentials
so you will either need to have your own \f[C]client_id\f[R] and
\f[C]client_secret\f[R] with Amazon Drive, or use a third party oauth
proxy in which case you will need to enter \f[C]client_id\f[R],
\f[C]client_secret\f[R], \f[C]auth_url\f[R] and \f[C]token_url\f[R].
.PP
Note also if you are not using Amazon\[cq]s \f[C]auth_url\f[R] and
\f[C]token_url\f[R], (ie you filled in something for those) then if
setting up on a remote machine you can only use the copying the config
method of
configuration (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/#configuring-by-copying-the-config-file)
\- \f[C]rclone authorize\f[R] will not work.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[R].

.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Amazon.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[R] like this,
.PP

.SS Modified time and MD5SUMs
.PP
Amazon Drive doesn\[cq]t allow modification times to be changed via the
API so these won\[cq]t be accurate or used for syncing.
.PP
It does store MD5SUMs so for a more accurate sync, you can use the
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[R] flag.

Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be

.SS Deleting files
.PP
Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.
Amazon don\[cq]t provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to
empty the trash, so you will have to do that with one of Amazon\[cq]s
apps or via the Amazon Drive website.
As of November 17, 2016, files are automatically deleted by Amazon from
the trash after 30 days.
.SS Using with non \f[C].com\f[R] Amazon accounts
.PP
Let\[cq]s say you usually use \f[C]amazon.co.uk\f[R].
When you authenticate with rclone it will take you to an
\f[C]amazon.com\f[R] page to log in.
Your \f[C]amazon.co.uk\f[R] email and password should work here just
fine.

.SS \[en]acd\-upload\-wait\-per\-gb
.PP
Additional time per GB to wait after a failed complete upload to see if
it appears.
.PP
Sometimes Amazon Drive gives an error when a file has been fully
uploaded but the file appears anyway after a little while.
This happens sometimes for files over 1GB in size and nearly every time
for files bigger than 10GB.
This parameter controls the time rclone waits for the file to appear.
.PP
The default value for this parameter is 3 minutes per GB, so by default
it will wait 3 minutes for every GB uploaded to see if the file appears.
.PP
You can disable this feature by setting it to 0.
This may cause conflict errors as rclone retries the failed upload but
the file will most likely appear correctly eventually.
.PP
These values were determined empirically by observing lots of uploads of
big files for a range of file sizes.
.PP

doing in this situation.

Files this size or more will be downloaded via their \[lq]tempLink\[rq].
This is to work around a problem with Amazon Drive which blocks
downloads of files bigger than about 10GB.
The default for this is 9GB which shouldn\[cq]t need to be changed.
.PP
To download files above this threshold, rclone requests a
\[lq]tempLink\[rq] which downloads the file through a temporary URL
directly from the underlying S3 storage.

.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Amazon Drive is case insensitive so you can\[cq]t have a file
called \[lq]Hello.doc\[rq] and one called \[lq]hello.doc\[rq].
.PP
Amazon Drive has rate limiting so you may notice errors in the sync (429
errors).
rclone will automatically retry the sync up to 3 times by default (see
\f[C]\-\-retries\f[R] flag) which should hopefully work around this
problem.
.PP
Amazon Drive has an internal limit of file sizes that can be uploaded to
the service.
This limit is not officially published, but all files larger than this
will fail.
.PP
At the time of writing (Jan 2016) is in the area of 50GB per file.
This means that larger files are likely to fail.
.PP
Unfortunately there is no way for rclone to see that this failure is
because of file size, so it will retry the operation, as any other
failure.
To avoid this problem, use \f[C]\-\-max\-size 50000M\f[R] option to
limit the maximum size of uploaded files.
Note that \f[C]\-\-max\-size\f[R] does not split files into segments, it
only ignores files over this size.

.SS \[en]fast\-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R] which allows you to use
fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.SS \[en]update and \[en]use\-server\-modtime
.PP
As noted below, the modified time is stored on metadata on the object.
It is used by default for all operations that require checking the time
a file was last updated.
It allows rclone to treat the remote more like a true filesystem, but it
is inefficient because it requires an extra API call to retrieve the
metadata.
.PP
For many operations, the time the object was last uploaded to the remote
is sufficient to determine if it is \[lq]dirty\[rq].
By using \f[C]\-\-update\f[R] along with
\f[C]\-\-use\-server\-modtime\f[R], you can avoid the extra API call and
simply upload files whose local modtime is newer than the time it was
last uploaded.
.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X\-Amz\-Meta\-Mtime\f[R] as floating point since the epoch accurate
to 1 ns.
.PP
If the modification time needs to be updated rclone will attempt to
perform a server side copy to update the modification if the object can
be copied in a single part.
In the case the object is larger than 5Gb or is in Glacier or Glacier
Deep Archive storage the object will be uploaded rather than copied.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
S3 allows any valid UTF\-8 string as a key.
.PP
Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[cq]t
be used in XML.
.PP
The following characters are replaced since these are problematic when
dealing with the REST API:

.SS Multipart uploads
.PP
rclone supports multipart uploads with S3 which means that it can upload
files bigger than 5GB.
.PP
Note that files uploaded \f[I]both\f[R] with multipart upload
\f[I]and\f[R] through crypt remotes do not have MD5 sums.
.PP
rclone switches from single part uploads to multipart uploads at the
point specified by \f[C]\-\-s3\-upload\-cutoff\f[R].
This can be a maximum of 5GB and a minimum of 0 (ie always upload
multipart files).
.PP
The chunk sizes used in the multipart upload are specified by
\f[C]\-\-s3\-chunk\-size\f[R] and the number of chunks uploaded
concurrently is specified by \f[C]\-\-s3\-upload\-concurrency\f[R].
.PP
Multipart uploads will use \f[C]\-\-transfers\f[R] *
\f[C]\-\-s3\-upload\-concurrency\f[R] * \f[C]\-\-s3\-chunk\-size\f[R]
extra memory.
Single part uploads to not use extra memory.
.PP
Single part transfers can be faster than multipart transfers or slower
depending on your latency from S3 \- the more latency, the more likely
single part transfers will be faster.
.PP
Increasing \f[C]\-\-s3\-upload\-concurrency\f[R] will increase
throughput (8 would be a sensible value) and increasing
\f[C]\-\-s3\-chunk\-size\f[R] also increases throughput (16M would be
sensible).
Increasing either of these will use more memory.
The default values are high enough to gain most of the possible
performance without using too much memory.
.SS Buckets and Regions
.PP
With Amazon S3 you can list buckets (\f[C]rclone lsd\f[R]) using any
region, but you can only access the content of a bucket from the region
it was created in.
If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong region, you will get an
error,
\f[C]incorrect region, the bucket is not in \[aq]XXX\[aq] region\f[R].
.SS Authentication
.PP
There are a number of ways to supply \f[C]rclone\f[R] with a set of AWS
credentials, with and without using the environment.
.PP
The different authentication methods are tried in this order:
.IP \[bu] 2
Directly in the rclone configuration file (\f[C]env_auth = false\f[R] in
the config file):
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]access_key_id\f[R] and \f[C]secret_access_key\f[R] are required.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]session_token\f[R] can be optionally set when using AWS STS.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Runtime configuration (\f[C]env_auth = true\f[R] in the config file):
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
Export the following environment variables before running
\f[C]rclone\f[R]:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
Access Key ID: \f[C]AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\f[R] or \f[C]AWS_ACCESS_KEY\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Secret Access Key: \f[C]AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\f[R] or
\f[C]AWS_SECRET_KEY\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Session Token: \f[C]AWS_SESSION_TOKEN\f[R] (optional)
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Or, use a named
profile (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html):
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
Profile files are standard files used by AWS CLI tools
.IP \[bu] 2
By default it will use the profile in your home directory (eg
\f[C]\[ti]/.aws/credentials\f[R] on unix based systems) file and the
\[lq]default\[rq] profile, to change set these environment variables:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE\f[R] to control which file.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]AWS_PROFILE\f[R] to control which profile to use.
.RE
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Or, run \f[C]rclone\f[R] in an ECS task with an IAM role (AWS only).
.IP \[bu] 2
Or, run \f[C]rclone\f[R] on an EC2 instance with an IAM role (AWS only).
.IP \[bu] 2
Or, run \f[C]rclone\f[R] in an EKS pod with an IAM role that is
associated with a service account (AWS only).
.RE
.PP
If none of these option actually end up providing \f[C]rclone\f[R] with
AWS credentials then S3 interaction will be non\-authenticated (see
below).
.SS S3 Permissions
.PP
When using the \f[C]sync\f[R] subcommand of \f[C]rclone\f[R] the
following minimum permissions are required to be available on the bucket
being written to:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]ListBucket\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]DeleteObject\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]GetObject\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]PutObject\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]PutObjectACL\f[R]
.PP
When using the \f[C]lsd\f[R] subcommand, the \f[C]ListAllMyBuckets\f[R]
permission is required.
.PP
Example policy:

.PP
Notes on above:
.IP "1." 3
This is a policy that can be used when creating bucket.
It assumes that \f[C]USER_NAME\f[R] has been created.
.IP "2." 3
The Resource entry must include both resource ARNs, as one implies the
bucket and the other implies the bucket\[cq]s objects.
.PP
For reference, here\[cq]s an Ansible
script (https://gist.github.com/ebridges/ebfc9042dd7c756cd101cfa807b7ae2b)
that will generate one or more buckets that will work with
\f[C]rclone sync\f[R].
.SS Key Management System (KMS)
.PP
If you are using server side encryption with KMS then you will find you
can\[cq]t transfer small objects.
As a work\-around you can use the \f[C]\-\-ignore\-checksum\f[R] flag.
.PP
A proper fix is being worked on in issue
#1824 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1824).
.SS Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive
.PP
You can upload objects using the glacier storage class or transition
them to glacier using a lifecycle
policy (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-lifecycle.html).
The bucket can still be synced or copied into normally, but if rclone
tries to access data from the glacier storage class you will see an
error like below.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
2017/09/11 19:07:43 Failed to sync: failed to open source object: Object in GLACIER, restore first: path/to/file
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In this case you need to
restore (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/restore-archived-objects.html)
the object(s) in question before using rclone.
.PP
Note that rclone only speaks the S3 API it does not speak the Glacier
Vault API, so rclone cannot directly access Glacier Vaults.

Chunk size to use for uploading.
.PP
When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff or files with unknown
size (eg from \[lq]rclone rcat\[rq] or uploaded with \[lq]rclone

.PP
If you are transferring large files over high speed links and you have
enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.
.PP
Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a large
file of known size to stay below the 10,000 chunks limit.
.PP
Files of unknown size are uploaded with the configured chunk_size.
Since the default chunk size is 5MB and there can be at most 10,000
chunks, this means that by default the maximum size of file you can

.SS Anonymous access to public buckets
.PP
If you want to use rclone to access a public bucket, configure with a
blank \f[C]access_key_id\f[R] and \f[C]secret_access_key\f[R].
Your config should end up looking like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[anons3]
type = s3
provider = AWS
env_auth = false
access_key_id = 
secret_access_key = 
region = us\-east\-1
endpoint = 
location_constraint = 
acl = private
server_side_encryption = 
storage_class = 
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then use it as normal with the name of the public bucket, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd anons3:1000genomes
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You will be able to list and copy data but not upload it.
.SS Ceph
.PP
Ceph (https://ceph.com/) is an open source unified, distributed storage
system designed for excellent performance, reliability and scalability.
It has an S3 compatible object storage interface.
.PP
To use rclone with Ceph, configure as above but leave the region blank
and set the endpoint.
You should end up with something like this in your config:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[ceph]
type = s3
provider = Ceph
env_auth = false
access_key_id = XXX
secret_access_key = YYY
region =
endpoint = https://ceph.endpoint.example.com
location_constraint =
acl =
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you are using an older version of CEPH, eg 10.2.x Jewel, then you may
need to supply the parameter \f[C]\-\-s3\-upload\-cutoff 0\f[R] or put
this in the config file as \f[C]upload_cutoff 0\f[R] to work around a
bug which causes uploading of small files to fail.
.PP
Note also that Ceph sometimes puts \f[C]/\f[R] in the passwords it gives
users.
If you read the secret access key using the command line tools you will
get a JSON blob with the \f[C]/\f[R] escaped as \f[C]\[rs]/\f[R].
Make sure you only write \f[C]/\f[R] in the secret access key.
.PP
Eg the dump from Ceph looks something like this (irrelevant keys
removed).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]user_id\[dq]: \[dq]xxx\[dq],
    \[dq]display_name\[dq]: \[dq]xxxx\[dq],
    \[dq]keys\[dq]: [
        {
            \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]xxx\[dq],
            \[dq]access_key\[dq]: \[dq]xxxxxx\[dq],
            \[dq]secret_key\[dq]: \[dq]xxxxxx\[rs]/xxxx\[dq]
        }
    ],
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Because this is a json dump, it is encoding the \f[C]/\f[R] as
\f[C]\[rs]/\f[R], so if you use the secret key as \f[C]xxxxxx/xxxx\f[R]
it will work fine.
.SS Dreamhost
.PP
Dreamhost DreamObjects (https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/) is an
object storage system based on CEPH.
.PP
To use rclone with Dreamhost, configure as above but leave the region
blank and set the endpoint.
You should end up with something like this in your config:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[dreamobjects]
type = s3
provider = DreamHost
env_auth = false
access_key_id = your_access_key
secret_access_key = your_secret_key
region =
endpoint = objects\-us\-west\-1.dream.io
location_constraint =
acl = private
server_side_encryption =

\f[R]
.fi
.SS DigitalOcean Spaces
.PP
Spaces (https://www.digitalocean.com/products/object-storage/) is an
S3\-interoperable (https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/spaces/)
object storage service from cloud provider DigitalOcean.
.PP
To connect to DigitalOcean Spaces you will need an access key and secret
key.
These can be retrieved on the \[lq]Applications &
API (https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/api/tokens)\[rq] page of
the DigitalOcean control panel.
They will be needed when prompted by \f[C]rclone config\f[R] for your
\f[C]access_key_id\f[R] and \f[C]secret_access_key\f[R].
.PP
When prompted for a \f[C]region\f[R] or \f[C]location_constraint\f[R],
press enter to use the default value.
The region must be included in the \f[C]endpoint\f[R] setting
(e.g.\ \f[C]nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\f[R]).
The default values can be used for other settings.
.PP
Going through the whole process of creating a new remote by running
\f[C]rclone config\f[R], each prompt should be answered as shown below:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Storage> s3
env_auth> 1
access_key_id> YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key> YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region>
endpoint> nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
location_constraint>
acl>
storage_class>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The resulting configuration file should look like:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[spaces]
type = s3
provider = DigitalOcean
env_auth = false
access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region =
endpoint = nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
location_constraint =
acl =
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Once configured, you can create a new Space and begin copying files.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone mkdir spaces:my\-new\-space
rclone copy /path/to/files spaces:my\-new\-space

.SS Application Keys
.PP
B2 supports multiple Application Keys for different access permission to
B2 Buckets (https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/application_keys.html).
.PP
You can use these with rclone too; you will need to use rclone version
1.43 or later.
.PP
Follow Backblaze\[cq]s docs to create an Application Key with the
required permission and add the \f[C]applicationKeyId\f[R] as the
\f[C]account\f[R] and the \f[C]Application Key\f[R] itself as the
\f[C]key\f[R].
.PP
Note that you must put the \f[I]applicationKeyId\f[R] as the
\f[C]account\f[R] \[en] you can\[cq]t use the master Account ID.
If you try then B2 will return 401 errors.
.SS \[en]fast\-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R] which allows you to use
fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X\-Bz\-Info\-src_last_modified_millis\f[R] as milliseconds since
1970\-01\-01 in the Backblaze standard.
Other tools should be able to use this as a modified time.
.PP
Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported.
Note that if a modification time needs to be updated on an object then
it will create a new version of the object.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
In addition to the default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters) the following
characters are also replaced:
.PP
.TS
tab(@);

.TE
.PP
Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[cq]t
be used in JSON strings.
.SS SHA1 checksums
.PP
The SHA1 checksums of the files are checked on upload and download and
will be used in the syncing process.
.PP
Large files (bigger than the limit in \f[C]\-\-b2\-upload\-cutoff\f[R])
which are uploaded in chunks will store their SHA1 on the object as
\f[C]X\-Bz\-Info\-large_file_sha1\f[R] as recommended by Backblaze.
.PP
For a large file to be uploaded with an SHA1 checksum, the source needs
to support SHA1 checksums.
The local disk supports SHA1 checksums so large file transfers from
local disk will have an SHA1.
See the overview (https://rclone.org/overview/#features) for exactly
which remotes support SHA1.
.PP
Sources which don\[cq]t support SHA1, in particular \f[C]crypt\f[R] will
upload large files without SHA1 checksums.
This may be fixed in the future (see
#1767 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1767)).
.PP
Files sizes below \f[C]\-\-b2\-upload\-cutoff\f[R] will always have an
SHA1 regardless of the source.
.SS Transfers
.PP
Backblaze recommends that you do lots of transfers simultaneously for
maximum speed.
In tests from my SSD equipped laptop the optimum setting is about
\f[C]\-\-transfers 32\f[R] though higher numbers may be used for a
slight speed improvement.
The optimum number for you may vary depending on your hardware, how big
the files are, how much you want to load your computer, etc.
The default of \f[C]\-\-transfers 4\f[R] is definitely too low for
Backblaze B2 though.
.PP
Note that uploading big files (bigger than 200 MB by default) will use a
96 MB RAM buffer by default.
There can be at most \f[C]\-\-transfers\f[R] of these in use at any
moment, so this sets the upper limit on the memory used.
.SS Versions
.PP
When rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a new version of
it (https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/file_versions.html).
Likewise when you delete a file, the old version will be marked hidden
and still be available.
Conversely, you may opt in to a \[lq]hard delete\[rq] of files with the
\f[C]\-\-b2\-hard\-delete\f[R] flag which would permanently remove the
file instead of hiding it.
.PP
Old versions of files, where available, are visible using the
\f[C]\-\-b2\-versions\f[R] flag.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] Note that \f[C]\-\-b2\-versions\f[R] does not work with
crypt at the moment
#1627 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1627).
Using \[en]backup\-dir (https://rclone.org/docs/#backup-dir-dir) with
rclone is the recommended way of working around this.
.PP
If you wish to remove all the old versions then you can use the
\f[C]rclone cleanup remote:bucket\f[R] command which will delete all the
old versions of files, leaving the current ones intact.
You can also supply a path and only old versions under that path will be
deleted, eg \f[C]rclone cleanup remote:bucket/path/to/stuff\f[R].
.PP
Note that \f[C]cleanup\f[R] will remove partially uploaded files from
the bucket if they are more than a day old.
.PP
When you \f[C]purge\f[R] a bucket, the current and the old versions will
be deleted then the bucket will be deleted.
.PP
However \f[C]delete\f[R] will cause the current versions of the files to
become hidden old versions.
.PP
Here is a session showing the listing and retrieval of an old version
followed by a \f[C]cleanup\f[R] of the old versions.
.PP
Show current version and all the versions with
\f[C]\-\-b2\-versions\f[R] flag.

.SS Data usage
.PP
It is useful to know how many requests are sent to the server in
different scenarios.
.PP
All copy commands send the following 4 requests:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/b2api/v1/b2_authorize_account
/b2api/v1/b2_create_bucket
/b2api/v1/b2_list_buckets
/b2api/v1/b2_list_file_names
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The \f[C]b2_list_file_names\f[R] request will be sent once for every 1k
files in the remote path, providing the checksum and modification time
of the listed files.
As of version 1.33 issue
#818 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/818) causes extra requests
to be sent when using B2 with Crypt.
When a copy operation does not require any files to be uploaded, no more
requests will be sent.
.PP
Uploading files that do not require chunking, will send 2 requests per
file upload:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_url
/b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Uploading files requiring chunking, will send 2 requests (one each to
start and finish the upload) and another 2 requests for each chunk:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/b2api/v1/b2_start_large_file
/b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_part_url
/b2api/v1/b2_upload_part/
/b2api/v1/b2_finish_large_file
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Versions
.PP
Versions can be viewed with the \f[C]\-\-b2\-versions\f[R] flag.
When it is set rclone will show and act on older versions of files.
For example
.PP
Listing without \f[C]\-\-b2\-versions\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone \-q ls b2:cleanup\-test
        9 one.txt
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And with
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone \-q \-\-b2\-versions ls b2:cleanup\-test
        9 one.txt
        8 one\-v2016\-07\-04\-141032\-000.txt
       16 one\-v2016\-07\-04\-141003\-000.txt
       15 one\-v2016\-07\-02\-155621\-000.txt
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Showing that the current version is unchanged but older versions can be
seen.
These have the UTC date that they were uploaded to the server to the
nearest millisecond appended to them.
.PP
Note that when using \f[C]\-\-b2\-versions\f[R] no file write operations
are permitted, so you can\[cq]t upload files or delete them.
.SS B2 and rclone link
.PP
Rclone supports generating file share links for private B2 buckets.
They can either be for a file for example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\&./rclone link B2:bucket/path/to/file.txt
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file.txt?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
or if run on a directory you will get:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\&./rclone link B2:bucket/path
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
you can then use the authorization token (the part of the url from the
\f[C]?Authorization=\f[R] on) on any file path under that directory.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file1?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/file2?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/folder/file3?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
\f[R]

.SS Box
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[R]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.PP
The initial setup for Box involves getting a token from Box which you
can do either in your browser, or with a config.json downloaded from Box
to use JWT authentication.
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] walks you through it.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[R].
First run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
 rclone config
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

\f[R]
.fi
.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Box.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[R] like this,
.PP
List directories in top level of your Box
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd remote:
\f[R]

\f[R]
.fi
.SS Using rclone with an Enterprise account with SSO
.PP
If you have an \[lq]Enterprise\[rq] account type with Box with single
sign on (SSO), you need to create a password to use Box with rclone.
This can be done at your Enterprise Box account by going to Settings,
\[lq]Account\[rq] Tab, and then set the password in the
\[lq]Authentication\[rq] field.
.PP
Once you have done this, you can setup your Enterprise Box account using
the same procedure detailed above in the, using the password you have
just set.
.SS Invalid refresh token
.PP
According to the box
docs (https://developer.box.com/v2.0/docs/oauth-20#section-6-using-the-access-and-refresh-tokens):
.RS
.PP
Each refresh_token is valid for one use in 60 days.
.RE
.PP
This means that if you
.IP \[bu] 2
Don\[cq]t use the box remote for 60 days
.IP \[bu] 2
Copy the config file with a box refresh token in and use it in two
places
.IP \[bu] 2
Get an error on a token refresh
.PP
then rclone will return an error which includes the text
\f[C]Invalid refresh token\f[R].
.PP
To fix this you will need to use oauth2 again to update the refresh
token.
You can use the methods in the remote setup
docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/), bearing in mind that if you use
the copy the config file method, you should not use that remote on the
computer you did the authentication on.
.PP
Here is how to do it.

.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
Box allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1 second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
.PP
Box supports SHA1 type hashes, so you can use the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[R]
flag.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
In addition to the default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters) the following
characters are also replaced:
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
l c c.
T{

T}
_
T{

.PP
File names can also not end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the last character in the name:
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
l c c.
T{

T}@T{
Replacement
T}
_
T{
SP
T}@T{
0x20
T}@T{
\[u2420]
T}
.TE
.PP
Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[cq]t
be used in JSON strings.
.SS Transfers
.PP
For files above 50MB rclone will use a chunked transfer.
Rclone will upload up to \f[C]\-\-transfers\f[R] chunks at the same time
(shared among all the multipart uploads).
Chunks are buffered in memory and are normally 8MB so increasing
\f[C]\-\-transfers\f[R] will increase memory use.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Depending on the enterprise settings for your user, the item will either
be actually deleted from Box or moved to the trash.
.SS Root folder ID
.PP
You can set the \f[C]root_folder_id\f[R] for rclone.
This is the directory (identified by its \f[C]Folder ID\f[R]) that
rclone considers to be the root of your Box drive.
.PP
Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct
root to use itself.
.PP
However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.
.PP
In order to do this you will have to find the \f[C]Folder ID\f[R] of the
directory you wish rclone to display.
This will be the last segment of the URL when you open the relevant
folder in the Box web interface.
.PP
So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
\f[C]https://app.box.com/folder/11xxxxxxxxx8\f[R] in the browser, then
you use \f[C]11xxxxxxxxx8\f[R] as the \f[C]root_folder_id\f[R] in the
config.

.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Box is case insensitive so you can\[cq]t have a file called
\[lq]Hello.doc\[rq] and one called \[lq]hello.doc\[rq].
.PP
Box file names can\[cq]t have the \f[C]\[rs]\f[R] character in.
rclone maps this to and from an identical looking unicode equivalent
\f[C]\[uFF3C]\f[R].
.PP
Box only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.
.SS Cache (BETA)
.PP
The \f[C]cache\f[R] remote wraps another existing remote and stores file
structure and its data for long running tasks like
\f[C]rclone mount\f[R].
.SS Status
.PP
The cache backend code is working but it currently doesn\[cq]t have a
maintainer so there are outstanding
bugs (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+label%3A%22Remote%3A+Cache%22)
which aren\[cq]t getting fixed.
.PP
The cache backend is due to be phased out in favour of the VFS caching
layer eventually which is more tightly integrated into rclone.
.PP
Until this happens we recommend only using the cache backend if you find
you can\[cq]t work without it.
There are many docs online describing the use of the cache backend to
minimize API hits and by\-and\-large these are out of date and the cache
backend isn\[cq]t needed in those scenarios any more.
.SS Setup
.PP
To get started you just need to have an existing remote which can be
configured with \f[C]cache\f[R].
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]test\-cache\f[R].
First run:
.IP

.SS Write Features
.SS Offline uploading
.PP
In an effort to make writing through cache more reliable, the backend
now supports this feature which can be activated by specifying a
\f[C]cache\-tmp\-upload\-path\f[R].
.PP
A files goes through these states when using this feature:
.IP "1." 3
An upload is started (usually by copying a file on the cache remote)
.IP "2." 3
When the copy to the temporary location is complete the file is part of
the cached remote and looks and behaves like any other file (reading
included)
.IP "3." 3
After \f[C]cache\-tmp\-wait\-time\f[R] passes and the file is next in
line, \f[C]rclone move\f[R] is used to move the file to the cloud
provider
.IP "4." 3
Reading the file still works during the upload but most modifications on
it will be prohibited
.IP "5." 3
Once the move is complete the file is unlocked for modifications as it
becomes as any other regular file
.IP "6." 3
If the file is being read through \f[C]cache\f[R] when it\[cq]s actually
deleted from the temporary path then \f[C]cache\f[R] will simply swap
the source to the cloud provider without interrupting the reading (small
blip can happen though)
.PP
Files are uploaded in sequence and only one file is uploaded at a time.
Uploads will be stored in a queue and be processed based on the order
they were added.
The queue and the temporary storage is persistent across restarts but
can be cleared on startup with the \f[C]\-\-cache\-db\-purge\f[R] flag.
.SS Write Support
.PP
Writes are supported through \f[C]cache\f[R].
One caveat is that a mounted cache remote does not add any retry or
fallback mechanism to the upload operation.
This will depend on the implementation of the wrapped remote.
Consider using \f[C]Offline uploading\f[R] for reliable writes.
.PP
One special case is covered with \f[C]cache\-writes\f[R] which will
cache the file data at the same time as the upload when it is enabled
making it available from the cache store immediately once the upload is
finished.
.SS Read Features
.SS Multiple connections
.PP
To counter the high latency between a local PC where rclone is running
and cloud providers, the cache remote can split multiple requests to the
cloud provider for smaller file chunks and combines them together
locally where they can be available almost immediately before the reader
usually needs them.
.PP
This is similar to buffering when media files are played online.
Rclone will stay around the current marker but always try its best to
stay ahead and prepare the data before.
.SS Plex Integration
.PP
There is a direct integration with Plex which allows cache to detect
during reading if the file is in playback or not.
This helps cache to adapt how it queries the cloud provider depending on
what is needed for.
.PP
Scans will have a minimum amount of workers (1) while in a confirmed
playback cache will deploy the configured number of workers.
.PP
This integration opens the doorway to additional performance
improvements which will be explored in the near future.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] If Plex options are not configured, \f[C]cache\f[R] will
function with its configured options without adapting any of its
settings.
.PP
How to enable?
Run \f[C]rclone config\f[R] and add all the Plex options (endpoint,
username and password) in your remote and it will be automatically
enabled.
.PP
Affected settings: \- \f[C]cache\-workers\f[R]: \f[I]Configured
value\f[R] during confirmed playback or \f[I]1\f[R] all the other times
.SS Certificate Validation
.PP
When the Plex server is configured to only accept secure connections, it
is possible to use \f[C].plex.direct\f[R] URLs to ensure certificate
validation succeeds.
These URLs are used by Plex internally to connect to the Plex server
securely.
.PP
The format for these URLs is the following:
.PP
https://ip\-with\-dots\-replaced.server\-hash.plex.direct:32400/
.PP
The \f[C]ip\-with\-dots\-replaced\f[R] part can be any IPv4 address,
where the dots have been replaced with dashes, e.g.\ \f[C]127.0.0.1\f[R]
becomes \f[C]127\-0\-0\-1\f[R].
.PP
To get the \f[C]server\-hash\f[R] part, the easiest way is to visit
.PP
https://plex.tv/api/resources?includeHttps=1&X\-Plex\-Token=your\-plex\-token
.PP
This page will list all the available Plex servers for your account with
at least one \f[C].plex.direct\f[R] link for each.
Copy one URL and replace the IP address with the desired address.
This can be used as the \f[C]plex_url\f[R] value.
.SS Known issues
.SS Mount and \[en]dir\-cache\-time
.PP
\[en]dir\-cache\-time controls the first layer of directory caching
which works at the mount layer.
Being an independent caching mechanism from the \f[C]cache\f[R] backend,
it will manage its own entries based on the configured time.
.PP
To avoid getting in a scenario where dir cache has obsolete data and
cache would have the correct one, try to set
\f[C]\-\-dir\-cache\-time\f[R] to a lower time than
\f[C]\-\-cache\-info\-age\f[R].
Default values are already configured in this way.
.SS Windows support \- Experimental
.PP
There are a couple of issues with Windows \f[C]mount\f[R] functionality
that still require some investigations.
It should be considered as experimental thus far as fixes come in for
this OS.
.PP
Most of the issues seem to be related to the difference between
filesystems on Linux flavors and Windows as cache is heavily dependent
on them.
.PP
Any reports or feedback on how cache behaves on this OS is greatly
appreciated.

.SS Risk of throttling
.PP
Future iterations of the cache backend will make use of the pooling
functionality of the cloud provider to synchronize and at the same time
make writing through it more tolerant to failures.
.PP
There are a couple of enhancements in track to add these but in the
meantime there is a valid concern that the expiring cache listings can
lead to cloud provider throttles or bans due to repeated queries on it
for very large mounts.
.PP
Some recommendations: \- don\[cq]t use a very small interval for entry
information (\f[C]\-\-cache\-info\-age\f[R]) \- while writes aren\[cq]t
yet optimised, you can still write through \f[C]cache\f[R] which gives
you the advantage of adding the file in the cache at the same time if
configured to do so.
.PP
Future enhancements:

.SS cache and crypt
.PP
One common scenario is to keep your data encrypted in the cloud provider
using the \f[C]crypt\f[R] remote.
\f[C]crypt\f[R] uses a similar technique to wrap around an existing
remote and handles this translation in a seamless way.
.PP
There is an issue with wrapping the remotes in this order: \f[B]cloud
remote\f[R] \-> \f[B]crypt\f[R] \-> \f[B]cache\f[R]
.PP
During testing, I experienced a lot of bans with the remotes in this
order.
I suspect it might be related to how crypt opens files on the cloud
provider which makes it think we\[cq]re downloading the full file
instead of small chunks.
Organizing the remotes in this order yields better results: \f[B]cloud
remote\f[R] \-> \f[B]cache\f[R] \-> \f[B]crypt\f[R]
.SS absolute remote paths
.PP
\f[C]cache\f[R] can not differentiate between relative and absolute
paths for the wrapped remote.
Any path given in the \f[C]remote\f[R] config setting and on the command
line will be passed to the wrapped remote as is, but for storing the
chunks on disk the path will be made relative by removing any leading
\f[C]/\f[R] character.
.PP
This behavior is irrelevant for most backend types, but there are
backends where a leading \f[C]/\f[R] changes the effective directory,
e.g.\ in the \f[C]sftp\f[R] backend paths starting with a \f[C]/\f[R]
are relative to the root of the SSH server and paths without are
relative to the user home directory.
As a result \f[C]sftp:bin\f[R] and \f[C]sftp:/bin\f[R] will share the
same cache folder, even if they represent a different directory on the
SSH server.
.SS Cache and Remote Control (\[en]rc)
.PP
Cache supports the new \f[C]\-\-rc\f[R] mode in rclone and can be remote
controlled through the following end points: By default, the listener is
disabled if you do not add the flag.
.SS rc cache/expire
.PP
Purge a remote from the cache backend.
Supports either a directory or a file.
It supports both encrypted and unencrypted file names if cache is
wrapped by crypt.
.PP

\f[B]withData\f[R] = true/false to delete cached data (chunks) as well

Since reading from a cache stream is independent from downloading file
data, readers can get to a point where there\[cq]s no more data in the
cache.
Most of the times this can indicate a connectivity issue if cache
isn\[cq]t able to provide file data anymore.

For really slow connections, increase this to a point where the stream
is able to provide data but your experience will be very stuttering.

.SS \[en]cache\-workers
.PP
How many workers should run in parallel to download chunks.
.PP
Higher values will mean more parallel processing (better CPU needed) and
more concurrent requests on the cloud provider.
This impacts several aspects like the cloud provider API limits, more
stress on the hardware that rclone runs on but it also means that
streams will be more fluid and data will be available much more faster
to readers.

By default, cache will keep file data during streaming in RAM as well to
provide it to readers as fast as possible.
.PP
This transient data is evicted as soon as it is read and the number of
chunks stored doesn\[cq]t exceed the number of workers.
However, depending on other settings like \[lq]cache\-chunk\-size\[rq]
and \[lq]cache\-workers\[rq] this footprint can increase if there are
parallel streams too (multiple files being read at the same time).
.PP
If the hardware permits it, use this feature to provide an overall
better performance during streaming but it can also be disabled if RAM
is not available on the local machine.

.PP
This setting places a hard limit on the number of requests per second
that cache will be doing to the cloud provider remote and try to respect
that value by setting waits between reads.
.PP
If you find that you\[cq]re getting banned or limited on the cloud
provider through cache and know that a smaller number of requests per
second will allow you to work with it then you can use this setting for
that.
.PP
A good balance of all the other settings should make this setting
useless but it is available to set for more special cases.

.SS Chunker (BETA)
.PP
The \f[C]chunker\f[R] overlay transparently splits large files into
smaller chunks during upload to wrapped remote and transparently
assembles them back when the file is downloaded.
This allows to effectively overcome size limits imposed by storage
providers.
.PP
To use it, first set up the underlying remote following the
configuration instructions for that remote.
You can also use a local pathname instead of a remote.
.PP
First check your chosen remote is working \- we\[cq]ll call it
\f[C]remote:path\f[R] here.
Note that anything inside \f[C]remote:path\f[R] will be chunked and
anything outside won\[cq]t.
This means that if you are using a bucket based remote (eg S3, B2,
swift) then you should probably put the bucket in the remote
\f[C]s3:bucket\f[R].
.PP
Now configure \f[C]chunker\f[R] using \f[C]rclone config\f[R].
We will call this one \f[C]overlay\f[R] to separate it from the
\f[C]remote\f[R] itself.

.SS Specifying the remote
.PP
In normal use, make sure the remote has a \f[C]:\f[R] in.
If you specify the remote without a \f[C]:\f[R] then rclone will use a
local directory of that name.
So if you use a remote of \f[C]/path/to/secret/files\f[R] then rclone
will chunk stuff in that directory.
If you use a remote of \f[C]name\f[R] then rclone will put files in a
directory called \f[C]name\f[R] in the current directory.
.SS Chunking
.PP
When rclone starts a file upload, chunker checks the file size.
If it doesn\[cq]t exceed the configured chunk size, chunker will just
pass the file to the wrapped remote.
If a file is large, chunker will transparently cut data in pieces with
temporary names and stream them one by one, on the fly.
Each data chunk will contain the specified number of bytes, except for
the last one which may have less data.
If file size is unknown in advance (this is called a streaming upload),
chunker will internally create a temporary copy, record its size and
repeat the above process.
.PP
When upload completes, temporary chunk files are finally renamed.
This scheme guarantees that operations can be run in parallel and look
from outside as atomic.
A similar method with hidden temporary chunks is used for other
operations (copy/move/rename etc).
If an operation fails, hidden chunks are normally destroyed, and the
target composite file stays intact.
.PP
When a composite file download is requested, chunker transparently
assembles it by concatenating data chunks in order.
As the split is trivial one could even manually concatenate data chunks
together to obtain the original content.
.PP
When the \f[C]list\f[R] rclone command scans a directory on wrapped
remote, the potential chunk files are accounted for, grouped and
assembled into composite directory entries.
Any temporary chunks are hidden.
.PP
List and other commands can sometimes come across composite files with
missing or invalid chunks, eg.
shadowed by like\-named directory or another file.
This usually means that wrapped file system has been directly tampered
with or damaged.
If chunker detects a missing chunk it will by default print warning,
skip the whole incomplete group of chunks but proceed with current
command.
You can set the \f[C]\-\-chunker\-fail\-hard\f[R] flag to have commands
abort with error message in such cases.
.SS Chunk names
.PP
The default chunk name format is \f[C]*.rclone_chunk.###\f[R], hence by
default chunk names are \f[C]BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.001\f[R],
\f[C]BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.002\f[R] etc.
You can configure another name format using the \f[C]name_format\f[R]
configuration file option.
The format uses asterisk \f[C]*\f[R] as a placeholder for the base file
name and one or more consecutive hash characters \f[C]#\f[R] as a
placeholder for sequential chunk number.
There must be one and only one asterisk.
The number of consecutive hash characters defines the minimum length of
a string representing a chunk number.
If decimal chunk number has less digits than the number of hashes, it is
left\-padded by zeros.
If the decimal string is longer, it is left intact.
By default numbering starts from 1 but there is another option that
allows user to start from 0, eg.
for compatibility with legacy software.
.PP
For example, if name format is \f[C]big_*\-##.part\f[R] and original
file name is \f[C]data.txt\f[R] and numbering starts from 0, then the
first chunk will be named \f[C]big_data.txt\-00.part\f[R], the 99th
chunk will be \f[C]big_data.txt\-98.part\f[R] and the 302nd chunk will
become \f[C]big_data.txt\-301.part\f[R].
.PP
Note that \f[C]list\f[R] assembles composite directory entries only when
chunk names match the configured format and treats non\-conforming file
names as normal non\-chunked files.
.SS Metadata
.PP
Besides data chunks chunker will by default create metadata object for a
composite file.
The object is named after the original file.
Chunker allows user to disable metadata completely (the \f[C]none\f[R]
format).
Note that metadata is normally not created for files smaller than the
configured chunk size.
This may change in future rclone releases.
.SS Simple JSON metadata format
.PP
This is the default format.
It supports hash sums and chunk validation for composite files.
Meta objects carry the following fields:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]ver\f[R] \- version of format, currently \f[C]1\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]size\f[R] \- total size of composite file
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]nchunks\f[R] \- number of data chunks in file
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]md5\f[R] \- MD5 hashsum of composite file (if present)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]sha1\f[R] \- SHA1 hashsum (if present)
.PP
There is no field for composite file name as it\[cq]s simply equal to
the name of meta object on the wrapped remote.
Please refer to respective sections for details on hashsums and modified
time handling.
.SS No metadata
.PP
You can disable meta objects by setting the meta format option to
\f[C]none\f[R].
In this mode chunker will scan directory for all files that follow
configured chunk name format, group them by detecting chunks with the
same base name and show group names as virtual composite files.
This method is more prone to missing chunk errors (especially missing
last chunk) than format with metadata enabled.
.SS Hashsums
.PP
Chunker supports hashsums only when a compatible metadata is present.
Hence, if you choose metadata format of \f[C]none\f[R], chunker will
report hashsum as \f[C]UNSUPPORTED\f[R].
.PP
Please note that by default metadata is stored only for composite files.
If a file is smaller than configured chunk size, chunker will
transparently redirect hash requests to wrapped remote, so support
depends on that.
You will see the empty string as a hashsum of requested type for small
files if the wrapped remote doesn\[cq]t support it.
.PP
Many storage backends support MD5 and SHA1 hash types, so does chunker.
With chunker you can choose one or another but not both.
MD5 is set by default as the most supported type.
Since chunker keeps hashes for composite files and falls back to the
wrapped remote hash for non\-chunked ones, we advise you to choose the
same hash type as supported by wrapped remote so that your file listings
look coherent.
.PP
If your storage backend does not support MD5 or SHA1 but you need
consistent file hashing, configure chunker with \f[C]md5all\f[R] or
\f[C]sha1all\f[R].
These two modes guarantee given hash for all files.
If wrapped remote doesn\[cq]t support it, chunker will then add metadata
to all files, even small.
However, this can double the amount of small files in storage and incur
additional service charges.
You can even use chunker to force md5/sha1 support in any other remote
at expense of sidecar meta objects by setting eg.
\f[C]chunk_type=sha1all\f[R] to force hashsums and
\f[C]chunk_size=1P\f[R] to effectively disable chunking.
.PP
Normally, when a file is copied to chunker controlled remote, chunker
will ask the file source for compatible file hash and revert to
on\-the\-fly calculation if none is found.
This involves some CPU overhead but provides a guarantee that given
hashsum is available.
Also, chunker will reject a server\-side copy or move operation if
source and destination hashsum types are different resulting in the
extra network bandwidth, too.
In some rare cases this may be undesired, so chunker provides two
optional choices: \f[C]sha1quick\f[R] and \f[C]md5quick\f[R].
If the source does not support primary hash type and the quick mode is
enabled, chunker will try to fall back to the secondary type.
This will save CPU and bandwidth but can result in empty hashsums at
destination.
Beware of consequences: the \f[C]sync\f[R] command will revert
(sometimes silently) to time/size comparison if compatible hashsums
between source and target are not found.
.SS Modified time
.PP
Chunker stores modification times using the wrapped remote so support
depends on that.
For a small non\-chunked file the chunker overlay simply manipulates
modification time of the wrapped remote file.
For a composite file with metadata chunker will get and set modification
time of the metadata object on the wrapped remote.
If file is chunked but metadata format is \f[C]none\f[R] then chunker
will use modification time of the first data chunk.
.SS Migrations
.PP
The idiomatic way to migrate to a different chunk size, hash type or
chunk naming scheme is to:
.IP \[bu] 2
Collect all your chunked files under a directory and have your chunker
remote point to it.
.IP \[bu] 2
Create another directory (most probably on the same cloud storage) and
configure a new remote with desired metadata format, hash type, chunk
naming etc.
.IP \[bu] 2
Now run \f[C]rclone sync oldchunks: newchunks:\f[R] and all your data
will be transparently converted in transfer.
This may take some time, yet chunker will try server\-side copy if
possible.
.IP \[bu] 2
After checking data integrity you may remove configuration section of
the old remote.
.PP
If rclone gets killed during a long operation on a big composite file,
hidden temporary chunks may stay in the directory.
They will not be shown by the \f[C]list\f[R] command but will eat up
your account quota.
Please note that the \f[C]deletefile\f[R] command deletes only active
chunks of a file.
As a workaround, you can use remote of the wrapped file system to see
them.
An easy way to get rid of hidden garbage is to copy littered directory
somewhere using the chunker remote and purge the original directory.
The \f[C]copy\f[R] command will copy only active chunks while the
\f[C]purge\f[R] will remove everything including garbage.
.SS Caveats and Limitations
.PP
Chunker requires wrapped remote to support server side \f[C]move\f[R]
(or \f[C]copy\f[R] + \f[C]delete\f[R]) operations, otherwise it will
explicitly refuse to start.
This is because it internally renames temporary chunk files to their
final names when an operation completes successfully.
.PP
Chunker encodes chunk number in file name, so with default
\f[C]name_format\f[R] setting it adds 17 characters.
Also chunker adds 7 characters of temporary suffix during operations.
Many file systems limit base file name without path by 255 characters.
Using rclone\[cq]s crypt remote as a base file system limits file name
by 143 characters.
Thus, maximum name length is 231 for most files and 119 for
chunker\-over\-crypt.
A user in need can change name format to eg.
\f[C]*.rcc##\f[R] and save 10 characters (provided at most 99 chunks per
file).
.PP
Note that a move implemented using the copy\-and\-delete method may
incur double charging with some cloud storage providers.
.PP
Chunker will not automatically rename existing chunks when you run
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] on a live remote and change the chunk name
format.
Beware that in result of this some files which have been treated as
chunks before the change can pop up in directory listings as normal
files and vice versa.
The same warning holds for the chunk size.
If you desperately need to change critical chunking settings, you should
run data migration as described above.
.PP
If wrapped remote is case insensitive, the chunker overlay will inherit
that property (so you can\[cq]t have a file called \[lq]Hello.doc\[rq]
and \[lq]hello.doc\[rq] in the same directory).

.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Citrix ShareFile.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[R] like this,
.PP
List directories in top level of your ShareFile
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd remote:

.fi
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
ShareFile allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
.PP
ShareFile supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[R] flag.
.SS Transfers
.PP
For files above 128MB rclone will use a chunked transfer.
Rclone will upload up to \f[C]\-\-transfers\f[R] chunks at the same time
(shared among all the multipart uploads).
Chunks are buffered in memory and are normally 64MB so increasing
\f[C]\-\-transfers\f[R] will increase memory use.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that ShareFile is case insensitive so you can\[cq]t have a file
called \[lq]Hello.doc\[rq] and one called \[lq]hello.doc\[rq].
.PP
ShareFile only supports filenames up to 256 characters in length.

.SS Crypt
.PP
The \f[C]crypt\f[R] remote encrypts and decrypts another remote.
.PP
To use it first set up the underlying remote following the config
instructions for that remote.
You can also use a local pathname instead of a remote which will encrypt
and decrypt from that directory which might be useful for encrypting
onto a USB stick for example.
.PP
First check your chosen remote is working \- we\[cq]ll call it
\f[C]remote:path\f[R] in these docs.
Note that anything inside \f[C]remote:path\f[R] will be encrypted and
anything outside won\[cq]t.
This means that if you are using a bucket based remote (eg S3, B2,
swift) then you should probably put the bucket in the remote
\f[C]s3:bucket\f[R].
If you just use \f[C]s3:\f[R] then rclone will make encrypted bucket
names too (if using file name encryption) which may or may not be what
you want.
.PP
Now configure \f[C]crypt\f[R] using \f[C]rclone config\f[R].
We will call this one \f[C]secret\f[R] to differentiate it from the
\f[C]remote\f[R].

.PP
\f[B]Important\f[R] The password is stored in the config file is lightly
obscured so it isn\[cq]t immediately obvious what it is.
It is in no way secure unless you use config file encryption.
.PP
A long passphrase is recommended, or you can use a random one.
.PP
The obscured password is created by using AES\-CTR with a static key,
with the salt stored verbatim at the beginning of the obscured password.
This static key is shared by between all versions of rclone.
.PP
If you reconfigure rclone with the same passwords/passphrases elsewhere
it will be compatible, but the obscured version will be different due to
the different salt.
.PP
Note that rclone does not encrypt
.IP \[bu] 2
file length \- this can be calculated within 16 bytes
.IP \[bu] 2

.SS Specifying the remote
.PP
In normal use, make sure the remote has a \f[C]:\f[R] in.
If you specify the remote without a \f[C]:\f[R] then rclone will use a
local directory of that name.
So if you use a remote of \f[C]/path/to/secret/files\f[R] then rclone
will encrypt stuff to that directory.
If you use a remote of \f[C]name\f[R] then rclone will put files in a
directory called \f[C]name\f[R] in the current directory.
.PP
If you specify the remote as \f[C]remote:path/to/dir\f[R] then rclone
will store encrypted files in \f[C]path/to/dir\f[R] on the remote.
If you are using file name encryption, then when you save files to
\f[C]secret:subdir/subfile\f[R] this will store them in the unencrypted
path \f[C]path/to/dir\f[R] but the \f[C]subdir/subpath\f[R] bit will be
encrypted.
.PP
Note that unless you want encrypted bucket names (which are difficult to
manage because you won\[cq]t know what directory they represent in web
interfaces etc), you should probably specify a bucket, eg
\f[C]remote:secretbucket\f[R] when using bucket based remotes such as
S3, Swift, Hubic, B2, GCS.

.SS File name encryption modes
.PP
Here are some of the features of the file name encryption modes
.PP
Off
.IP \[bu] 2
doesn\[cq]t hide file names or directory structure
.IP \[bu] 2
allows for longer file names (\[ti]246 characters)
.IP \[bu] 2
can use sub paths and copy single files
.PP
Standard
.IP \[bu] 2
file names encrypted
.IP \[bu] 2
file names can\[cq]t be as long (\[ti]143 characters)
.IP \[bu] 2
can use sub paths and copy single files
.IP \[bu] 2
directory structure visible
.IP \[bu] 2
identical files names will have identical uploaded names
.IP \[bu] 2
can use shortcuts to shorten the directory recursion
.PP
Obfuscation
.PP
This is a simple \[lq]rotate\[rq] of the filename, with each file having
a rot distance based on the filename.
We store the distance at the beginning of the filename.
So a file called \[lq]hello\[rq] may become \[lq]53.jgnnq\[rq].
.PP
This is not a strong encryption of filenames, but it may stop automated
scanning tools from picking up on filename patterns.
As such it\[cq]s an intermediate between \[lq]off\[rq] and
\[lq]standard\[rq].
The advantage is that it allows for longer path segment names.
.PP
There is a possibility with some unicode based filenames that the
obfuscation is weak and may map lower case characters to upper case
equivalents.
You can not rely on this for strong protection.
.IP \[bu] 2
file names very lightly obfuscated
.IP \[bu] 2
file names can be longer than standard encryption
.IP \[bu] 2
can use sub paths and copy single files
.IP \[bu] 2
directory structure visible
.IP \[bu] 2
identical files names will have identical uploaded names
.PP
Cloud storage systems have various limits on file name length and total
path length which you are more likely to hit using \[lq]Standard\[rq]
file name encryption.
If you keep your file names to below 156 characters in length then you
should be OK on all providers.
.PP
There may be an even more secure file name encryption mode in the future
which will address the long file name problem.
.SS Directory name encryption
.PP
Crypt offers the option of encrypting dir names or leaving them intact.
There are two options:
.PP
True
.PP
Encrypts the whole file path including directory names Example:
\f[C]1/12/123.txt\f[R] is encrypted to
\f[C]p0e52nreeaj0a5ea7s64m4j72s/l42g6771hnv3an9cgc8cr2n1ng/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0\f[R]
.PP
False
.PP
Only encrypts file names, skips directory names Example:
\f[C]1/12/123.txt\f[R] is encrypted to
\f[C]1/12/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0\f[R]
.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
Crypt stores modification times using the underlying remote so support
depends on that.
.PP
Hashes are not stored for crypt.
However the data integrity is protected by an extremely strong crypto
authenticator.
.PP
Note that you should use the \f[C]rclone cryptcheck\f[R] command to
check the integrity of a crypted remote instead of
\f[C]rclone check\f[R] which can\[cq]t check the checksums properly.

.SS Backing up a crypted remote
.PP
If you wish to backup a crypted remote, it is recommended that you use
\f[C]rclone sync\f[R] on the encrypted files, and make sure the
passwords are the same in the new encrypted remote.
.PP
This will have the following advantages
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]rclone sync\f[R] will check the checksums while copying
.IP \[bu] 2
you can use \f[C]rclone check\f[R] between the encrypted remotes
.IP \[bu] 2
you don\[cq]t decrypt and encrypt unnecessarily
.PP
For example, let\[cq]s say you have your original remote at
\f[C]remote:\f[R] with the encrypted version at \f[C]eremote:\f[R] with
path \f[C]remote:crypt\f[R].
You would then set up the new remote \f[C]remote2:\f[R] and then the
encrypted version \f[C]eremote2:\f[R] with path \f[C]remote2:crypt\f[R]
using the same passwords as \f[C]eremote:\f[R].
.PP
To sync the two remotes you would do
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync remote:crypt remote2:crypt
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And to check the integrity you would do
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone check remote:crypt remote2:crypt
\f[R]
.fi
.SS File formats
.SS File encryption
.PP
Files are encrypted 1:1 source file to destination object.
The file has a header and is divided into chunks.
.SS Header
.IP \[bu] 2
8 bytes magic string \f[C]RCLONE\[rs]x00\[rs]x00\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
24 bytes Nonce (IV)
.PP
The initial nonce is generated from the operating systems crypto strong
random number generator.
The nonce is incremented for each chunk read making sure each nonce is
unique for each block written.
The chance of a nonce being re\-used is minuscule.
If you wrote an exabyte of data (10\[S1]\[u2078] bytes) you would have a
probability of approximately 2\[tmu]10\[u207B]\[S3]\[S2] of re\-using a
nonce.
.SS Chunk
.PP
Each chunk will contain 64kB of data, except for the last one which may
have less data.
The data chunk is in standard NACL secretbox format.
Secretbox uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate
messages.
.PP
Each chunk contains:
.IP \[bu] 2
16 Bytes of Poly1305 authenticator
.IP \[bu] 2
1 \- 65536 bytes XSalsa20 encrypted data
.PP
64k chunk size was chosen as the best performing chunk size (the
authenticator takes too much time below this and the performance drops
off due to cache effects above this).
Note that these chunks are buffered in memory so they can\[cq]t be too
big.
.PP
This uses a 32 byte (256 bit key) key derived from the user password.
.SS Examples
.PP
1 byte file will encrypt to
.IP \[bu] 2
32 bytes header
.IP \[bu] 2
17 bytes data chunk
.PP
49 bytes total
.PP
1MB (1048576 bytes) file will encrypt to
.IP \[bu] 2
32 bytes header
.IP \[bu] 2
16 chunks of 65568 bytes
.PP
1049120 bytes total (a 0.05% overhead).
This is the overhead for big files.
.SS Name encryption
.PP
File names are encrypted segment by segment \- the path is broken up
into \f[C]/\f[R] separated strings and these are encrypted individually.
.PP
File segments are padded using PKCS#7 to a multiple of 16 bytes before
encryption.
.PP
They are then encrypted with EME using AES with 256 bit key.
EME (ECB\-Mix\-ECB) is a wide\-block encryption mode presented in the
2003 paper \[lq]A Parallelizable Enciphering Mode\[rq] by Halevi and
Rogaway.
.PP
This makes for deterministic encryption which is what we want \- the
same filename must encrypt to the same thing otherwise we can\[cq]t find
it on the cloud storage system.
.PP
This means that
.IP \[bu] 2
filenames with the same name will encrypt the same
.IP \[bu] 2
filenames which start the same won\[cq]t have a common prefix
.PP
This uses a 32 byte key (256 bits) and a 16 byte (128 bits) IV both of
which are derived from the user password.
.PP
After encryption they are written out using a modified version of
standard \f[C]base32\f[R] encoding as described in RFC4648.
The standard encoding is modified in two ways:

it becomes lower case (no\-one likes upper case filenames!)
.IP \[bu] 2
we strip the padding character \f[C]=\f[R]
.PP
\f[C]base32\f[R] is used rather than the more efficient \f[C]base64\f[R]
so rclone can be used on case insensitive remotes (eg Windows, Amazon
Drive).
.SS Key derivation
.PP
Rclone uses \f[C]scrypt\f[R] with parameters \f[C]N=16384, r=8, p=1\f[R]
with an optional user supplied salt (password2) to derive the 32+32+16 =
80 bytes of key material required.
If the user doesn\[cq]t supply a salt then rclone uses an internal one.
.PP
\f[C]scrypt\f[R] makes it impractical to mount a dictionary attack on
rclone encrypted data.
For full protection against this you should always use a salt.
.SS Dropbox
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[R]
.PP
Dropbox paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.PP
The initial setup for dropbox involves getting a token from Dropbox
which you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] walks you through it.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[R].
First run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
 rclone config
\f[R]

.PP
You can then use it like this,

.PP

.SS Dropbox for business
.PP
Rclone supports Dropbox for business and Team Folders.
.PP
When using Dropbox for business \f[C]remote:\f[R] and
\f[C]remote:path/to/file\f[R] will refer to your personal folder.
.PP
If you wish to see Team Folders you must use a leading \f[C]/\f[R] in
the path, so \f[C]rclone lsd remote:/\f[R] will refer to the root and
show you all Team Folders and your User Folder.
.PP
You can then use team folders like this \f[C]remote:/TeamFolder\f[R] and
\f[C]remote:/TeamFolder/path/to/file\f[R].
.PP
A leading \f[C]/\f[R] for a Dropbox personal account will do nothing,
but it will take an extra HTTP transaction so it should be avoided.
.SS Modified time and Hashes
.PP
Dropbox supports modified times, but the only way to set a modification
time is to re\-upload the file.
.PP
This means that if you uploaded your data with an older version of
rclone which didn\[cq]t support the v2 API and modified times, rclone
will decide to upload all your old data to fix the modification times.
If you don\[cq]t want this to happen use \f[C]\-\-size\-only\f[R] or
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[R] flag to stop it.
.PP
Dropbox supports its own hash
type (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/content-hash) which
is checked for all transfers.

Note that chunks are buffered in memory (one at a time) so rclone can
deal with retries.
Setting this larger will increase the speed slightly (at most 10% for
128MB in tests) at the cost of using more memory.
It can be set smaller if you are tight on memory.

.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Dropbox is case insensitive so you can\[cq]t have a file
called \[lq]Hello.doc\[rq] and one called \[lq]hello.doc\[rq].
.PP
There are some file names such as \f[C]thumbs.db\f[R] which Dropbox
can\[cq]t store.
There is a full list of them in the \[lq]Ignored Files\[rq] section of
this document (https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/145).
Rclone will issue an error message
\f[C]File name disallowed \- not uploading\f[R] if it attempts to upload
one of those file names, but the sync won\[cq]t fail.
.PP
If you have more than 10,000 files in a directory then
\f[C]rclone purge dropbox:dir\f[R] will return the error
\f[C]Failed to purge: There are too many files involved in this operation\f[R].
As a work\-around do an \f[C]rclone delete dropbox:dir\f[R] followed by
an \f[C]rclone rmdir dropbox:dir\f[R].
.SS Get your own Dropbox App ID
.PP
When you use rclone with Dropbox in its default configuration you are
using rclone\[cq]s App ID.
This is shared between all the rclone users.
.PP
Here is how to create your own Dropbox App ID for rclone:
.IP "1." 3
Log into the Dropbox App
console (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create) with your
Dropbox Account (It need not to be the same account as the Dropbox you
want to access)
.IP "2." 3
Choose an API => Usually this should be \f[C]Dropbox API\f[R]
.IP "3." 3
Choose the type of access you want to use => \f[C]Full Dropbox\f[R] or
\f[C]App Folder\f[R]
.IP "4." 3
Name your App.
The app name is global, so you can\[cq]t use \f[C]rclone\f[R] for
example
.IP "5." 3
Click the button \f[C]Create App\f[R]
.IP "6." 3
Fill \f[C]Redirect URIs\f[R] as \f[C]http://localhost:53682/\f[R]
.IP "7." 3
Find the \f[C]App key\f[R] and \f[C]App secret\f[R] Use these values in
rclone config to add a new remote or edit an existing remote.
.SS FTP
.PP
FTP is the File Transfer Protocol.
FTP support is provided using the
github.com/jlaffaye/ftp (https://godoc.org/github.com/jlaffaye/ftp)

.SS Implicit TLS
.PP
FTP supports implicit FTP over TLS servers (FTPS).

To get credentials for Google Cloud Platform IAM Service
Accounts (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts), please
head to the Service
Account (https://console.cloud.google.com/permissions/serviceaccounts)
section of the Google Developer Console.
Service Accounts behave just like normal \f[C]User\f[R] permissions in
Google Cloud Storage
ACLs (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control), so you can
limit their access (e.g.\ make them read only).
After creating an account, a JSON file containing the Service
Account\[cq]s credentials will be downloaded onto your machines.
These credentials are what rclone will use for authentication.
.PP
To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path to
your Service Account credentials at the \f[C]service_account_file\f[R]
prompt and rclone won\[cq]t use the browser based authentication flow.
If you\[cq]d rather stuff the contents of the credentials file into the
rclone config file, you can set \f[C]service_account_credentials\f[R]
with the actual contents of the file instead, or set the equivalent
environment variable.
.SS Application Default Credentials
.PP
If no other source of credentials is provided, rclone will fall back to
Application Default
Credentials (https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/common/auth#authenticating_with_application_default_credentials)
this is useful both when you already have configured authentication for
your developer account, or in production when running on a google
compute host.
Note that if running in docker, you may need to run additional commands
on your google compute machine \- see this
page (https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#gcloud_as_a_docker_credential_helper).
.PP
Note that in the case application default credentials are used, there is
no need to explicitly configure a project number.
.SS \[en]fast\-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R] which allows you to use
fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.SS Custom upload headers
.PP
You can set custom upload headers with the \f[C]\-\-header\-upload\f[R]
flag.
Google Cloud Storage supports the headers as described in the working
with metadata
documentation (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/WorkingWithObjectMetadata)

.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]drive:path\f[R]
.PP
Drive paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]drive:directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.PP
The initial setup for drive involves getting a token from Google drive
which you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] walks you through it.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[R].
First run:
.IP

.fi
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall, or use
manual mode.
.PP
You can then use it like this,
.PP
List directories in top level of your drive
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd remote:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
List all the files in your drive
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone ls remote:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To copy a local directory to a drive directory called backup
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy /home/source remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Scopes
.PP
Rclone allows you to select which scope you would like for rclone to
use.
This changes what type of token is granted to rclone.
The scopes are defined
here (https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/about-auth).
.PP
The scope are
.SS drive
.PP
This is the default scope and allows full access to all files, except
for the Application Data Folder (see below).
.PP
Choose this one if you aren\[cq]t sure.
.SS drive.readonly
.PP
This allows read only access to all files.
Files may be listed and downloaded but not uploaded, renamed or deleted.
.SS drive.file
.PP
With this scope rclone can read/view/modify only those files and folders
it creates.
.PP
So if you uploaded files to drive via the web interface (or any other
means) they will not be visible to rclone.
.PP
This can be useful if you are using rclone to backup data and you want
to be sure confidential data on your drive is not visible to rclone.
.PP
Files created with this scope are visible in the web interface.
.SS drive.appfolder
.PP
This gives rclone its own private area to store files.
Rclone will not be able to see any other files on your drive and you
won\[cq]t be able to see rclone\[cq]s files from the web interface
either.
.SS drive.metadata.readonly
.PP
This allows read only access to file names only.
It does not allow rclone to download or upload data, or rename or delete
files or directories.
.SS Root folder ID
.PP
You can set the \f[C]root_folder_id\f[R] for rclone.
This is the directory (identified by its \f[C]Folder ID\f[R]) that
rclone considers to be the root of your drive.
.PP
Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct
root to use itself.
.PP
However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy or to access data within the \[lq]Computers\[rq] tab on the
drive web interface (where files from Google\[cq]s Backup and Sync
desktop program go).
.PP
In order to do this you will have to find the \f[C]Folder ID\f[R] of the
directory you wish rclone to display.
This will be the last segment of the URL when you open the relevant
folder in the drive web interface.
.PP
So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
\f[C]https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh\f[R]
in the browser, then you use \f[C]1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh\f[R]
as the \f[C]root_folder_id\f[R] in the config.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] folders under the \[lq]Computers\[rq] tab seem to be read
only (drive gives a 500 error) when using rclone.
.PP
There doesn\[cq]t appear to be an API to discover the folder IDs of the
\[lq]Computers\[rq] tab \- please contact us if you know otherwise!
.PP
Note also that rclone can\[cq]t access any data under the
\[lq]Backups\[rq] tab on the google drive web interface yet.
.SS Service Account support
.PP
You can set up rclone with Google Drive in an unattended mode, i.e.\ not
tied to a specific end\-user Google account.
This is useful when you want to synchronise files onto machines that
don\[cq]t have actively logged\-in users, for example build machines.
.PP
To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path to
your Service Account credentials at the \f[C]service_account_file\f[R]
prompt during \f[C]rclone config\f[R] and rclone won\[cq]t use the
browser based authentication flow.
If you\[cq]d rather stuff the contents of the credentials file into the
rclone config file, you can set \f[C]service_account_credentials\f[R]
with the actual contents of the file instead, or set the equivalent
environment variable.
.SS Use case \- Google Apps/G\-suite account and individual Drive
.PP
Let\[cq]s say that you are the administrator of a Google Apps (old) or
G\-suite account.
The goal is to store data on an individual\[cq]s Drive account, who IS a
member of the domain.
We\[cq]ll call the domain \f[B]example.com\f[R], and the user
\f[B]foo\[at]example.com\f[R].
.PP
There\[cq]s a few steps we need to go through to accomplish this:
.SS 1. Create a service account for example.com
.IP \[bu] 2
To create a service account and obtain its credentials, go to the Google
Developer Console (https://console.developers.google.com).
.IP \[bu] 2
You must have a project \- create one if you don\[cq]t.
.IP \[bu] 2
Then go to \[lq]IAM & admin\[rq] \-> \[lq]Service Accounts\[rq].
.IP \[bu] 2
Use the \[lq]Create Credentials\[rq] button.
Fill in \[lq]Service account name\[rq] with something that identifies
your client.
\[lq]Role\[rq] can be empty.
.IP \[bu] 2
Tick \[lq]Furnish a new private key\[rq] \- select \[lq]Key type
JSON\[rq].
.IP \[bu] 2
Tick \[lq]Enable G Suite Domain\-wide Delegation\[rq].
This option makes \[lq]impersonation\[rq] possible, as documented here:
Delegating domain\-wide authority to the service
account (https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#delegatingauthority)
.IP \[bu] 2
These credentials are what rclone will use for authentication.
If you ever need to remove access, press the \[lq]Delete service account
key\[rq] button.
.SS 2. Allowing API access to example.com Google Drive
.IP \[bu] 2
Go to example.com\[cq]s admin console
.IP \[bu] 2
Go into \[lq]Security\[rq] (or use the search bar)
.IP \[bu] 2
Select \[lq]Show more\[rq] and then \[lq]Advanced settings\[rq]
.IP \[bu] 2
Select \[lq]Manage API client access\[rq] in the
\[lq]Authentication\[rq] section
.IP \[bu] 2
In the \[lq]Client Name\[rq] field enter the service account\[cq]s
\[lq]Client ID\[rq] \- this can be found in the Developer Console under
\[lq]IAM & Admin\[rq] \-> \[lq]Service Accounts\[rq], then \[lq]View
Client ID\[rq] for the newly created service account.
It is a \[ti]21 character numerical string.
.IP \[bu] 2
In the next field, \[lq]One or More API Scopes\[rq], enter
\f[C]https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive\f[R] to grant access to
Google Drive specifically.
.SS 3. Configure rclone, assuming a new install
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone config

n/s/q> n         # New
name>gdrive      # Gdrive is an example name

service_account_file> /home/foo/myJSONfile.json # This is where the JSON file goes!
y/n>             # Auto config, y
\f[R]
.fi
.SS 4. Verify that it\[cq]s working
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]rclone \-v \-\-drive\-impersonate foo\[at]example.com lsf gdrive:backup\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
The arguments do:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-v\f[R] \- verbose logging
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-drive\-impersonate foo\[at]example.com\f[R] \- this is what
does the magic, pretending to be user foo.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]lsf\f[R] \- list files in a parsing friendly way
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]gdrive:backup\f[R] \- use the remote called gdrive, work in the
folder named backup.

.SS \[en]fast\-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R] which allows you to use
fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.PP
It does this by combining multiple \f[C]list\f[R] calls into a single
API request.
.PP
This works by combining many \f[C]\[aq]%s\[aq] in parents\f[R] filters
into one expression.
To list the contents of directories a, b and c, the following requests
will be send by the regular \f[C]List\f[R] function:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
trashed=false and \[aq]a\[aq] in parents
trashed=false and \[aq]b\[aq] in parents
trashed=false and \[aq]c\[aq] in parents
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
These can now be combined into a single request:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
trashed=false and (\[aq]a\[aq] in parents or \[aq]b\[aq] in parents or \[aq]c\[aq] in parents)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The implementation of \f[C]ListR\f[R] will put up to 50
\f[C]parents\f[R] filters into one request.
It will use the \f[C]\-\-checkers\f[R] value to specify the number of
requests to run in parallel.
.PP
In tests, these batch requests were up to 20x faster than the regular
method.
Running the following command against different sized folders gives:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsjson \-vv \-R \-\-checkers=6 gdrive:folder
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
small folder (220 directories, 700 files):
.IP \[bu] 2
without \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R]: 38s
.IP \[bu] 2
with \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R]: 10s
.PP
large folder (10600 directories, 39000 files):
.IP \[bu] 2
without \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R]: 22:05 min
.IP \[bu] 2
with \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R]: 58s
.SS Modified time
.PP
Google drive stores modification times accurate to 1 ms.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
Only Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[cq]t
be used in JSON strings.
.PP
In contrast to other backends, \f[C]/\f[R] can also be used in names and
\f[C].\f[R] or \f[C]..\f[R] are valid names.
.SS Revisions
.PP
Google drive stores revisions of files.
When you upload a change to an existing file to google drive using
rclone it will create a new revision of that file.
.PP
Revisions follow the standard google policy which at time of writing was
.IP \[bu] 2
They are deleted after 30 days or 100 revisions (whatever comes first).
.IP \[bu] 2
They do not count towards a user storage quota.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
By default rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files.
If deleting them permanently is required then use the
\f[C]\-\-drive\-use\-trash=false\f[R] flag, or set the equivalent
environment variable.
.SS Shortcuts
.PP
In March 2020 Google introduced a new feature in Google Drive called
drive shortcuts (https://support.google.com/drive/answer/9700156)
(API (https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/shortcuts)).
These will (by September 2020) replace the ability for files or folders
to be in multiple folders at
once (https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/simplifying-google-drives-folder-structure-and-sharing-models).
.PP
Shortcuts are files that link to other files on Google Drive somewhat
like a symlink in unix, except they point to the underlying file data
(eg the inode in unix terms) so they don\[cq]t break if the source is
renamed or moved about.
.PP
Be default rclone treats these as follows.
.PP
For shortcuts pointing to files:
.IP \[bu] 2
When listing a file shortcut appears as the destination file.
.IP \[bu] 2
When downloading the contents of the destination file is downloaded.
.IP \[bu] 2
When updating shortcut file with a non shortcut file, the shortcut is
removed then a new file is uploaded in place of the shortcut.
.IP \[bu] 2
When server side moving (renaming) the shortcut is renamed, not the
destination file.
.IP \[bu] 2
When server side copying the shortcut is copied, not the contents of the
shortcut.
.IP \[bu] 2
When deleting the shortcut is deleted not the linked file.
.IP \[bu] 2
When setting the modification time, the modification time of the linked
file will be set.
.PP
For shortcuts pointing to folders:
.IP \[bu] 2
When listing the shortcut appears as a folder and that folder will
contain the contents of the linked folder appear (including any sub
folders)
.IP \[bu] 2
When downloading the contents of the linked folder and sub contents are
downloaded
.IP \[bu] 2
When uploading to a shortcut folder the file will be placed in the
linked folder
.IP \[bu] 2
When server side moving (renaming) the shortcut is renamed, not the
destination folder
.IP \[bu] 2
When server side copying the contents of the linked folder is copied,
not the shortcut.
.IP \[bu] 2
When deleting with \f[C]rclone rmdir\f[R] or \f[C]rclone purge\f[R] the
shortcut is deleted not the linked folder.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]NB\f[R] When deleting with \f[C]rclone remove\f[R] or
\f[C]rclone mount\f[R] the contents of the linked folder will be
deleted.
.PP
The rclone backend (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command
can be used to create shortcuts.
.PP
Shortcuts can be completely ignored with the
\f[C]\-\-drive\-skip\-shortcuts\f[R] flag or the corresponding
\f[C]skip_shortcuts\f[R] configuration setting.
.SS Emptying trash
.PP
If you wish to empty your trash you can use the
\f[C]rclone cleanup remote:\f[R] command which will permanently delete
all your trashed files.
This command does not take any path arguments.
.PP
Note that Google Drive takes some time (minutes to days) to empty the
trash even though the command returns within a few seconds.
No output is echoed, so there will be no confirmation even using \-v or
\-vv.
.SS Quota information
.PP
To view your current quota you can use the
\f[C]rclone about remote:\f[R] command which will display your usage
limit (quota), the usage in Google Drive, the size of all files in the
Trash and the space used by other Google services such as Gmail.
This command does not take any path arguments.
.SS Import/Export of google documents
.PP
Google documents can be exported from and uploaded to Google Drive.
.PP
When rclone downloads a Google doc it chooses a format to download
depending upon the \f[C]\-\-drive\-export\-formats\f[R] setting.
By default the export formats are \f[C]docx,xlsx,pptx,svg\f[R] which are
a sensible default for an editable document.
.PP
When choosing a format, rclone runs down the list provided in order and
chooses the first file format the doc can be exported as from the list.
If the file can\[cq]t be exported to a format on the formats list, then
rclone will choose a format from the default list.
.PP
If you prefer an archive copy then you might use
\f[C]\-\-drive\-export\-formats pdf\f[R], or if you prefer
openoffice/libreoffice formats you might use
\f[C]\-\-drive\-export\-formats ods,odt,odp\f[R].
.PP
Note that rclone adds the extension to the google doc, so if it is
called \f[C]My Spreadsheet\f[R] on google docs, it will be exported as
\f[C]My Spreadsheet.xlsx\f[R] or \f[C]My Spreadsheet.pdf\f[R] etc.
.PP
When importing files into Google Drive, rclone will convert all files
with an extension in \f[C]\-\-drive\-import\-formats\f[R] to their
associated document type.
rclone will not convert any files by default, since the conversion is
lossy process.
.PP
The conversion must result in a file with the same extension when the
\f[C]\-\-drive\-export\-formats\f[R] rules are applied to the uploaded
document.
.PP
Here are some examples for allowed and prohibited conversions.

.PP
This limitation can be disabled by specifying
\f[C]\-\-drive\-allow\-import\-name\-change\f[R].
When using this flag, rclone can convert multiple files types resulting
in the same document type at once, eg with
\f[C]\-\-drive\-import\-formats docx,odt,txt\f[R], all files having
these extension would result in a document represented as a docx file.
This brings the additional risk of overwriting a document, if multiple
files have the same stem.
Many rclone operations will not handle this name change in any way.
They assume an equal name when copying files and might copy the file
again or delete them when the name changes.
.PP
Here are the possible export extensions with their corresponding mime
types.
Most of these can also be used for importing, but there more that are
not listed here.
Some of these additional ones might only be available when the operating
system provides the correct MIME type entries.
.PP
This list can be changed by Google Drive at any time and might not
represent the currently available conversions.

.SS Backend commands
.PP
Here are the commands specific to the drive backend.
.PP
Run them with
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend COMMAND remote:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.
.PP
See the \[lq]rclone backend\[rq]
command (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) for more info on
how to pass options and arguments.
.PP
These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
backend/command (https://rclone.org/rc/#backend/command).
.SS get
.PP
Get command for fetching the drive config parameters
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend get remote: [options] [<arguments>+]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This is a get command which will be used to fetch the various drive
config parameters
.PP
Usage Examples:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend get drive: [\-o service_account_file] [\-o chunk_size]
rclone rc backend/command command=get fs=drive: [\-o service_account_file] [\-o chunk_size]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Options:
.IP \[bu] 2
\[lq]chunk_size\[rq]: show the current upload chunk size
.IP \[bu] 2
\[lq]service_account_file\[rq]: show the current service account file
.SS set
.PP
Set command for updating the drive config parameters
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend set remote: [options] [<arguments>+]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This is a set command which will be used to update the various drive
config parameters
.PP
Usage Examples:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend set drive: [\-o service_account_file=sa.json] [\-o chunk_size=67108864]
rclone rc backend/command command=set fs=drive: [\-o service_account_file=sa.json] [\-o chunk_size=67108864]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Options:
.IP \[bu] 2
\[lq]chunk_size\[rq]: update the current upload chunk size
.IP \[bu] 2
\[lq]service_account_file\[rq]: update the current service account file
.SS shortcut
.PP
Create shortcuts from files or directories
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend shortcut remote: [options] [<arguments>+]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This command creates shortcuts from files or directories.
.PP
Usage:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend shortcut drive: source_item destination_shortcut
rclone backend shortcut drive: source_item \-o target=drive2: destination_shortcut
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In the first example this creates a shortcut from the
\[lq]source_item\[rq] which can be a file or a directory to the
\[lq]destination_shortcut\[rq].
The \[lq]source_item\[rq] and the \[lq]destination_shortcut\[rq] should
be relative paths from \[lq]drive:\[rq]
.PP
In the second example this creates a shortcut from the
\[lq]source_item\[rq] relative to \[lq]drive:\[rq] to the
\[lq]destination_shortcut\[rq] relative to \[lq]drive2:\[rq].
This may fail with a permission error if the user authenticated with
\[lq]drive2:\[rq] can\[cq]t read files from \[lq]drive:\[rq].
.PP
Options:
.IP \[bu] 2
\[lq]target\[rq]: optional target remote for the shortcut destination
.SS Limitations
.PP
Drive has quite a lot of rate limiting.
This causes rclone to be limited to transferring about 2 files per
second only.
Individual files may be transferred much faster at 100s of MBytes/s but
lots of small files can take a long time.
.PP
Server side copies are also subject to a separate rate limit.
If you see User rate limit exceeded errors, wait at least 24 hours and
retry.
You can disable server side copies with \f[C]\-\-disable copy\f[R] to
download and upload the files if you prefer.
.SS Limitations of Google Docs
.PP
Google docs will appear as size \-1 in \f[C]rclone ls\f[R] and as size 0
in anything which uses the VFS layer, eg \f[C]rclone mount\f[R],
\f[C]rclone serve\f[R].
.PP
This is because rclone can\[cq]t find out the size of the Google docs
without downloading them.
.PP
Google docs will transfer correctly with \f[C]rclone sync\f[R],
\f[C]rclone copy\f[R] etc as rclone knows to ignore the size when doing
the transfer.
.PP
However an unfortunate consequence of this is that you may not be able
to download Google docs using \f[C]rclone mount\f[R].
If it doesn\[cq]t work you will get a 0 sized file.
If you try again the doc may gain its correct size and be downloadable.
Whether it will work on not depends on the application accessing the
mount and the OS you are running \- experiment to find out if it does
work for you!
.SS Duplicated files
.PP
Sometimes, for no reason I\[cq]ve been able to track down, drive will
duplicate a file that rclone uploads.
Drive unlike all the other remotes can have duplicated files.
.PP
Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.
.PP
Use \f[C]rclone dedupe\f[R] to fix duplicated files.
.PP
Note that this isn\[cq]t just a problem with rclone, even Google Photos
on Android duplicates files on drive sometimes.
.SS Rclone appears to be re\-copying files it shouldn\[cq]t
.PP
The most likely cause of this is the duplicated file issue above \- run
\f[C]rclone dedupe\f[R] and check your logs for duplicate object or
directory messages.
.PP
This can also be caused by a delay/caching on google drive\[cq]s end
when comparing directory listings.
Specifically with team drives used in combination with \[en]fast\-list.
Files that were uploaded recently may not appear on the directory list
sent to rclone when using \[en]fast\-list.
.PP
Waiting a moderate period of time between attempts (estimated to be
approximately 1 hour) and/or not using \[en]fast\-list both seem to be
effective in preventing the problem.
.SS Making your own client_id
.PP
When you use rclone with Google drive in its default configuration you
are using rclone\[cq]s client_id.
This is shared between all the rclone users.
There is a global rate limit on the number of queries per second that
each client_id can do set by Google.
rclone already has a high quota and I will continue to make sure it is
high enough by contacting Google.
.PP
It is strongly recommended to use your own client ID as the default
rclone ID is heavily used.
If you have multiple services running, it is recommended to use an API
key for each service.
The default Google quota is 10 transactions per second so it is
recommended to stay under that number as if you use more than that, it
will cause rclone to rate limit and make things slower.
.PP
Here is how to create your own Google Drive client ID for rclone:
.IP "1." 3
Log into the Google API Console (https://console.developers.google.com/)
with your Google account.
It doesn\[cq]t matter what Google account you use.
(It need not be the same account as the Google Drive you want to access)
.IP "2." 3
Select a project or create a new project.
.IP "3." 3
Under \[lq]ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES\[rq] search for \[lq]Drive\[rq], and
enable the \[lq]Google Drive API\[rq].
.IP "4." 3
Click \[lq]Credentials\[rq] in the left\-side panel (not \[lq]Create
credentials\[rq], which opens the wizard), then \[lq]Create
credentials\[rq]
.IP "5." 3
If you already configured an \[lq]Oauth Consent Screen\[rq], then skip
to the next step; if not, click on \[lq]CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN\[rq]
button (near the top right corner of the right panel), then select
\[lq]External\[rq] and click on \[lq]CREATE\[rq]; on the next screen,
enter an \[lq]Application name\[rq] (\[lq]rclone\[rq] is OK) then click
on \[lq]Save\[rq] (all other data is optional).
Click again on \[lq]Credentials\[rq] on the left panel to go back to the
\[lq]Credentials\[rq] screen.
.PP
(PS: if you are a GSuite user, you could also select \[lq]Internal\[rq]
instead of \[lq]External\[rq] above, but this has not been
tested/documented so far).
.IP "6." 3
Click on the \[lq]+ CREATE CREDENTIALS\[rq] button at the top of the
screen, then select \[lq]OAuth client ID\[rq].
.IP "7." 3
Choose an application type of \[lq]Desktop app\[rq] if you using a
Google account or \[lq]Other\[rq] if you using a GSuite account and
click \[lq]Create\[rq].
(the default name is fine)
.IP "8." 3
It will show you a client ID and client secret.
Use these values in rclone config to add a new remote or edit an
existing remote.
.PP
Be aware that, due to the \[lq]enhanced security\[rq] recently
introduced by Google, you are theoretically expected to \[lq]submit your
app for verification\[rq] and then wait a few weeks(!) for their
response; in practice, you can go right ahead and use the client ID and
client secret with rclone, the only issue will be a very scary
confirmation screen shown when you connect via your browser for rclone
to be able to get its token\-id (but as this only happens during the
remote configuration, it\[cq]s not such a big deal).
.PP
(Thanks to \[at]balazer on github for these instructions.)
.SS Google Photos
.PP
The rclone backend for Google
Photos (https://www.google.com/photos/about/) is a specialized backend
for transferring photos and videos to and from Google Photos.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] The Google Photos API which rclone uses has quite a few
limitations, so please read the limitations section carefully to make
sure it is suitable for your use.
.SS Configuring Google Photos
.PP
The initial setup for google cloud storage involves getting a token from
Google Photos which you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] walks you through it.

.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this may require you to
unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall, or use manual
mode.
.PP
This remote is called \f[C]remote\f[R] and can now be used like this
.PP

.SS Layout
.PP
As Google Photos is not a general purpose cloud storage system the
backend is laid out to help you navigate it.
.PP
The directories under \f[C]media\f[R] show different ways of
categorizing the media.
Each file will appear multiple times.
So if you want to make a backup of your google photos you might choose
to backup \f[C]remote:media/by\-month\f[R].
(\f[B]NB\f[R] \f[C]remote:media/by\-day\f[R] is rather slow at the
moment so avoid for syncing.)
.PP
Note that all your photos and videos will appear somewhere under
\f[C]media\f[R], but they may not appear under \f[C]album\f[R] unless
you\[cq]ve put them into albums.

.fi
.PP
There are two writable parts of the tree, the \f[C]upload\f[R] directory
and sub directories of the \f[C]album\f[R] directory.
.PP
The \f[C]upload\f[R] directory is for uploading files you don\[cq]t want
to put into albums.
This will be empty to start with and will contain the files you\[cq]ve
uploaded for one rclone session only, becoming empty again when you
restart rclone.
The use case for this would be if you have a load of files you just want
to once off dump into Google Photos.
For repeated syncing, uploading to \f[C]album\f[R] will work better.
.PP
Directories within the \f[C]album\f[R] directory are also writeable and
you may create new directories (albums) under \f[C]album\f[R].
If you copy files with a directory hierarchy in there then rclone will
create albums with the \f[C]/\f[R] character in them.
For example if you do
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy /path/to/images remote:album/images
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
and the images directory contains
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
images
    \- file1.jpg
    dir
        file2.jpg
    dir2
        dir3
            file3.jpg
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then rclone will create the following albums with the following files in
.IP \[bu] 2
images
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
file1.jpg
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
images/dir
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
file2.jpg
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
images/dir2/dir3
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
file3.jpg
.RE
.PP
This means that you can use the \f[C]album\f[R] path pretty much like a
normal filesystem and it is a good target for repeated syncing.
.PP
The \f[C]shared\-album\f[R] directory shows albums shared with you or by
you.
This is similar to the Sharing tab in the Google Photos web interface.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Only images and videos can be uploaded.
If you attempt to upload non videos or images or formats that Google
Photos doesn\[cq]t understand, rclone will upload the file, then Google
Photos will give an error when it is put turned into a media item.
.PP
Note that all media items uploaded to Google Photos through the API are
stored in full resolution at \[lq]original quality\[rq] and
\f[B]will\f[R] count towards your storage quota in your Google Account.
The API does \f[B]not\f[R] offer a way to upload in \[lq]high
quality\[rq] mode..
.SS Downloading Images
.PP
When Images are downloaded this strips EXIF location (according to the
docs and my tests).
This is a limitation of the Google Photos API and is covered by bug
#112096115 (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/112096115).
.PP
\f[B]The current google API does not allow photos to be downloaded at
original resolution. This is very important if you are, for example,
relying on \[lq]Google Photos\[rq] as a backup of your photos. You will
not be able to use rclone to redownload original images. You could use
`google takeout' to recover the original photos as a last resort\f[R]
.SS Downloading Videos
.PP
When videos are downloaded they are downloaded in a really compressed
version of the video compared to downloading it via the Google Photos
web interface.
This is covered by bug
#113672044 (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/113672044).
.SS Duplicates

If a file name is duplicated in a directory then rclone will add the
file ID into its name.
So two files called \f[C]file.jpg\f[R] would then appear as
\f[C]file {123456}.jpg\f[R] and \f[C]file {ABCDEF}.jpg\f[R] (the actual
IDs are a lot longer alas!).
.PP
If you upload the same image (with the same binary data) twice then
Google Photos will deduplicate it.
However it will retain the filename from the first upload which may
confuse rclone.
For example if you uploaded an image to \f[C]upload\f[R] then uploaded
the same image to \f[C]album/my_album\f[R] the filename of the image in
\f[C]album/my_album\f[R] will be what it was uploaded with initially,
not what you uploaded it with to \f[C]album\f[R].
In practise this shouldn\[cq]t cause too many problems.
.SS Modified time
.PP
The date shown of media in Google Photos is the creation date as
determined by the EXIF information, or the upload date if that is not
known.
.PP
This is not changeable by rclone and is not the modification date of the
media on local disk.
This means that rclone cannot use the dates from Google Photos for
syncing purposes.
.SS Size
.PP
The Google Photos API does not return the size of media.
This means that when syncing to Google Photos, rclone can only do a file
existence check.
.PP
It is possible to read the size of the media, but this needs an extra
HTTP HEAD request per media item so is \f[B]very slow\f[R] and uses up a
lot of transactions.
This can be enabled with the \f[C]\-\-gphotos\-read\-size\f[R] option or
the \f[C]read_size = true\f[R] config parameter.
.PP
If you want to use the backend with \f[C]rclone mount\f[R] you may need
to enable this flag (depending on your OS and application using the
photos) otherwise you may not be able to read media off the mount.
You\[cq]ll need to experiment to see if it works for you without the
flag.
.SS Albums
.PP
Rclone can only upload files to albums it created.
This is a limitation of the Google Photos
API (https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/manage-albums).
.PP
Rclone can remove files it uploaded from albums it created only.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Rclone can remove files from albums it created, but note that the Google
Photos API does not allow media to be deleted permanently so this media
will still remain.
See bug #109759781 (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/109759781).
.PP
Rclone cannot delete files anywhere except under \f[C]album\f[R].
.SS Deleting albums
.PP
The Google Photos API does not support deleting albums \- see bug
#135714733 (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/135714733).

.SS \[en]gphotos\-read\-size
.PP
Set to read the size of media items.
.PP
Normally rclone does not read the size of media items since this takes
another transaction.
This isn\[cq]t necessary for syncing.
However rclone mount needs to know the size of files in advance of
reading them, so setting this flag when using rclone mount is
recommended if you want to read the media.

.SS HTTP
.PP
The HTTP remote is a read only remote for reading files of a webserver.
The webserver should provide file listings which rclone will read and
turn into a remote.
This has been tested with common webservers such as Apache/Nginx/Caddy
and will likely work with file listings from most web servers.
(If it doesn\[cq]t then please file an issue, or send a pull request!)
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:\f[R] or
\f[C]remote:path/to/dir\f[R].

.SS Modified time
.PP
Most HTTP servers store time accurate to 1 second.
.SS Checksum
.PP
No checksums are stored.
.SS Usage without a config file

Set this if the site doesn\[cq]t end directories with /
.PP
Use this if your target website does not use / on the end of
directories.
.PP
A / on the end of a path is how rclone normally tells the difference
between files and directories.
If this flag is set, then rclone will treat all files with
Content\-Type: text/html as directories and read URLs from them rather
than downloading them.
.PP
Note that this may cause rclone to confuse genuine HTML files with
directories.

.SS \[en]http\-no\-head
.PP
Don\[cq]t use HEAD requests to find file sizes in dir listing
.PP
If your site is being very slow to load then you can try this option.
Normally rclone does a HEAD request for each potential file in a
directory listing to:
.IP \[bu] 2
find its size
.IP \[bu] 2
check it really exists
.IP \[bu] 2
check to see if it is a directory
.PP
If you set this option, rclone will not do the HEAD request.
This will mean
.IP \[bu] 2
directory listings are much quicker

See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Hubic.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[R] like this,

fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X\-Object\-Meta\-Mtime\f[R] as floating point since the epoch
accurate to 1 ns.
.PP
This is a de facto standard (used in the official python\-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.

Don\[cq]t chunk files during streaming upload.
.PP
When doing streaming uploads (eg using rcat or mount) setting this flag
will cause the swift backend to not upload chunked files.
.PP
This will limit the maximum upload size to 5GB.
However non chunked files are easier to deal with and have an MD5SUM.

This uses the normal OpenStack Swift mechanism to refresh the Swift API
credentials and ignores the expires field returned by the Hubic API.
.PP
The Swift API doesn\[cq]t return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won\[cq]t check or use the
MD5SUM for these.
.SS Jottacloud
.PP
Jottacloud is a cloud storage service provider from a Norwegian company,
using its own datacenters in Norway.
.PP
In addition to the official service at
jottacloud.com (https://www.jottacloud.com/), there are also several
whitelabel versions which should work with this backend.
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[R]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.SS Setup
.PP
To configure Jottacloud you will need to generate a personal security
token in the Jottacloud web interface.
You will the option to do in your account security
settings (https://www.jottacloud.com/web/secure) (for whitelabel version
you need to find this page in its web interface).
Note that the web interface may refer to this token as a JottaCli token.

\f[R]
.fi
.SS Devices and Mountpoints
.PP
The official Jottacloud client registers a device for each computer you
install it on, and then creates a mountpoint for each folder you select
for Backup.
The web interface uses a special device called Jotta for the Archive and
Sync mountpoints.
In most cases you\[cq]ll want to use the Jotta/Archive
device/mountpoint, however if you want to access files uploaded by any
of the official clients rclone provides the option to select other
devices and mountpoints during config.
.PP
The built\-in Jotta device may also contain several other mountpoints,
such as: Latest, Links, Shared and Trash.
These are special mountpoints with a different internal representation
than the \[lq]regular\[rq] mountpoints.
Rclone will only to a very limited degree support them.
Generally you should avoid these, unless you know what you are doing.
.SS \[en]fast\-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R] which allows you to use
fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.PP
Note that the implementation in Jottacloud always uses only a single API
request to get the entire list, so for large folders this could lead to
long wait time before the first results are shown.
.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
Jottacloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
.PP
Jottacloud supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[R] flag.
.PP
Note that Jottacloud requires the MD5 hash before upload so if the
source does not have an MD5 checksum then the file will be cached
temporarily on disk (wherever the \f[C]TMPDIR\f[R] environment variable
points to) before it is uploaded.
Small files will be cached in memory \- see the
\[en]jottacloud\-md5\-memory\-limit flag.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
In addition to the default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters) the following
characters are also replaced:

.PP
Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[cq]t
be used in XML strings.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
By default rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files.
They will be permanently deleted automatically after 30 days.
You may bypass the trash and permanently delete files immediately by
using the \[en]jottacloud\-hard\-delete flag, or set the equivalent
environment variable.
Emptying the trash is supported by the
cleanup (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_cleanup/) command.
.SS Versions
.PP
Jottacloud supports file versioning.
When rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a new version of
it.
Currently rclone only supports retrieving the current version but older
versions can be accessed via the Jottacloud Website.
.SS Quota information
.PP
To view your current quota you can use the
\f[C]rclone about remote:\f[R] command which will display your usage
limit (unless it is unlimited) and the current usage.
.SS Advanced Options
.PP
Here are the advanced options specific to jottacloud (Jottacloud).

.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Jottacloud is case insensitive so you can\[cq]t have a file
called \[lq]Hello.doc\[rq] and one called \[lq]hello.doc\[rq].
.PP
There are quite a few characters that can\[cq]t be in Jottacloud file
names.
Rclone will map these names to and from an identical looking unicode
equivalent.
For example if a file has a ?
in it will be mapped to \[uFF1F] instead.
.PP
Jottacloud only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.
.SS Troubleshooting
.PP
Jottacloud exhibits some inconsistent behaviours regarding deleted files
and folders which may cause Copy, Move and DirMove operations to
previously deleted paths to fail.
Emptying the trash should help in such cases.
.SS Koofr
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[R]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.PP
The initial setup for Koofr involves creating an application password
for rclone.
You can do that by opening the Koofr web
application (https://app.koofr.net/app/admin/preferences/password),
giving the password a nice name like \f[C]rclone\f[R] and clicking on
generate.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]koofr\f[R].
First run:

.SS Mail.ru Cloud
.PP
Mail.ru Cloud (https://cloud.mail.ru/) is a cloud storage provided by a
Russian internet company Mail.Ru Group (https://mail.ru).
The official desktop client is Disk\-O: (https://disk-o.cloud/),
available only on Windows.
(Please note that official sites are in Russian)
.PP
Currently it is recommended to disable 2FA on Mail.ru accounts intended
for rclone until it gets eventually implemented.
.SS Features highlights
.IP \[bu] 2
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2

don\[cq]t
.IP \[bu] 2
Deleted files are by default moved to the trash
.IP \[bu] 2
Files and directories can be shared via public links
.IP \[bu] 2
Partial uploads or streaming are not supported, file size must be known
before upload
.IP \[bu] 2
Maximum file size is limited to 2G for a free account, unlimited for
paid accounts
.IP \[bu] 2
Storage keeps hash for all files and performs transparent deduplication,
the hash algorithm is a modified SHA1
.IP \[bu] 2
If a particular file is already present in storage, one can quickly
submit file hash instead of long file upload (this optimization is
supported by rclone)
.SS Configuration
.PP
Here is an example of making a mailru configuration.
First create a Mail.ru Cloud account and choose a tariff, then run
.IP

excess files in the path.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:directory

.fi
.SS Modified time
.PP
Files support a modification time attribute with up to 1 second
precision.
Directories do not have a modification time, which is shown as \[lq]Jan
1 1970\[rq].
.SS Hash checksums
.PP
Hash sums use a custom Mail.ru algorithm based on SHA1.
If file size is less than or equal to the SHA1 block size (20 bytes),
its hash is simply its data right\-padded with zero bytes.
Hash sum of a larger file is computed as a SHA1 sum of the file data
bytes concatenated with a decimal representation of the data length.
.SS Emptying Trash
.PP
Removing a file or directory actually moves it to the trash, which is
not visible to rclone but can be seen in a web browser.
The trashed file still occupies part of total quota.
If you wish to empty your trash and free some quota, you can use the
\f[C]rclone cleanup remote:\f[R] command, which will permanently delete
all your trashed files.
This command does not take any path arguments.
.SS Quota information
.PP
To view your current quota you can use the
\f[C]rclone about remote:\f[R] command which will display your usage
limit (quota) and the current usage.
.SS Restricted filename characters

.SS Mega
.PP
Mega (https://mega.nz/) is a cloud storage and file hosting service
known for its security feature where all files are encrypted locally
before they are uploaded.
This prevents anyone (including employees of Mega) from accessing the
files without knowledge of the key used for encryption.
.PP
This is an rclone backend for Mega which supports the file transfer
features of Mega using the same client side encryption.
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[R]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[R].
First run:

.SS Duplicated files
.PP
Mega can have two files with exactly the same name and path (unlike a
normal file system).
.PP
Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.
.PP
Use \f[C]rclone dedupe\f[R] to fix duplicated files.
.SS Failure to log\-in
.PP
Mega remotes seem to get blocked (reject logins) under \[lq]heavy

We haven\[cq]t worked out the exact blocking rules but it seems to be
related to fast paced, successive rclone commands.
.PP
For example, executing this command 90 times in a row
\f[C]rclone link remote:file\f[R] will cause the remote to become
\[lq]blocked\[rq].
This is not an abnormal situation, for example if you wish to get the
public links of a directory with hundred of files\&... After more or
less a week, the remote will remote accept rclone logins normally again.
.PP
You can mitigate this issue by mounting the remote it with
\f[C]rclone mount\f[R].
This will log\-in when mounting and a log\-out when unmounting only.
You can also run \f[C]rclone rcd\f[R] and then use \f[C]rclone rc\f[R]
to run the commands over the API to avoid logging in each time.
.PP
Rclone does not currently close mega sessions (you can see them in the
web interface), however closing the sessions does not solve the issue.
.PP
If you space rclone commands by 3 seconds it will avoid blocking the
remote.
We haven\[cq]t identified the exact blocking rules, so perhaps one could
execute the command 80 times without waiting and avoid blocking by
waiting 3 seconds, then continuing\&...
.PP
Note that this has been observed by trial and error and might not be set
in stone.
.PP
Other tools seem not to produce this blocking effect, as they use a
different working approach (state\-based, using sessionIDs instead of
log\-in) which isn\[cq]t compatible with the current stateless rclone
approach.
.PP
Note that once blocked, the use of other tools (such as megacmd) is not
a sure workaround: following megacmd login times have been observed in
succession for blocked remote: 7 minutes, 20 min, 30min, 30 min, 30min.
Web access looks unaffected though.
.PP
Investigation is continuing in relation to workarounds based on
timeouts, pacers, retrials and tpslimits \- if you discover something
relevant, please post on the forum.
.PP
So, if rclone was working nicely and suddenly you are unable to log\-in
and you are sure the user and the password are correct, likely you have
got the remote blocked for a while.
.SS Standard Options

.SS \[en]mega\-hard\-delete
.PP
Delete files permanently rather than putting them into the trash.
.PP
Normally the mega backend will put all deletions into the trash rather
than permanently deleting them.
If you specify this then rclone will permanently delete objects instead.
.IP \[bu] 2
Config: hard_delete
.IP \[bu] 2
Env Var: RCLONE_MEGA_HARD_DELETE
.IP \[bu] 2
Type: bool
.IP \[bu] 2

.IP \[bu] 2
Config: encoding
.IP \[bu] 2
Env Var: RCLONE_MEGA_ENCODING
.IP \[bu] 2
Type: MultiEncoder
.IP \[bu] 2
Default: Slash,InvalidUtf8,Dot
.SS Limitations
.PP
This backend uses the go\-mega go
library (https://github.com/t3rm1n4l/go-mega) which is an opensource go
library implementing the Mega API.
There doesn\[cq]t appear to be any documentation for the mega protocol
beyond the mega C++ SDK (https://github.com/meganz/sdk) source code so
there are likely quite a few errors still remaining in this library.
.PP
Mega allows duplicate files which may confuse rclone.
.SS Memory
.PP
The memory backend is an in RAM backend.
It does not persist its data \- use the local backend for that.
.PP
The memory backend behaves like a bucket based remote (eg like s3).
Because it has no parameters you can just use it with the
\f[C]:memory:\f[R] remote name.
.PP
You can configure it as a remote like this with \f[C]rclone config\f[R]
too if you want to:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
No remotes found \- make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\[dq]\[dq]).
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]

** See help for memory backend at: https://rclone.org/memory/ **

Remote config

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Because the memory backend isn\[cq]t persistent it is most useful for
testing or with an rclone server or rclone mount, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone mount :memory: /mnt/tmp
rclone serve webdav :memory:
rclone serve sftp :memory:
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
The memory backend supports MD5 hashes and modification times accurate
to 1 nS.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
The memory backend replaces the default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters).
.SS Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:container\f[R] (or \f[C]remote:\f[R]
for the \f[C]lsd\f[R] command.) You may put subdirectories in too, eg
\f[C]remote:container/path/to/dir\f[R].
.PP
Here is an example of making a Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
configuration.
For a remote called \f[C]remote\f[R].
First run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
 rclone config

any excess files in the container.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:container
\f[R]
.fi
.SS \[en]fast\-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R] which allows you to use
fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object with the
\f[C]mtime\f[R] key.
It is stored using RFC3339 Format time with nanosecond precision.
The metadata is supplied during directory listings so there is no
overhead to using it.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
In addition to the default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters) the following
characters are also replaced:
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
l c c.

.TE
.PP
Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[cq]t
be used in JSON strings.
.SS Hashes
.PP
MD5 hashes are stored with blobs.
However blobs that were uploaded in chunks only have an MD5 if the
source remote was capable of MD5 hashes, eg the local disk.
.SS Authenticating with Azure Blob Storage
.PP
Rclone has 3 ways of authenticating with Azure Blob Storage:
.SS Account and Key
.PP
This is the most straight forward and least flexible way.
Just fill in the \f[C]account\f[R] and \f[C]key\f[R] lines and leave the
rest blank.
.SS SAS URL
.PP
This can be an account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL.
.PP
To use it leave \f[C]account\f[R], \f[C]key\f[R] blank and fill in
\f[C]sas_url\f[R].
.PP
An account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL can be obtained from
the Azure portal or the Azure Storage Explorer.
To get a container level SAS URL right click on a container in the Azure
Blob explorer in the Azure portal.
.PP
If you use a container level SAS URL, rclone operations are permitted
only on a particular container, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone ls azureblob:container
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You can also list the single container from the root.
This will only show the container specified by the SAS URL.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone lsd azureblob:
container/
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that you can\[cq]t see or access any other containers \- this will
fail
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone ls azureblob:othercontainer
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Container level SAS URLs are useful for temporarily allowing third
parties access to a single container or putting credentials into an
untrusted environment such as a CI build server.
.SS Multipart uploads
.PP
Rclone supports multipart uploads with Azure Blob storage.
Files bigger than 256MB will be uploaded using chunked upload by
default.
.PP
The files will be uploaded in parallel in 4MB chunks (by default).
Note that these chunks are buffered in memory and there may be up to
\f[C]\-\-transfers\f[R] of them being uploaded at once.
.PP
Files can\[cq]t be split into more than 50,000 chunks so by default, so
the largest file that can be uploaded with 4MB chunk size is 195GB.
Above this rclone will double the chunk size until it creates less than
50,000 chunks.
By default this will mean a maximum file size of 3.2TB can be uploaded.
This can be raised to 5TB using
\f[C]\-\-azureblob\-chunk\-size 100M\f[R].
.PP
Note that rclone doesn\[cq]t commit the block list until the end of the
upload which means that there is a limit of 9.5TB of multipart uploads
in progress as Azure won\[cq]t allow more than that amount of
uncommitted blocks.

.PP
If there is no \[lq]access tier\[rq] specified, rclone doesn\[cq]t apply
any tier.
rclone performs \[lq]Set Tier\[rq] operation on blobs while uploading,
if objects are not modified, specifying \[lq]access tier\[rq] to new one
will have no effect.
If blobs are in \[lq]archive tier\[rq] at remote, trying to perform data

See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Microsoft.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[R] like this,
.PP
List directories in top level of your OneDrive
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd remote:

.SS Getting your own Client ID and Key
.PP
You can use your own Client ID if the default (\f[C]client_id\f[R] left
blank) one doesn\[cq]t work for you or you see lots of throttling.
The default Client ID and Key is shared by all rclone users when
performing requests.
.PP
If you are having problems with them (E.g., seeing a lot of throttling),
you can get your own Client ID and Key by following the steps below:
.IP "1." 3
Open
https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade,
then click \f[C]New registration\f[R].
.IP "2." 3
Enter a name for your app, choose account type
\f[C]Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory \- Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)\f[R],
select \f[C]Web\f[R] in \f[C]Redirect URI\f[R] Enter
\f[C]http://localhost:53682/\f[R] and click Register.
Copy and keep the \f[C]Application (client) ID\f[R] under the app name
for later use.
.IP "3." 3
Under \f[C]manage\f[R] select \f[C]Certificates & secrets\f[R], click
\f[C]New client secret\f[R].
Copy and keep that secret for later use.
.IP "4." 3
Under \f[C]manage\f[R] select \f[C]API permissions\f[R], click
\f[C]Add a permission\f[R] and select \f[C]Microsoft Graph\f[R] then
select \f[C]delegated permissions\f[R].
.IP "5." 3
Search and select the following permissions: \f[C]Files.Read\f[R],
\f[C]Files.ReadWrite\f[R], \f[C]Files.Read.All\f[R],
\f[C]Files.ReadWrite.All\f[R], \f[C]offline_access\f[R],
\f[C]User.Read\f[R].
Once selected click \f[C]Add permissions\f[R] at the bottom.
.PP
Now the application is complete.
Run \f[C]rclone config\f[R] to create or edit a OneDrive remote.
Supply the app ID and password as Client ID and Secret, respectively.
rclone will walk you through the remaining steps.
.SS Modification time and hashes

.SS Deleting files
.PP
Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.
Microsoft doesn\[cq]t provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to
empty the trash, so you will have to do that with one of Microsoft\[cq]s
apps or via the OneDrive website.

.SS Limitations
.SS Naming
.PP
Note that OneDrive is case insensitive so you can\[cq]t have a file
called \[lq]Hello.doc\[rq] and one called \[lq]hello.doc\[rq].
.PP
There are quite a few characters that can\[cq]t be in OneDrive file
names.
These can\[cq]t occur on Windows platforms, but on non\-Windows
platforms they are common.
Rclone will map these names to and from an identical looking unicode
equivalent.
For example if a file has a \f[C]?\f[R] in it will be mapped to
\f[C]\[uFF1F]\f[R] instead.
.SS File sizes
.PP
The largest allowed file sizes are 15GB for OneDrive for Business and
100GB for OneDrive Personal (Updated 19 May 2020).
Source:
https://support.office.com/en\-us/article/upload\-photos\-and\-files\-to\-onedrive\-b00ad3fe\-6643\-4b16\-9212\-de00ef02b586
.SS Path length
.PP
The entire path, including the file name, must contain fewer than 400
characters for OneDrive, OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online.
If you are encrypting file and folder names with rclone, you may want to
pay attention to this limitation because the encrypted names are
typically longer than the original ones.
.SS Number of files
.PP
OneDrive seems to be OK with at least 50,000 files in a folder, but at
100,000 rclone will get errors listing the directory like
\f[C]couldn\[cq]t list files: UnknownError:\f[R].
See #2707 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2707) for more info.
.PP
An official document about the limitations for different types of
OneDrive can be found
here (https://support.office.com/en-us/article/invalid-file-names-and-file-types-in-onedrive-onedrive-for-business-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa).
.SS Versioning issue
.PP
Every change in OneDrive causes the service to create a new version.
This counts against a users quota.
For example changing the modification time of a file creates a second
version, so the file is using twice the space.
.PP
The \f[C]copy\f[R] is the only rclone command affected by this as we
copy the file and then afterwards set the modification time to match the
source file.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R]: Starting October 2018, users will no longer be able to
disable versioning by default.
This is because Microsoft has brought an
update (https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-OneDrive-Blog/New-Updates-to-OneDrive-and-SharePoint-Team-Site-Versioning/ba-p/204390)
to the mechanism.
To change this new default setting, a PowerShell command is required to
be run by a SharePoint admin.
If you are an admin, you can run these commands in PowerShell to change
that setting:
.IP "1." 3
\f[C]Install\-Module \-Name Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell\f[R]
(in case you haven\[cq]t installed this already)
.IP "2." 3
\f[C]Import\-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell \-DisableNameChecking\f[R]
.IP "3." 3
\f[C]Connect\-SPOService \-Url https://YOURSITE\-admin.sharepoint.com \-Credential YOU\[at]YOURSITE.COM\f[R]
(replacing \f[C]YOURSITE\f[R], \f[C]YOU\f[R], \f[C]YOURSITE.COM\f[R]
with the actual values; this will prompt for your credentials)
.IP "4." 3
\f[C]Set\-SPOTenant \-EnableMinimumVersionRequirement $False\f[R]
.IP "5." 3
\f[C]Disconnect\-SPOService\f[R] (to disconnect from the server)
.PP
\f[I]Below are the steps for normal users to disable versioning. If you
don\[cq]t see the \[lq]No Versioning\[rq] option, make sure the above
requirements are met.\f[R]
.PP
User Weropol (https://github.com/Weropol) has found a method to disable
versioning on OneDrive
.IP "1." 3
Open the settings menu by clicking on the gear symbol at the top of the
OneDrive Business page.
.IP "2." 3
Click Site settings.
.IP "3." 3
Once on the Site settings page, navigate to Site Administration > Site
libraries and lists.
.IP "4." 3
Click Customize \[lq]Documents\[rq].
.IP "5." 3
Click General Settings > Versioning Settings.
.IP "6." 3
Under Document Version History select the option No versioning.
Note: This will disable the creation of new file versions, but will not
remove any previous versions.
Your documents are safe.
.IP "7." 3
Apply the changes by clicking OK.
.IP "8." 3
Use rclone to upload or modify files.
(I also use the \[en]no\-update\-modtime flag)
.IP "9." 3
Restore the versioning settings after using rclone.

.SS Troubleshooting
.SS Unexpected file size/hash differences on Sharepoint
.PP
It is a
known (https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs/issues/935#issuecomment-441741631)
issue that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for Business) silently
modifies uploaded files, mainly Office files (.docx, .xlsx, etc.),
causing file size and hash checks to fail.
To use rclone with such affected files on Sharepoint, you may disable
these checks with the following command line arguments:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-ignore\-checksum \-\-ignore\-size
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Replacing/deleting existing files on Sharepoint gets \[lq]item not found\[rq]
.PP
It is a
known (https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs/issues/1068) issue
that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for Business) may return
\[lq]item not found\[rq] errors when users try to replace or delete
uploaded files; this seems to mainly affect Office files (.docx, .xlsx,
etc.).
As a workaround, you may use the \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir <BACKUP_DIR>\f[R]
command line argument so rclone moves the files to be replaced/deleted
into a given backup directory (instead of directly replacing/deleting
them).
For example, to instruct rclone to move the files into the directory
\f[C]rclone\-backup\-dir\f[R] on backend \f[C]mysharepoint\f[R], you may
use:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-backup\-dir mysharepoint:rclone\-backup\-dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS access_denied (AADSTS65005)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Error: access_denied
Code: AADSTS65005
Description: Using application \[aq]rclone\[aq] is currently not supported for your organization [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] because it is in an unmanaged state. An administrator needs to claim ownership of the company by DNS validation of [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] before the application rclone can be provisioned.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This means that rclone can\[cq]t use the OneDrive for Business API with
your account.
You can\[cq]t do much about it, maybe write an email to your admins.
.PP
However, there are other ways to interact with your OneDrive account.
Have a look at the webdav backend: https://rclone.org/webdav/#sharepoint
.SS invalid_grant (AADSTS50076)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Error: invalid_grant
Code: AADSTS50076
Description: Due to a configuration change made by your administrator, or because you moved to a new location, you must use multi\-factor authentication to access \[aq]...\[aq].
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you see the error above after enabling multi\-factor authentication
for your account, you can fix it by refreshing your OAuth refresh token.
To do that, run \f[C]rclone config\f[R], and choose to edit your
OneDrive backend.
Then, you don\[cq]t need to actually make any changes until you reach
this question: \f[C]Already have a token \- refresh?\f[R].
For this question, answer \f[C]y\f[R] and go through the process to
refresh your token, just like the first time the backend is configured.
After this, rclone should work again for this backend.
.SS OpenDrive

.SS Configuration from an OpenStack credentials file
.PP
An OpenStack credentials file typically looks something something like
this (without the comments)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export OS_AUTH_URL=https://a.provider.net/v2.0
export OS_TENANT_ID=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
export OS_TENANT_NAME=\[dq]1234567890123456\[dq]
export OS_USERNAME=\[dq]123abc567xy\[dq]
echo \[dq]Please enter your OpenStack Password: \[dq]
read \-sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
export OS_REGION_NAME=\[dq]SBG1\[dq]
if [ \-z \[dq]$OS_REGION_NAME\[dq] ]; then unset OS_REGION_NAME; fi
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The config file needs to look something like this where
\f[C]$OS_USERNAME\f[R] represents the value of the \f[C]OS_USERNAME\f[R]
variable \- \f[C]123abc567xy\f[R] in the example above.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[remote]
type = swift
user = $OS_USERNAME
key = $OS_PASSWORD
auth = $OS_AUTH_URL
tenant = $OS_TENANT_NAME
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that you may (or may not) need to set \f[C]region\f[R] too \- try
without first.
.SS Configuration from the environment
.PP
If you prefer you can configure rclone to use swift using a standard set
of OpenStack environment variables.
.PP
When you run through the config, make sure you choose \f[C]true\f[R] for
\f[C]env_auth\f[R] and leave everything else blank.
.PP
rclone will then set any empty config parameters from the environment
using standard OpenStack environment variables.
There is a list of the
variables (https://godoc.org/github.com/ncw/swift#Connection.ApplyEnvironment)
in the docs for the swift library.
.SS Using an alternate authentication method
.PP
If your OpenStack installation uses a non\-standard authentication
method that might not be yet supported by rclone or the underlying swift
library, you can authenticate externally (e.g.\ calling manually the
\f[C]openstack\f[R] commands to get a token).
Then, you just need to pass the two configuration variables
\f[C]auth_token\f[R] and \f[C]storage_url\f[R].
If they are both provided, the other variables are ignored.
rclone will not try to authenticate but instead assume it is already
authenticated and use these two variables to access the OpenStack
installation.
.SS Using rclone without a config file
.PP
You can use rclone with swift without a config file, if desired, like
this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
source openstack\-credentials\-file
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_TYPE=swift
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_ENV_AUTH=true
rclone lsd myremote:
\f[R]
.fi
.SS \[en]fast\-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[R] which allows you to use
fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.SS \[en]update and \[en]use\-server\-modtime
.PP
As noted below, the modified time is stored on metadata on the object.
It is used by default for all operations that require checking the time
a file was last updated.
It allows rclone to treat the remote more like a true filesystem, but it
is inefficient because it requires an extra API call to retrieve the
metadata.
.PP
For many operations, the time the object was last uploaded to the remote
is sufficient to determine if it is \[lq]dirty\[rq].
By using \f[C]\-\-update\f[R] along with
\f[C]\-\-use\-server\-modtime\f[R], you can avoid the extra API call and
simply upload files whose local modtime is newer than the time it was
last uploaded.

accurate to 1 ns.

.SS Limitations
.PP
The Swift API doesn\[cq]t return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won\[cq]t check or use the
MD5SUM for these.
.SS Troubleshooting
.SS Rclone gives Failed to create file system for \[lq]remote:\[rq]: Bad Request
.PP
Due to an oddity of the underlying swift library, it gives a \[lq]Bad
Request\[rq] error rather than a more sensible error when the
authentication fails for Swift.
.PP
So this most likely means your username / password is wrong.
You can investigate further with the \f[C]\-\-dump\-bodies\f[R] flag.
.PP
This may also be caused by specifying the region when you shouldn\[cq]t
have (eg OVH).
.SS Rclone gives Failed to create file system: Response didn\[cq]t have storage url and auth token
.PP
This is most likely caused by forgetting to specify your tenant when
setting up a swift remote.
.SS pCloud
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[R]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.PP
The initial setup for pCloud involves getting a token from pCloud which
you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] walks you through it.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[R].
First run:

.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from pCloud.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[R] like this,
.PP
List directories in top level of your pCloud
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd remote:
\f[R]

.PP

.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy /home/source remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
pCloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
In order to set a Modification time pCloud requires the object be
re\-uploaded.
.PP
pCloud supports MD5 and SHA1 type hashes, so you can use the
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[R] flag.
.SS Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters) the following
characters are also replaced:

Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[cq]t
be used in JSON strings.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Deleted files will be moved to the trash.
Your subscription level will determine how long items stay in the trash.
\f[C]rclone cleanup\f[R] can be used to empty the trash.
.SS Root folder ID
.PP
You can set the \f[C]root_folder_id\f[R] for rclone.
This is the directory (identified by its \f[C]Folder ID\f[R]) that
rclone considers to be the root of your pCloud drive.
.PP
Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct
root to use itself.
.PP
However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.
.PP
In order to do this you will have to find the \f[C]Folder ID\f[R] of the
directory you wish rclone to display.
This will be the \f[C]folder\f[R] field of the URL when you open the
relevant folder in the pCloud web interface.
.PP
So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
\f[C]https://my.pcloud.com/#page=filemanager&folder=5xxxxxxxx8&tpl=foldergrid\f[R]
in the browser, then you use \f[C]5xxxxxxxx8\f[R] as the
\f[C]root_folder_id\f[R] in the config.

.SS Root mode vs Library mode

There are two distinct modes you can setup your remote: \- you point

\f[C]remote:library\f[R].
You may put subdirectories in too, eg
\f[C]remote:library/path/to/dir\f[R].
\- you point your remote to a specific library during the configuration:
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path/to/dir\f[R].
\f[B]This is the recommended mode when using encrypted libraries\f[R].
(\f[I]This mode is possibly slightly faster than the root mode\f[R])

.PP
Please note a share link is unique for each file or directory.
If you run a link command on a file/dir that has already been shared,
you will get the exact same link.
.SS Compatibility
.PP

.SS SFTP
.PP
SFTP is the Secure (or SSH) File Transfer
Protocol (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol).
.PP
The SFTP backend can be used with a number of different providers:
.IP \[bu] 2
C14
.IP \[bu] 2
rsync.net
.PP
SFTP runs over SSH v2 and is installed as standard with most modern SSH
installations.
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[R].
If the path does not begin with a \f[C]/\f[R] it is relative to the home
directory of the user.
An empty path \f[C]remote:\f[R] refers to the user\[cq]s home directory.
.PP
\[dq]Note that some SFTP servers will need the leading / \- Synology is
a good example of this.
rsync.net, on the other hand, requires users to OMIT the leading /.
.PP
Here is an example of making an SFTP configuration.
First run
.IP

\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This remote is called \f[C]remote\f[R] and can now be used like this:
.PP
See all directories in the home directory
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd remote:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Make a new directory
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone mkdir remote:path/to/directory
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
List the contents of a directory
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone ls remote:path/to/directory
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Sync \f[C]/home/local/directory\f[R] to the remote directory, deleting
any excess files in the directory.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:directory
\f[R]
.fi
.SS SSH Authentication
.PP
The SFTP remote supports three authentication methods:
.IP \[bu] 2
Password
.IP \[bu] 2
Key file
.IP \[bu] 2
ssh\-agent
.PP
Key files should be PEM\-encoded private key files.
For instance \f[C]/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa\f[R].
Only unencrypted OpenSSH or PEM encrypted files are supported.
.PP
The key file can be specified in either an external file (key_file) or
contained within the rclone config file (key_pem).
If using key_pem in the config file, the entry should be on a single
line with new line (`' or `') separating lines.
i.e.\ 
.PP
key_pem = \[em]\[en]BEGIN RSA PRIVATE
KEY\[em]\[en]0gAMbMbaSsd\[em]\[en]END RSA PRIVATE KEY\[em]\[en]
.PP
This will generate it correctly for key_pem for use in the config:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
awk \[aq]{printf \[dq]%s\[rs]\[rs]n\[dq], $0}\[aq] < \[ti]/.ssh/id_rsa
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you don\[cq]t specify \f[C]pass\f[R], \f[C]key_file\f[R], or
\f[C]key_pem\f[R] then rclone will attempt to contact an ssh\-agent.
.PP
You can also specify \f[C]key_use_agent\f[R] to force the usage of an
ssh\-agent.
In this case \f[C]key_file\f[R] or \f[C]key_pem\f[R] can also be
specified to force the usage of a specific key in the ssh\-agent.
.PP
Using an ssh\-agent is the only way to load encrypted OpenSSH keys at
the moment.
.PP
If you set the \f[C]\-\-sftp\-ask\-password\f[R] option, rclone will
prompt for a password when needed and no password has been configured.
.SS ssh\-agent on macOS
.PP
Note that there seem to be various problems with using an ssh\-agent on
macOS due to recent changes in the OS.
The most effective work\-around seems to be to start an ssh\-agent in
each session, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
eval \[ga]ssh\-agent \-s\[ga] && ssh\-add \-A
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And then at the end of the session
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
eval \[ga]ssh\-agent \-k\[ga]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
These commands can be used in scripts of course.
.SS Modified time
.PP
Modified times are stored on the server to 1 second precision.
.PP
Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported.
.PP
Some SFTP servers disable setting/modifying the file modification time
after upload (for example, certain configurations of ProFTPd with
mod_sftp).
If you are using one of these servers, you can set the option
\f[C]set_modtime = false\f[R] in your RClone backend configuration to
disable this behaviour.

.PP
SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and
\f[C]md5sum\f[R] or \f[C]sha1sum\f[R] as well as \f[C]echo\f[R] are in
the remote\[cq]s PATH.
This remote checksumming (file hashing) is recommended and enabled by
default.
Disabling the checksumming may be required if you are connecting to SFTP
servers which are not under your control, and to which the execution of
remote commands is prohibited.
Set the configuration option \f[C]disable_hashcheck\f[R] to
\f[C]true\f[R] to disable checksumming.
.PP
SFTP also supports \f[C]about\f[R] if the same login has shell access
and \f[C]df\f[R] are in the remote\[cq]s PATH.
\f[C]about\f[R] will return the total space, free space, and used space
on the remote for the disk of the specified path on the remote or, if
not set, the disk of the root on the remote.
\f[C]about\f[R] will fail if it does not have shell access or if
\f[C]df\f[R] is not in the remote\[cq]s PATH.
.PP
Note that some SFTP servers (eg Synology) the paths are different for
SSH and SFTP so the hashes can\[cq]t be calculated properly.
For them using \f[C]disable_hashcheck\f[R] is a good idea.
.PP
The only ssh agent supported under Windows is Putty\[cq]s pageant.
.PP
The Go SSH library disables the use of the aes128\-cbc cipher by
default, due to security concerns.
This can be re\-enabled on a per\-connection basis by setting the
\f[C]use_insecure_cipher\f[R] setting in the configuration file to
\f[C]true\f[R].
Further details on the insecurity of this cipher can be found [in this
paper] (http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/\[ti]kp/SandPfinal.pdf).
.PP
SFTP isn\[cq]t supported under plan9 until this
issue (https://github.com/pkg/sftp/issues/156) is fixed.
.PP
Note that since SFTP isn\[cq]t HTTP based the following flags don\[cq]t
work with it: \f[C]\-\-dump\-headers\f[R], \f[C]\-\-dump\-bodies\f[R],
\f[C]\-\-dump\-auth\f[R]
.PP
Note that \f[C]\-\-timeout\f[R] isn\[cq]t supported (but
\f[C]\-\-contimeout\f[R] is).

.SS SugarSync
.PP
SugarSync (https://sugarsync.com) is a cloud service that enables active
synchronization of files across computers and other devices for file
backup, access, syncing, and sharing.

.PP
Note that the config asks for your email and password but doesn\[cq]t
store them, it only uses them to get the initial token.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[R] like this,
.PP
List directories (sync folders) in top level of your SugarSync
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd remote:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
List all the files in your SugarSync folder \[lq]Test\[rq]
.IP

\f[C]
rclone ls remote:Test
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To copy a local directory to an SugarSync folder called backup
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy /home/source remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[R]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] you can\[cq]t create files in the top level folder you have
to create a folder, which rclone will create as a \[lq]Sync Folder\[rq]
with SugarSync.
.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
SugarSync does not support modification times or hashes, therefore
syncing will default to \f[C]\-\-size\-only\f[R] checking.
Note that using \f[C]\-\-update\f[R] will work as rclone can read the
time files were uploaded.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
SugarSync replaces the default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters) except for DEL.
.PP
Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[cq]t
be used in XML strings.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Deleted files will be moved to the \[lq]Deleted items\[rq] folder by
default.
.PP
However you can supply the flag \f[C]\-\-sugarsync\-hard\-delete\f[R] or
set the config parameter \f[C]hard_delete = true\f[R] if you would like
files to be deleted straight away.

.SS Tardigrade
.PP
Tardigrade (https://tardigrade.io) is an encrypted, secure, and
cost\-effective object storage service that enables you to store, back
up, and archive large amounts of data in a decentralized manner.
.SS Setup
.PP
To make a new Tardigrade configuration you need one of the following: *
Access Grant that someone else shared with you.
* API
Key (https://documentation.tardigrade.io/getting-started/uploading-your-first-object/create-an-api-key)
of a Tardigrade project you are a member of.

.SS Union
.PP
The \f[C]union\f[R] remote provides a unification similar to UnionFS
using other remotes.
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required or a local path, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R] or
\f[C]/directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.PP
During the initial setup with \f[C]rclone config\f[R] you will specify
the upstream remotes as a space separated list.
The upstream remotes can either be a local paths or other remotes.
.PP
Attribute \f[C]:ro\f[R] and \f[C]:nc\f[R] can be attach to the end of
path to tag the remote as \f[B]read only\f[R] or \f[B]no create\f[R], eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory:ro\f[R] or
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory:nc\f[R].
.PP
Subfolders can be used in upstream remotes.
Assume a union remote named \f[C]backup\f[R] with the remotes
\f[C]mydrive:private/backup\f[R].
Invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir backup:desktop\f[R] is exactly the same as
invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir mydrive2:/backup/desktop\f[R].
.PP
There will be no special handling of paths containing \f[C]..\f[R]
segments.
Invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir backup:../desktop\f[R] is exactly the same as
invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir mydrive2:/backup/../desktop\f[R].
.SS Behavior / Policies
.PP
The behavior of union backend is inspired by
trapexit/mergerfs (https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs).
All functions are grouped into 3 categories: \f[B]action\f[R],
\f[B]create\f[R] and \f[B]search\f[R].
These functions and categories can be assigned a policy which dictates
what file or directory is chosen when performing that behavior.
Any policy can be assigned to a function or category though some may not
be very useful in practice.
For instance: \f[B]rand\f[R] (random) may be useful for file creation
(create) but could lead to very odd behavior if used for
\f[C]delete\f[R] if there were more than one copy of the file.

.SS Path Preservation
.PP
Policies, as described below, are of two basic types.
\f[C]path preserving\f[R] and \f[C]non\-path preserving\f[R].
.PP
All policies which start with \f[C]ep\f[R] (\f[B]epff\f[R],
\f[B]eplfs\f[R], \f[B]eplus\f[R], \f[B]epmfs\f[R], \f[B]eprand\f[R]) are
\f[C]path preserving\f[R].
\f[C]ep\f[R] stands for \f[C]existing path\f[R].
.PP
A path preserving policy will only consider upstreams where the relative
path being accessed already exists.
.PP
When using non\-path preserving policies paths will be created in target
upstreams as necessary.
.SS Quota Relevant Policies
.PP
Some policies rely on quota information.
These policies should be used only if your upstreams support the
respective quota fields.

.PP
To check if your upstream supports the field, run
\f[C]rclone about remote: [flags]\f[R] and see if the required field
exists.
.SS Filters
.PP
Policies basically search upstream remotes and create a list of files /
paths for functions to work on.
The policy is responsible for filtering and sorting.
The policy type defines the sorting but filtering is mostly uniform as
described below.
.IP \[bu] 2
No \f[B]search\f[R] policies filter.
.IP \[bu] 2
All \f[B]action\f[R] policies will filter out remotes which are tagged
as \f[B]read\-only\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
All \f[B]create\f[R] policies will filter out remotes which are tagged
\f[B]read\-only\f[R] or \f[B]no\-create\f[R].
.PP
If all remotes are filtered an error will be returned.
.SS Policy descriptions
.PP
The policies definition are inspired by
trapexit/mergerfs (https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs) but not exactly
the same.
Some policy definition could be different due to the much larger latency
of remote file systems.

.SS Provider notes
.PP
See below for notes on specific providers.
.SS Owncloud
.PP
Click on the settings cog in the bottom right of the page and this will
show the WebDAV URL that rclone needs in the config step.
It will look something like
\f[C]https://example.com/remote.php/webdav/\f[R].
.PP
Owncloud supports modified times using the \f[C]X\-OC\-Mtime\f[R]
header.
.SS Nextcloud
.PP
This is configured in an identical way to Owncloud.
Note that Nextcloud does not support streaming of files (\f[C]rcat\f[R])
whereas Owncloud does.
This may be
fixed (https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud-snap/issues/365) in the
future.
.SS Sharepoint
.PP
Rclone can be used with Sharepoint provided by OneDrive for Business or
Office365 Education Accounts.
This feature is only needed for a few of these Accounts, mostly
Office365 Education ones.
These accounts are sometimes not verified by the domain owner
github#1975 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1975)
.PP
This means that these accounts can\[cq]t be added using the official API
(other Accounts should work with the \[lq]onedrive\[rq] option).
However, it is possible to access them using webdav.
.PP
To use a sharepoint remote with rclone, add it like this: First, you
need to get your remote\[cq]s URL:
.IP \[bu] 2
Go here (https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/signin/) to open your
OneDrive or to sign in
.IP \[bu] 2
Now take a look at your address bar, the URL should look like this:
\f[C]https://[YOUR\-DOMAIN]\-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR\-EMAIL]/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx\f[R]
.PP
You\[cq]ll only need this URL up to the email address.
After that, you\[cq]ll most likely want to add \[lq]/Documents\[rq].
That subdirectory contains the actual data stored on your OneDrive.
.PP
Add the remote to rclone like this: Configure the \f[C]url\f[R] as
\f[C]https://[YOUR\-DOMAIN]\-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR\-EMAIL]/Documents\f[R]
and use your normal account email and password for \f[C]user\f[R] and
\f[C]pass\f[R].
If you have 2FA enabled, you have to generate an app password.
Set the \f[C]vendor\f[R] to \f[C]sharepoint\f[R].
.PP
Your config file should look like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[sharepoint]
type = webdav
url = https://[YOUR\-DOMAIN]\-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR\-EMAIL]/Documents
vendor = other
user = YourEmailAddress
pass = encryptedpassword
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Required Flags for SharePoint
.PP
As SharePoint does some special things with uploaded documents, you
won\[cq]t be able to use the documents size or the documents hash to
compare if a file has been changed since the upload / which file is
newer.
.PP
For Rclone calls copying files (especially Office files such as .docx,
\&.xlsx, etc.) from/to SharePoint (like copy, sync, etc.), you should
append these flags to ensure Rclone uses the \[lq]Last Modified\[rq]
datetime property to compare your documents:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-ignore\-size \-\-ignore\-checksum \-\-update
\f[R]
.fi
.SS dCache
.PP
dCache is a storage system that supports many protocols and
authentication/authorisation schemes.
For WebDAV clients, it allows users to authenticate with username and
password (BASIC), X.509, Kerberos, and various bearer tokens, including
Macaroons (https://www.dcache.org/manuals/workshop-2017-05-29-Umea/000-Final/anupam_macaroons_v02.pdf)
and OpenID\-Connect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect)
access tokens.
.PP
Configure as normal using the \f[C]other\f[R] type.
Don\[cq]t enter a username or password, instead enter your Macaroon as
the \f[C]bearer_token\f[R].
.PP
The config will end up looking something like this.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[dcache]
type = webdav
url = https://dcache...
vendor = other
user =
pass =
bearer_token = your\-macaroon
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
There is a
script (https://github.com/sara-nl/GridScripts/blob/master/get-macaroon)
that obtains a Macaroon from a dCache WebDAV endpoint, and creates an
rclone config file.
.PP
Macaroons may also be obtained from the dCacheView
web\-browser/JavaScript client that comes with dCache.
.SS OpenID\-Connect
.PP
dCache also supports authenticating with OpenID\-Connect access tokens.
OpenID\-Connect is a protocol (based on OAuth 2.0) that allows services
to identify users who have authenticated with some central service.
.PP
Support for OpenID\-Connect in rclone is currently achieved using
another software package called
oidc\-agent (https://github.com/indigo-dc/oidc-agent).
This is a command\-line tool that facilitates obtaining an access token.
Once installed and configured, an access token is obtained by running
the \f[C]oidc\-token\f[R] command.
The following example shows a (shortened) access token obtained from the
\f[I]XDC\f[R] OIDC Provider.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
paul\[at]celebrimbor:\[ti]$ oidc\-token XDC
eyJraWQ[...]QFXDt0
paul\[at]celebrimbor:\[ti]$
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R] Before the \f[C]oidc\-token\f[R] command will work, the
refresh token must be loaded into the oidc agent.
This is done with the \f[C]oidc\-add\f[R] command (e.g.,
\f[C]oidc\-add XDC\f[R]).
This is typically done once per login session.
Full details on this and how to register oidc\-agent with your OIDC
Provider are provided in the oidc\-agent
documentation (https://indigo-dc.gitbooks.io/oidc-agent/).
.PP
The rclone \f[C]bearer_token_command\f[R] configuration option is used
to fetch the access token from oidc\-agent.
.PP
Configure as a normal WebDAV endpoint, using the `other' vendor, leaving
the username and password empty.
When prompted, choose to edit the advanced config and enter the command
to get a bearer token (e.g., \f[C]oidc\-agent XDC\f[R]).
.PP
The following example config shows a WebDAV endpoint that uses
oidc\-agent to supply an access token from the \f[I]XDC\f[R] OIDC
Provider.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[dcache]

.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Yandex Disk.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[R] like this,
.PP
See top level directories
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd remote:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP

excess files in the path.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:directory
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Yandex paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.SS Modified time
.PP
Modified times are supported and are stored accurate to 1 ns in custom
metadata called \f[C]rclone_modified\f[R] in RFC3339 with nanoseconds
format.
.SS MD5 checksums
.PP
MD5 checksums are natively supported by Yandex Disk.
.SS Emptying Trash
.PP
If you wish to empty your trash you can use the
\f[C]rclone cleanup remote:\f[R] command which will permanently delete
all your trashed files.
This command does not take any path arguments.
.SS Quota information
.PP
To view your current quota you can use the
\f[C]rclone about remote:\f[R] command which will display your usage
limit (quota) and the current usage.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
The default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters) are replaced.
.PP
Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[cq]t
be used in JSON strings.
.SS Limitations
.PP
When uploading very large files (bigger than about 5GB) you will need to
increase the \f[C]\-\-timeout\f[R] parameter.
This is because Yandex pauses (perhaps to calculate the MD5SUM for the
entire file) before returning confirmation that the file has been
uploaded.
The default handling of timeouts in rclone is to assume a 5 minute pause
is an error and close the connection \- you\[cq]ll see
\f[C]net/http: timeout awaiting response headers\f[R] errors in the logs
if this is happening.
Setting the timeout to twice the max size of file in GB should be
enough, so if you want to upload a 30GB file set a timeout of
\f[C]2 * 30 = 60m\f[R], that is \f[C]\-\-timeout 60m\f[R].

Local paths are specified as normal filesystem paths, eg
\f[C]/path/to/wherever\f[R], so
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync /home/source /tmp/destination
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Will sync \f[C]/home/source\f[R] to \f[C]/tmp/destination\f[R]
.PP
These can be configured into the config file for consistencies sake, but
it is probably easier not to.
.SS Modified time
.PP
Rclone reads and writes the modified time using an accuracy determined
by the OS.
Typically this is 1ns on Linux, 10 ns on Windows and 1 Second on OS X.
.SS Filenames
.PP
Filenames should be encoded in UTF\-8 on disk.
This is the normal case for Windows and OS X.
.PP
There is a bit more uncertainty in the Linux world, but new
distributions will have UTF\-8 encoded files names.
If you are using an old Linux filesystem with non UTF\-8 file names (eg
latin1) then you can use the \f[C]convmv\f[R] tool to convert the
filesystem to UTF\-8.
This tool is available in most distributions\[cq] package managers.
.PP
If an invalid (non\-UTF8) filename is read, the invalid characters will
be replaced with a quoted representation of the invalid bytes.
The name \f[C]gro\[rs]xdf\f[R] will be transferred as
\f[C]gro\[u201B]DF\f[R].
\f[C]rclone\f[R] will emit a debug message in this case (use
\f[C]\-v\f[R] to see), eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

.PP
Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[cq]t
be converted to UTF\-16.
.SS Long paths on Windows
.PP
Rclone handles long paths automatically, by converting all paths to long
UNC
paths (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx#maxpath)
which allows paths up to 32,767 characters.
.PP
This is why you will see that your paths, for instance
\f[C]c:\[rs]files\f[R] is converted to the UNC path
\f[C]\[rs]\[rs]?\[rs]c:\[rs]files\f[R] in the output, and
\f[C]\[rs]\[rs]server\[rs]share\f[R] is converted to
\f[C]\[rs]\[rs]?\[rs]UNC\[rs]server\[rs]share\f[R].
.PP
However, in rare cases this may cause problems with buggy file system
drivers like EncFS (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/261).
To disable UNC conversion globally, add this to your
\f[C].rclone.conf\f[R] file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[local]
nounc = true
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you want to selectively disable UNC, you can add it to a separate
entry like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[nounc]
type = local
nounc = true
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And use rclone like this:
.PP
\f[C]rclone copy c:\[rs]src nounc:z:\[rs]dst\f[R]
.PP
This will use UNC paths on \f[C]c:\[rs]src\f[R] but not on
\f[C]z:\[rs]dst\f[R].
Of course this will cause problems if the absolute path length of a file
exceeds 258 characters on z, so only use this option if you have to.
.SS Symlinks / Junction points
.PP
Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).
.PP
If you supply \f[C]\-\-copy\-links\f[R] or \f[C]\-L\f[R] then rclone
will follow the symlink and copy the pointed to file or directory.
Note that this flag is incompatible with \f[C]\-links\f[R] /
\f[C]\-l\f[R].
.PP
This flag applies to all commands.
.PP
For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ tree /tmp/a
/tmp/a
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] b \-> ../b
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] expected \-> ../expected
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] one
\[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] two
    \[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] three
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then you can see the difference with and without the flag like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone ls /tmp/a
        6 one
        6 two/three
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
and
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone \-L ls /tmp/a
     4174 expected
        6 one
        6 two/three
        6 b/two
        6 b/one
\f[R]
.fi
.SS \[en]links, \-l
.PP
Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).
.PP
If you supply this flag then rclone will copy symbolic links from the
local storage, and store them as text files, with a `.rclonelink' suffix
in the remote storage.
.PP
The text file will contain the target of the symbolic link (see
example).
.PP
This flag applies to all commands.
.PP
For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ tree /tmp/a
/tmp/a
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] file1 \-> ./file4
\[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] file2 \-> /home/user/file3
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Copying the entire directory with `\-l'
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone copyto \-l /tmp/a/file1 remote:/tmp/a/
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The remote files are created with a `.rclonelink' suffix
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone ls remote:/tmp/a
       5 file1.rclonelink
      14 file2.rclonelink
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The remote files will contain the target of the symbolic links
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone cat remote:/tmp/a/file1.rclonelink
\&./file4

$ rclone cat remote:/tmp/a/file2.rclonelink
/home/user/file3
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Copying them back with `\-l'
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone copyto \-l remote:/tmp/a/ /tmp/b/

$ tree /tmp/b
/tmp/b
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] file1 \-> ./file4
\[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] file2 \-> /home/user/file3
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
However, if copied back without `\-l'
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone copyto remote:/tmp/a/ /tmp/b/

$ tree /tmp/b
/tmp/b
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] file1.rclonelink
\[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] file2.rclonelink
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that this flag is incompatible with \f[C]\-copy\-links\f[R] /
\f[C]\-L\f[R].
.SS Restricting filesystems with \[en]one\-file\-system
.PP
Normally rclone will recurse through filesystems as mounted.
.PP
However if you set \f[C]\-\-one\-file\-system\f[R] or \f[C]\-x\f[R] this
tells rclone to stay in the filesystem specified by the root and not to
recurse into different file systems.
.PP
For example if you have a directory hierarchy like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
root
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] disk1     \- disk1 mounted on the root
\[br]\ \  \[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] file3 \- stored on disk1
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] disk2     \- disk2 mounted on the root
\[br]\ \  \[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] file4 \- stored on disk12
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] file1     \- stored on the root disk
\[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] file2     \- stored on the root disk
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Using \f[C]rclone \-\-one\-file\-system copy root remote:\f[R] will only
copy \f[C]file1\f[R] and \f[C]file2\f[R].
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone \-q \-\-one\-file\-system ls root
        0 file1
        0 file2
\f[R]
.fi
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone \-q ls root
        0 disk1/file3
        0 disk2/file4
        0 file1
        0 file2
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] Rclone (like most unix tools such as \f[C]du\f[R],
\f[C]rsync\f[R] and \f[C]tar\f[R]) treats a bind mount to the same
device as being on the same filesystem.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] This flag is only available on Unix based systems.
On systems where it isn\[cq]t supported (eg Windows) it will be ignored.

.SH Bugs and Limitations
.SS Limitations
.SS Directory timestamps aren\[cq]t preserved
.PP
Rclone doesn\[cq]t currently preserve the timestamps of directories.
This is because rclone only really considers objects when syncing.
.SS Rclone struggles with millions of files in a directory
.PP
Currently rclone loads each directory entirely into memory before using
it.
Since each Rclone object takes 0.5k\-1k of memory this can take a very
long time and use an extremely large amount of memory.
.PP
Millions of files in a directory tend caused by software writing cloud
storage (eg S3 buckets).
.SS Bucket based remotes and folders
.PP
Bucket based remotes (eg S3/GCS/Swift/B2) do not have a concept of
directories.
Rclone therefore cannot create directories in them which means that
empty directories on a bucket based remote will tend to disappear.
.PP
Some software creates empty keys ending in \f[C]/\f[R] as directory
markers.
Rclone doesn\[cq]t do this as it potentially creates more objects and
costs more.
It may do in future (probably with a flag).

.SS Frequently Asked Questions
.SS Do all cloud storage systems support all rclone commands
.PP
Yes they do.
All the rclone commands (eg \f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R] etc) will
work on all the remote storage systems.
.SS Can I copy the config from one machine to another
.PP
Sure! Rclone stores all of its config in a single file.
If you want to find this file, run \f[C]rclone config file\f[R] which
will tell you where it is.
.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for more
info.
.SS How do I configure rclone on a remote / headless box with no browser?
.PP
This has now been documented in its own remote setup
page (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/).
.SS Can rclone sync directly from drive to s3
.PP
Rclone can sync between two remote cloud storage systems just fine.
.PP
Note that it effectively downloads the file and uploads it again, so the
node running rclone would need to have lots of bandwidth.
.PP
The syncs would be incremental (on a file by file basis).
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync drive:Folder s3:bucket
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Using rclone from multiple locations at the same time
.PP
You can use rclone from multiple places at the same time if you choose
different subdirectory for the output, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Server A> rclone sync /tmp/whatever remote:ServerA
Server B> rclone sync /tmp/whatever remote:ServerB
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you sync to the same directory then you should use rclone copy
otherwise the two instances of rclone may delete each other\[cq]s files,
eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Server A> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup
Server B> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The file names you upload from Server A and Server B should be different
in this case, otherwise some file systems (eg Drive) may make
duplicates.
.SS Why doesn\[cq]t rclone support partial transfers / binary diffs like rsync?
.PP
Rclone stores each file you transfer as a native object on the remote
cloud storage system.
This means that you can see the files you upload as expected using
alternative access methods (eg using the Google Drive web interface).
There is a 1:1 mapping between files on your hard disk and objects
created in the cloud storage system.
.PP
Cloud storage systems (at least none I\[cq]ve come across yet) don\[cq]t
support partially uploading an object.
You can\[cq]t take an existing object, and change some bytes in the
middle of it.
.PP
It would be possible to make a sync system which stored binary diffs
instead of whole objects like rclone does, but that would break the 1:1
mapping of files on your hard disk to objects in the remote cloud
storage system.
.PP
All the cloud storage systems support partial downloads of content, so
it would be possible to make partial downloads work.
However to make this work efficiently this would require storing a
significant amount of metadata, which breaks the desired 1:1 mapping of
files to objects.
.SS Can rclone do bi\-directional sync?
.PP
No, not at present.
rclone only does uni\-directional sync from A \-> B.
It may do in the future though since it has all the primitives \- it
just requires writing the algorithm to do it.
.SS Can I use rclone with an HTTP proxy?
.PP
Yes.
rclone will follow the standard environment variables for proxies,
similar to cURL and other programs.
.PP
In general the variables are called \f[C]http_proxy\f[R] (for services
reached over \f[C]http\f[R]) and \f[C]https_proxy\f[R] (for services
reached over \f[C]https\f[R]).
Most public services will be using \f[C]https\f[R], but you may wish to
set both.
.PP
The content of the variable is \f[C]protocol://server:port\f[R].
The protocol value is the one used to talk to the proxy server, itself,
and is commonly either \f[C]http\f[R] or \f[C]socks5\f[R].
.PP
Slightly annoyingly, there is no \f[I]standard\f[R] for the name; some
applications may use \f[C]http_proxy\f[R] but another one
\f[C]HTTP_PROXY\f[R].
The \f[C]Go\f[R] libraries used by \f[C]rclone\f[R] will try both
variations, but you may wish to set all possibilities.
So, on Linux, you may end up with code similar to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export http_proxy=http://proxyserver:12345
export https_proxy=$http_proxy
export HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY=$http_proxy
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The \f[C]NO_PROXY\f[R] allows you to disable the proxy for specific
hosts.
Hosts must be comma separated, and can contain domains or parts.
For instance \[lq]foo.com\[rq] also matches \[lq]bar.foo.com\[rq].
.PP
e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.0/8,my.host.name
export NO_PROXY=$no_proxy
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that the ftp backend does not support \f[C]ftp_proxy\f[R] yet.
.SS Rclone gives x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided error
.PP
This means that \f[C]rclone\f[R] can\[cq]t file the SSL root
certificates.
Likely you are running \f[C]rclone\f[R] on a NAS with a cut\-down Linux
OS, or possibly on Solaris.
.PP
Rclone (via the Go runtime) tries to load the root certificates from
these places on Linux.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\[dq]/etc/ssl/certs/ca\-certificates.crt\[dq], // Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo etc.
\[dq]/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca\-bundle.crt\[dq],   // Fedora/RHEL
\[dq]/etc/ssl/ca\-bundle.pem\[dq],             // OpenSUSE
\[dq]/etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem\[dq],            // OpenELEC
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
So doing something like this should fix the problem.
It also sets the time which is important for SSL to work properly.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
mkdir \-p /etc/ssl/certs/
curl \-o /etc/ssl/certs/ca\-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca\-bundle/master/ca\-bundle.crt
ntpclient \-s \-h pool.ntp.org
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The two environment variables \f[C]SSL_CERT_FILE\f[R] and
\f[C]SSL_CERT_DIR\f[R], mentioned in the x509
package (https://godoc.org/crypto/x509), provide an additional way to
provide the SSL root certificates.
.PP
Note that you may need to add the \f[C]\-\-insecure\f[R] option to the
\f[C]curl\f[R] command line if it doesn\[cq]t work without.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
curl \-\-insecure \-o /etc/ssl/certs/ca\-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca\-bundle/master/ca\-bundle.crt
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Rclone gives Failed to load config file: function not implemented error
.PP
Likely this means that you are running rclone on Linux version not
supported by the go runtime, ie earlier than version 2.6.23.
.PP
See the system requirements section in the go install
docs (https://golang.org/doc/install) for full details.
.SS All my uploaded docx/xlsx/pptx files appear as archive/zip
.PP
This is caused by uploading these files from a Windows computer which
hasn\[cq]t got the Microsoft Office suite installed.
The easiest way to fix is to install the Word viewer and the Microsoft
Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 and later
versions\[cq] file formats
.SS tcp lookup some.domain.com no such host
.PP
This happens when rclone cannot resolve a domain.
Please check that your DNS setup is generally working, e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# both should print a long list of possible IP addresses
dig www.googleapis.com          # resolve using your default DNS
dig www.googleapis.com \[at]8.8.8.8 # resolve with Google\[aq]s DNS server
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you are using \f[C]systemd\-resolved\f[R] (default on Arch Linux),
ensure it is at version 233 or higher.
Previous releases contain a bug which causes not all domains to be
resolved properly.
.PP
Additionally with the \f[C]GODEBUG=netdns=\f[R] environment variable the
Go resolver decision can be influenced.
This also allows to resolve certain issues with DNS resolution.
See the name resolution section in the go
docs (https://golang.org/pkg/net/#hdr-Name_Resolution).
.SS The total size reported in the stats for a sync is wrong and keeps changing
.PP
It is likely you have more than 10,000 files that need to be synced.
By default rclone only gets 10,000 files ahead in a sync so as not to
use up too much memory.
You can change this default with the
\[en]max\-backlog (https://rclone.org/docs/#max-backlog-n) flag.
.SS Rclone is using too much memory or appears to have a memory leak
.PP
Rclone is written in Go which uses a garbage collector.
The default settings for the garbage collector mean that it runs when
the heap size has doubled.
.PP
However it is possible to tune the garbage collector to use less memory
by setting GOGC (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/gogc) to a lower value, say
\f[C]export GOGC=20\f[R].
This will make the garbage collector work harder, reducing memory size
at the expense of CPU usage.
.PP
The most common cause of rclone using lots of memory is a single
directory with thousands or millions of files in.
Rclone has to load this entirely into memory as rclone objects.
Each rclone object takes 0.5k\-1k of memory.
