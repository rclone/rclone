.SS Install with docker
.PP
The rclone maintains a docker image for
rclone (https://hub.docker.com/r/rclone/rclone).
These images are autobuilt by docker hub from the rclone source based on
a minimal Alpine linux image.
.PP
The \f[C]:latest\f[] tag will always point to the latest stable release.
You can use the \f[C]:beta\f[] tag to get the latest build from master.
You can also use version tags, eg \f[C]:1.49.1\f[], \f[C]:1.49\f[] or
\f[C]:1\f[].
.IP
.nf

\f[]
.fi
.PP
There are a few command line options to consider when starting an rclone
Docker container from the rclone image.
.IP \[bu] 2
You need to mount the host rclone config dir at \f[C]/config/rclone\f[]
into the Docker container.
Due to the fact that rclone updates tokens inside its config file, and
that the update process involves a file rename, you need to mount the
whole host rclone config dir, not just the single host rclone config
file.
.IP \[bu] 2
You need to mount a host data dir at \f[C]/data\f[] into the Docker
container.
.IP \[bu] 2
By default, the rclone binary inside a Docker container runs with UID=0
(root).
As a result, all files created in a run will have UID=0.
If your config and data files reside on the host with a non\-root
UID:GID, you need to pass these on the container start command line.
.IP \[bu] 2
It is possible to use \f[C]rclone\ mount\f[] inside a userspace Docker
container, and expose the resulting fuse mount to the host.
The exact \f[C]docker\ run\f[] options to do that might vary slightly
between hosts.
See, e.g.\ the discussion in this
thread (https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/9448).
.RS 2
.PP
You also need to mount the host \f[C]/etc/passwd\f[] and
\f[C]/etc/group\f[] for fuse to work inside the container.
.RE
.PP
Here are some commands tested on an Ubuntu 18.04.3 host:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ config\ on\ host\ at\ ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
#\ data\ on\ host\ at\ ~/data

#\ make\ sure\ the\ config\ is\ ok\ by\ listing\ the\ remotes
docker\ run\ \-\-rm\ \\
\ \ \ \ \-\-volume\ ~/.config/rclone:/config/rclone\ \\

\ \ \ \ mount\ dropbox:Photos\ /data/mount\ &
ls\ ~/data/mount
kill\ %1
\f[]
.fi
.SS Install from source
.PP
Make sure you have at least Go (https://golang.org/) 1.7 installed.
Download go (https://golang.org/dl/) if necessary.
The latest release is recommended.
Then
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
git\ clone\ https://github.com/rclone/rclone.git
cd\ rclone
go\ build
\&./rclone\ version
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You can also build and install rclone in the
GOPATH (https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH) (which defaults to
\f[C]~/go\f[]) with:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
go\ get\ \-u\ \-v\ github.com/rclone/rclone
\f[]
.fi
.PP
and this will build the binary in \f[C]$GOPATH/bin\f[]
(\f[C]~/go/bin/rclone\f[] by default) after downloading the source to
\f[C]$GOPATH/src/github.com/rclone/rclone\f[]
(\f[C]~/go/src/github.com/rclone/rclone\f[] by default).
.SS Installation with Ansible
.PP
This can be done with Stefan Weichinger's ansible
role (https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone).
.PP
Instructions
.IP "1." 3
\f[C]git\ clone\ https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible\-rclone.git\f[]
into your local roles\-directory
.IP "2." 3
add the role to the hosts you want rclone installed to:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ \ \ \ \-\ hosts:\ rclone\-hosts
\ \ \ \ \ \ roles:
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ rclone
\f[]
.fi
.SS Configure
.PP
First, you'll need to configure rclone.
As the object storage systems have quite complicated authentication
these are kept in a config file.
(See the \f[C]\-\-config\f[] entry for how to find the config file and
choose its location.)
.PP
The easiest way to make the config is to run rclone with the config
option:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ config
\f[]
.fi

.SS Usage
.PP
Rclone syncs a directory tree from one storage system to another.
.PP
Its syntax is like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Syntax:\ [options]\ subcommand\ <parameters>\ <parameters...>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Source and destination paths are specified by the name you gave the
storage system in the config file then the sub path, eg
\[lq]drive:myfolder\[rq] to look at \[lq]myfolder\[rq] in Google drive.
.PP
You can define as many storage paths as you like in the config file.
.SS Subcommands
.PP
rclone uses a system of subcommands.
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ ls\ remote:path\ #\ lists\ a\ remote
rclone\ copy\ /local/path\ remote:path\ #\ copies\ /local/path\ to\ the\ remote
rclone\ sync\ /local/path\ remote:path\ #\ syncs\ /local/path\ to\ the\ remote
\f[]
.fi
.SS rclone config

.SS rclone copy
.PP
Copy files from source to dest, skipping already copied
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Copy the source to the destination.
Doesn't transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification time
or MD5SUM.
Doesn't delete files from the destination.
.PP
Note that it is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not
the directory so when source:path is a directory, it's the contents of
source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.
.PP
If dest:path doesn't exist, it is created and the source:path contents
go there.
.PP
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ source:sourcepath\ dest:destpath
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Let's say there are two files in sourcepath
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sourcepath/one.txt
sourcepath/two.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This copies them to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
destpath/one.txt
destpath/two.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Not to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
destpath/sourcepath/one.txt
destpath/sourcepath/two.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you are familiar with \f[C]rsync\f[], rclone always works as if you
had written a trailing / \- meaning \[lq]copy the contents of this
directory\[rq].
This applies to all commands and whether you are talking about the
source or destination.
.PP
See the \[en]no\-traverse (/docs/#no-traverse) option for controlling
whether rclone lists the destination directory or not.
Supplying this option when copying a small number of files into a large
destination can speed transfers up greatly.
.PP
For example, if you have many files in /path/to/src but only a few of
them change every day, you can to copy all the files which have changed
recently very efficiently like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ \-\-max\-age\ 24h\ \-\-no\-traverse\ /path/to/src\ remote:
\f[]
.fi
.PP

.SS rclone sync
.PP
Make source and dest identical, modifying destination only.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only.
Doesn't transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification time
or MD5SUM.
Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files if
necessary.
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[]: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
\f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] flag to see exactly what would be copied and
deleted.
.PP
Note that files in the destination won't be deleted if there were any
errors at any point.
.PP
It is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not the
directory so when source:path is a directory, it's the contents of
source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.
See extended explanation in the \f[C]copy\f[] command above if unsure.
.PP
If dest:path doesn't exist, it is created and the source:path contents
go there.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[]: Use the \f[C]\-P\f[]/\f[C]\-\-progress\f[] flag to view

.SS rclone move
.PP
Move files from source to dest.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination directory.
Rclone will error if the source and destination overlap and the remote
does not support a server side directory move operation.
.PP
If no filters are in use and if possible this will server side move
\f[C]source:path\f[] into \f[C]dest:path\f[].
After this \f[C]source:path\f[] will no longer longer exist.
.PP
Otherwise for each file in \f[C]source:path\f[] selected by the filters
(if any) this will move it into \f[C]dest:path\f[].
If possible a server side move will be used, otherwise it will copy it
(server side if possible) into \f[C]dest:path\f[] then delete the
original (if no errors on copy) in \f[C]source:path\f[].
.PP
If you want to delete empty source directories after move, use the
\[en]delete\-empty\-src\-dirs flag.
.PP
See the \[en]no\-traverse (/docs/#no-traverse) option for controlling
whether rclone lists the destination directory or not.
Supplying this option when moving a small number of files into a large
destination can speed transfers up greatly.

.SS rclone delete
.PP
Remove the contents of path.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Remove the files in path.
Unlike \f[C]purge\f[] it obeys include/exclude filters so can be used to
selectively delete files.
.PP
\f[C]rclone\ delete\f[] only deletes objects but leaves the directory
structure alone.
If you want to delete a directory and all of its contents use
\f[C]rclone\ purge\f[]
.PP
Eg delete all files bigger than 100MBytes
.PP

.SS rclone check
.PP
Checks the files in the source and destination match.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Checks the files in the source and destination match.
It compares sizes and hashes (MD5 or SHA1) and logs a report of files
which don't match.
It doesn't alter the source or destination.
.PP
If you supply the \[en]size\-only flag, it will only compare the sizes
not the hashes as well.
Use this for a quick check.
.PP
If you supply the \[en]download flag, it will download the data from
both remotes and check them against each other on the fly.
This can be useful for remotes that don't support hashes or if you
really want to check all the data.
.PP
If you supply the \[en]one\-way flag, it will only check that files in
source match the files in destination, not the other way around.
Meaning extra files in destination that are not in the source will not
trigger an error.

.SS rclone dedupe
.PP
Interactively find duplicate files and delete/rename them.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
By default \f[C]dedupe\f[] interactively finds duplicate files and
offers to delete all but one or rename them to be different.
Only useful with Google Drive which can have duplicate file names.
.PP
In the first pass it will merge directories with the same name.
It will do this iteratively until all the identical directories have
been merged.
.PP
The \f[C]dedupe\f[] command will delete all but one of any identical
(same md5sum) files it finds without confirmation.
This means that for most duplicated files the \f[C]dedupe\f[] command
will not be interactive.
You can use \f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] to see what would happen without doing
anything.

Cryptcheck checks the integrity of a crypted remote.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone cryptcheck checks a remote against a crypted remote.
This is the equivalent of running rclone check, but able to check the
checksums of the crypted remote.
.PP
For it to work the underlying remote of the cryptedremote must support
some kind of checksum.
.PP
It works by reading the nonce from each file on the cryptedremote: and
using that to encrypt each file on the remote:.
It then checks the checksum of the underlying file on the cryptedremote:
against the checksum of the file it has just encrypted.
.PP
Use it like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ cryptcheck\ /path/to/files\ encryptedremote:path
\f[]

source match the files in destination, not the other way around.

.SS rclone lsf
.PP
List directories and objects in remote:path formatted for parsing
.SS Synopsis
.PP
List the contents of the source path (directories and objects) to
standard output in a form which is easy to parse by scripts.
By default this will just be the names of the objects and directories,
one per line.
The directories will have a / suffix.
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ lsf\ swift:bucket
bevajer5jef
canole
diwogej7
ferejej3gux/
fubuwic
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Use the \[en]format option to control what gets listed.
By default this is just the path, but you can use these parameters to
control the output:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
p\ \-\ path
s\ \-\ size
t\ \-\ modification\ time
h\ \-\ hash
i\ \-\ ID\ of\ object
o\ \-\ Original\ ID\ of\ underlying\ object
m\ \-\ MimeType\ of\ object\ if\ known
e\ \-\ encrypted\ name
T\ \-\ tier\ of\ storage\ if\ known,\ eg\ "Hot"\ or\ "Cool"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
So if you wanted the path, size and modification time, you would use
\[en]format \[lq]pst\[rq], or maybe \[en]format \[lq]tsp\[rq] to put the
path last.
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ lsf\ \ \-\-format\ "tsp"\ swift:bucket

2016\-06\-25\ 18:55:40;37600;fubuwic
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you specify \[lq]h\[rq] in the format you will get the MD5 hash by
default, use the \[lq]\[en]hash\[rq] flag to change which hash you want.
Note that this can be returned as an empty string if it isn't available
on the object (and for directories), \[lq]ERROR\[rq] if there was an
error reading it from the object and \[lq]UNSUPPORTED\[rq] if that
object does not support that hash type.
.PP
For example to emulate the md5sum command you can use
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ lsf\ \-R\ \-\-hash\ MD5\ \-\-format\ hp\ \-\-separator\ "\ \ "\ \-\-files\-only\ .

(Though \[lq]rclone md5sum .\[rq] is an easier way of typing this.)
.PP
By default the separator is \[lq];\[rq] this can be changed with the
\[en]separator flag.

good strategy.

.SS rclone mount
.PP
Mount the remote as file system on a mountpoint.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone mount allows Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows to mount any of
Rclone's cloud storage systems as a file system with FUSE.
.PP
First set up your remote using \f[C]rclone\ config\f[].
Check it works with \f[C]rclone\ ls\f[] etc.
.PP
Start the mount like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ mount\ remote:path/to/files\ /path/to/local/mount
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Or on Windows like this where X: is an unused drive letter
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ mount\ remote:path/to/files\ X:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
When the program ends, either via Ctrl+C or receiving a SIGINT or
SIGTERM signal, the mount is automatically stopped.
.PP
The umount operation can fail, for example when the mountpoint is busy.
When that happens, it is the user's responsibility to stop the mount
manually with
.IP

#\ OS\ X

.SS Installing on Windows
.PP
To run rclone mount on Windows, you will need to download and install
WinFsp (http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/).
.PP
WinFsp is an open source (https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp) Windows
File System Proxy which makes it easy to write user space file systems
for Windows.
It provides a FUSE emulation layer which rclone uses combination with
cgofuse (https://github.com/billziss-gh/cgofuse).
Both of these packages are by Bill Zissimopoulos who was very helpful
during the implementation of rclone mount for Windows.
.SS Windows caveats
.PP
Note that drives created as Administrator are not visible by other
accounts (including the account that was elevated as Administrator).
So if you start a Windows drive from an Administrative Command Prompt
and then try to access the same drive from Explorer (which does not run
as Administrator), you will not be able to see the new drive.
.PP
The easiest way around this is to start the drive from a normal command
prompt.
It is also possible to start a drive from the SYSTEM account (using the
WinFsp.Launcher
infrastructure (https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp/wiki/WinFsp-Service-Architecture))
which creates drives accessible for everyone on the system or
alternatively using the nssm service manager (https://nssm.cc/usage).
.SS Limitations
.PP
Without the use of \[lq]\[en]vfs\-cache\-mode\[rq] this can only write
files sequentially, it can only seek when reading.
This means that many applications won't work with their files on an
rclone mount without \[lq]\[en]vfs\-cache\-mode writes\[rq] or
\[lq]\[en]vfs\-cache\-mode full\[rq].
See the File Caching section for more info.
.PP
The bucket based remotes (eg Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2,
Hubic) do not support the concept of empty directories, so empty
directories will have a tendency to disappear once they fall out of the
directory cache.
.PP
Only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OS X and Windows at the moment.
.SS rclone mount vs rclone sync/copy
.PP
File systems expect things to be 100% reliable, whereas cloud storage
systems are a long way from 100% reliable.
The rclone sync/copy commands cope with this with lots of retries.
However rclone mount can't use retries in the same way without making
local copies of the uploads.
Look at the file caching for solutions to make mount more reliable.
.SS Attribute caching
.PP
You can use the flag \[en]attr\-timeout to set the time the kernel
caches the attributes (size, modification time etc) for directory
entries.
.PP
The default is \[lq]1s\[rq] which caches files just long enough to avoid
too many callbacks to rclone from the kernel.
.PP
In theory 0s should be the correct value for filesystems which can
change outside the control of the kernel.
However this causes quite a few problems such as rclone using too much
memory (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2157), rclone not
serving files to
samba (https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-1-39-vs-1-40-mount-issue/5112)
and excessive time listing
directories (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2095#issuecomment-371141147).
.PP
The kernel can cache the info about a file for the time given by
\[lq]\[en]attr\-timeout\[rq].
You may see corruption if the remote file changes length during this
window.
It will show up as either a truncated file or a file with garbage on the
end.
With \[lq]\[en]attr\-timeout 1s\[rq] this is very unlikely but not
impossible.
The higher you set \[lq]\[en]attr\-timeout\[rq] the more likely it is.
The default setting of \[lq]1s\[rq] is the lowest setting which
mitigates the problems above.
.PP
If you set it higher (`10s' or `1m' say) then the kernel will call back
to rclone less often making it more efficient, however there is more
chance of the corruption issue above.
.PP
If files don't change on the remote outside of the control of rclone
then there is no chance of corruption.
.PP
This is the same as setting the attr_timeout option in mount.fuse.
.SS Filters
.PP
Note that all the rclone filters can be used to select a subset of the
files to be visible in the mount.
.SS systemd
.PP
When running rclone mount as a systemd service, it is possible to use
Type=notify.
In this case the service will enter the started state after the
mountpoint has been successfully set up.
Units having the rclone mount service specified as a requirement will
see all files and folders immediately in this mode.
.SS chunked reading
.PP
\[en]vfs\-read\-chunk\-size will enable reading the source objects in
parts.
This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting
only chunks from the remote that are actually read at the cost of an
increased number of requests.
.PP
When \[en]vfs\-read\-chunk\-size\-limit is also specified and greater
than \[en]vfs\-read\-chunk\-size, the chunk size for each open file will
get doubled for each chunk read, until the specified value is reached.
A value of \-1 will disable the limit and the chunk size will grow
indefinitely.
.PP
With \[en]vfs\-read\-chunk\-size 100M and
\[en]vfs\-read\-chunk\-size\-limit 0 the following parts will be
downloaded: 0\-100M, 100M\-200M, 200M\-300M, 300M\-400M and so on.
When \[en]vfs\-read\-chunk\-size\-limit 500M is specified, the result
would be 0\-100M, 100M\-300M, 300M\-700M, 700M\-1200M, 1200M\-1700M and
so on.
.PP
Chunked reading will only work with \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode < full, as the
file will always be copied to the vfs cache before opening with
\[en]vfs\-cache\-mode full.
.SS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]\-\-dir\-cache\-time\f[] flag, you can set how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate
the cache.
However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once the
cache expires.
.PP
Alternatively, you can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[] signal to rclone for it to
flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill\ \-SIGHUP\ $(pidof\ rclone)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control (/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ rc\ vfs/forget
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ rc\ vfs/forget\ file=path/to/file\ dir=path/to/dir
\f[]
.fi
.SS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\f[] flag determines the amount of memory, that
will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file descriptor will try to keep the specified amount of data
in memory at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one file descriptor and won't be shared
between multiple open file descriptors of the same file.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per file descriptor.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\ *\ open\ files\f[].
.SS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
The VFS layer is used by rclone mount to make a cloud storage system
work more like a normal file system.
.PP
You'll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read and
write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-cache\-dir\ string\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Directory\ rclone\ will\ use\ for\ caching.
\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age\ duration\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Max\ age\ of\ objects\ in\ the\ cache.\ (default\ 1h0m0s)

\-\-vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval\ duration\ \ \ Interval\ to\ poll\ the\ cache\ for\ stale\ objects.\ (default\ 1m0s)
\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-size\ int\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Max\ total\ size\ of\ objects\ in\ the\ cache.\ (default\ off)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]\-vv\f[] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]\-\-cache\-dir\f[] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode\f[].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won't get
written back to the remote.
However they will still be in the on disk cache.
.PP
If using \[en]vfs\-cache\-max\-size note that the cache may exceed this
size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\[en]vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval.
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode off
.PP
In this mode the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can't be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can't be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
.IP \[bu] 2
Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can't be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[lq]off\[rq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disks.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.
.PP
These operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only can't be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can't be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried up to \[en]low\-level\-retries
times.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When a file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety
first.
.PP
This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the
cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.
.PP
In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk, it
will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote.
It will be purged on a schedule according to
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age\f[].
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload or download fails it will be retried up to
\[en]low\-level\-retries times.

\f[]
.fi
.PP
If the remote file already exists, it will be overwritten.
.PP
rcat will try to upload small files in a single request, which is
usually more efficient than the streaming/chunked upload endpoints,
which use multiple requests.
Exact behaviour depends on the remote.
What is considered a small file may be set through
\f[C]\-\-streaming\-upload\-cutoff\f[].
Uploading only starts after the cutoff is reached or if the file ends
before that.
The data must fit into RAM.
The cutoff needs to be small enough to adhere the limits of your remote,
please see there.
Generally speaking, setting this cutoff too high will decrease your
performance.
.PP
Note that the upload can also not be retried because the data is not
kept around until the upload succeeds.
If you need to transfer a lot of data, you're better off caching locally
and then \f[C]rclone\ move\f[] it to the destination.

Serve remote:path over DLNA
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve dlna is a DLNA media server for media stored in a rclone
remote.
Many devices, such as the Xbox and PlayStation, can automatically
discover this server in the LAN and play audio/video from it.
VLC is also supported.
Service discovery uses UDP multicast packets (SSDP) and will thus only
work on LANs.
.PP
Rclone will list all files present in the remote, without filtering
based on media formats or file extensions.
Additionally, there is no media transcoding support.
This means that some players might show files that they are not able to
play back correctly.
.SS Server options
.PP
Use \[en]addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg \[en]addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or \[en]addr :8080 to listen to all
IPs.
.PP
Use \[en]name to choose the friendly server name, which is by default
\[lq]rclone (hostname)\[rq].
.PP
Use \[en]log\-trace in conjunction with \-vv to enable additional debug
logging of all UPNP traffic.
.SS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]\-\-dir\-cache\-time\f[] flag, you can set how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate
the cache.
However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once the
cache expires.
.PP
Alternatively, you can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[] signal to rclone for it to
flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill\ \-SIGHUP\ $(pidof\ rclone)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control (/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ rc\ vfs/forget
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ rc\ vfs/forget\ file=path/to/file\ dir=path/to/dir
\f[]
.fi
.SS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\f[] flag determines the amount of memory, that
will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file descriptor will try to keep the specified amount of data
in memory at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one file descriptor and won't be shared
between multiple open file descriptors of the same file.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per file descriptor.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\ *\ open\ files\f[].
.SS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
The VFS layer is used by rclone mount to make a cloud storage system
work more like a normal file system.
.PP
You'll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read and
write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.

\f[]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]\-vv\f[] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]\-\-cache\-dir\f[] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode\f[].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won't get
written back to the remote.
However they will still be in the on disk cache.
.PP
If using \[en]vfs\-cache\-max\-size note that the cache may exceed this
size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\[en]vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval.
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode off
.PP
In this mode the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can't be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can't be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2

.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[lq]off\[rq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disks.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.

.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can't be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried up to \[en]low\-level\-retries
times.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When a file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety
first.
.PP
This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the
cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.
.PP
In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk, it
will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote.
It will be purged on a schedule according to
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age\f[].

.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve ftp implements a basic ftp server to serve the remote over
FTP protocol.
This can be viewed with a ftp client or you can make a remote of type
ftp to read and write it.
.SS Server options
.PP
Use \[en]addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg \[en]addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or \[en]addr :8080 to listen to all
IPs.
By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
.PP
If you set \[en]addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised \- see the next section for info.
.SS Authentication

You can set a single username and password with the \[en]user and
\[en]pass flags.

.SS Auth Proxy
.PP
If you supply the parameter \f[C]\-\-auth\-proxy\ /path/to/program\f[]
then rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which
then are used to authenticate incoming requests.
This uses a simple JSON based protocl with input on STDIN and output on
STDOUT.
.PP
There is an example program
bin/test_proxy.py (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.
.PP
The program's job is to take a \f[C]user\f[] and \f[C]pass\f[] on the
input and turn those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON
format.
This config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but
it won't use configuration from environment variables or command line
options \- it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete config.
.PP
This config generated must have this extra parameter \- \f[C]_root\f[]
\- root to use for the backend
.PP
And it may have this parameter \- \f[C]_obscure\f[] \- comma separated
strings for parameters to obscure
.PP
For example the program might take this on STDIN
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
\ \ \ \ "user":\ "me",
\ \ \ \ "pass":\ "mypassword"
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
And return this on STDOUT
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
\ \ \ \ "type":\ "sftp",
\ \ \ \ "_root":\ "",
\ \ \ \ "_obscure":\ "pass",
\ \ \ \ "user":\ "me",
\ \ \ \ "pass":\ "mypassword",
\ \ \ \ "host":\ "sftp.example.com"
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the
\f[C]user\f[] and \f[C]pass\f[] returned in the output to the host
given.
Note that since \f[C]_obscure\f[] is set to \f[C]pass\f[], rclone will
obscure the \f[C]pass\f[] parameter before creating the backend (which
is required for sftp backends).
.PP
The progam can manipulate the supplied \f[C]user\f[] in any way, for
example to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make
the \f[C]user\f[] be \f[C]user\@example.com\f[] and then set the
\f[C]host\f[] to \f[C]example.com\f[] in the output and the user to
\f[C]user\f[].
For security you'd probably want to restrict the \f[C]host\f[] to a
limited list.
.PP
Note that an internal cache is keyed on \f[C]user\f[] so only use that
for configuration, don't use \f[C]pass\f[].
This also means that if a user's password is changed the cache will need
to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it takes effect.
.PP
This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.

rclone serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/) \- Serve a
remote over a protocol.
.SS rclone serve http
.PP
Serve the remote over HTTP.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve http implements a basic web server to serve the remote over
HTTP.
This can be viewed in a web browser or you can make a remote of type
http read from it.
.PP
You can use the filter flags (eg \[en]include, \[en]exclude) to control
what is served.
.PP
The server will log errors.
Use \-v to see access logs.
.PP
\[en]bwlimit will be respected for file transfers.
Use \[en]stats to control the stats printing.
.SS Server options
.PP
Use \[en]addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg \[en]addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or \[en]addr :8080 to listen to all
IPs.
By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
.PP
If you set \[en]addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised \- see the next section for info.
.PP
\[en]server\-read\-timeout and \[en]server\-write\-timeout can be used
to control the timeouts on the server.
Note that this is the total time for a transfer.
.PP
\[en]max\-header\-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server
will accept in the HTTP header.
.PP
\[en]baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.
By default rclone will serve from the root.
If you used \[en]baseurl \[lq]/rclone\[rq] then rclone would serve from
a URL starting with \[lq]/rclone/\[rq].
This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.
Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing \[lq]/\[rq] on
\[en]baseurl, so \[en]baseurl \[lq]rclone\[rq], \[en]baseurl
\[lq]/rclone\[rq] and \[en]baseurl \[lq]/rclone/\[rq] are all treated
identically.
.SS Authentication
.PP
By default this will serve files without needing a login.
.PP
You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the \[en]user and \[en]pass flags.
.PP
Use \[en]htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file.
This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for
basic authentication.
Bcrypt is recommended.
.PP
To create an htpasswd file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
touch\ htpasswd
htpasswd\ \-B\ htpasswd\ user
htpasswd\ \-B\ htpasswd\ anotherUser
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The password file can be updated while rclone is running.
.PP
Use \[en]realm to set the authentication realm.
.SS SSL/TLS
.PP
By default this will serve over http.
If you want you can serve over https.
You will need to supply the \[en]cert and \[en]key flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need
to supply \[en]client\-ca also.
.PP
\[en]cert should be a either a PEM encoded certificate or a
concatenation of that with the CA certificate.
\[en]key should be the PEM encoded private key and \[en]client\-ca
should be the PEM encoded client certificate authority certificate.
.SS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]\-\-dir\-cache\-time\f[] flag, you can set how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate
the cache.
However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once the
cache expires.
.PP
Alternatively, you can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[] signal to rclone for it to
flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill\ \-SIGHUP\ $(pidof\ rclone)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control (/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ rc\ vfs/forget
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ rc\ vfs/forget\ file=path/to/file\ dir=path/to/dir
\f[]
.fi
.SS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\f[] flag determines the amount of memory, that
will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file descriptor will try to keep the specified amount of data
in memory at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one file descriptor and won't be shared
between multiple open file descriptors of the same file.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per file descriptor.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\ *\ open\ files\f[].
.SS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
The VFS layer is used by rclone mount to make a cloud storage system
work more like a normal file system.
.PP
You'll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read and
write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-cache\-dir\ string\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Directory\ rclone\ will\ use\ for\ caching.
\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age\ duration\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Max\ age\ of\ objects\ in\ the\ cache.\ (default\ 1h0m0s)
\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode\ string\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Cache\ mode\ off|minimal|writes|full\ (default\ "off")
\-\-vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval\ duration\ \ \ Interval\ to\ poll\ the\ cache\ for\ stale\ objects.\ (default\ 1m0s)
\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-size\ int\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Max\ total\ size\ of\ objects\ in\ the\ cache.\ (default\ off)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]\-vv\f[] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]\-\-cache\-dir\f[] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode\f[].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won't get
written back to the remote.
However they will still be in the on disk cache.
.PP
If using \[en]vfs\-cache\-max\-size note that the cache may exceed this
size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\[en]vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval.
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode off
.PP
In this mode the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can't be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can't be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
.IP \[bu] 2
Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can't be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[lq]off\[rq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disks.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.
.PP
These operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only can't be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can't be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried up to \[en]low\-level\-retries
times.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When a file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety
first.
.PP
This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the
cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.
.PP
In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk, it
will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote.
It will be purged on a schedule according to
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age\f[].
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload or download fails it will be retried up to
\[en]low\-level\-retries times.

rclone serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/) \- Serve a
remote over a protocol.
.SS rclone serve restic
.PP
Serve the remote for restic's REST API.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve restic implements restic's REST backend API over HTTP.
This allows restic to use rclone as a data storage mechanism for cloud
providers that restic does not support directly.
.PP
Restic (https://restic.net/) is a command line program for doing
backups.
.PP
The server will log errors.
Use \-v to see access logs.
.PP
\[en]bwlimit will be respected for file transfers.
Use \[en]stats to control the stats printing.
.SS Setting up rclone for use by restic
.PP
First set up a remote for your chosen cloud provider (/docs/#configure).
.PP
Once you have set up the remote, check it is working with, for example
\[lq]rclone lsd remote:\[rq].
You may have called the remote something other than \[lq]remote:\[rq] \-
just substitute whatever you called it in the following instructions.
.PP
Now start the rclone restic server
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ serve\ restic\ \-v\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Where you can replace \[lq]backup\[rq] in the above by whatever path in
the remote you wish to use.
.PP
By default this will serve on \[lq]localhost:8080\[rq] you can change
this with use of the \[lq]\[en]addr\[rq] flag.
.PP
You might wish to start this server on boot.
.SS Setting up restic to use rclone
.PP
Now you can follow the restic
instructions (http://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#rest-server)
on setting up restic.
.PP
Note that you will need restic 0.8.2 or later to interoperate with
rclone.
.PP
For the example above you will want to use
\[lq]http://localhost:8080/\[rq] as the URL for the REST server.
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ export\ RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/
$\ export\ RESTIC_PASSWORD=yourpassword
$\ restic\ init
created\ restic\ backend\ 8b1a4b56ae\ at\ rest:http://localhost:8080/

Please\ note\ that\ knowledge\ of\ your\ password\ is\ required\ to\ access

.SS Multiple repositories
.PP
Note that you can use the endpoint to host multiple repositories.
Do this by adding a directory name or path after the URL.
Note that these \f[B]must\f[] end with /.
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ export\ RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user1repo/

$\ export\ RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user2repo/
#\ backup\ user2\ stuff
\f[]
.fi
.SS Private repositories
.PP
The \[lq]\[en]private\-repos\[rq] flag can be used to limit users to
repositories starting with a path of \[lq]//\[rq].
.SS Server options
.PP
Use \[en]addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg \[en]addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or \[en]addr :8080 to listen to all

By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
.PP

By default rclone will serve from the root.
If you used \[en]baseurl \[lq]/rclone\[rq] then rclone would serve from
a URL starting with \[lq]/rclone/\[rq].
This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.

.PP
rclone serve sftp implements an SFTP server to serve the remote over
SFTP.
This can be used with an SFTP client or you can make a remote of type
sftp to use with it.

.PP
Note that this also implements a small number of shell commands so that
it can provide md5sum/sha1sum/df information for the rclone sftp
backend.
This means that is can support SHA1SUMs, MD5SUMs and the about command
when paired with the rclone sftp backend.
.PP
If you don't supply a \[en]key then rclone will generate one and cache
it for later use.
.PP
By default the server binds to localhost:2022 \- if you want it to be
reachable externally then supply \[lq]\[en]addr :2022\[rq] for example.
.PP
Note that the default of \[lq]\[en]vfs\-cache\-mode off\[rq] is fine for
the rclone sftp backend, but it may not be with other SFTP clients.
.SS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]\-\-dir\-cache\-time\f[] flag, you can set how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate
the cache.
However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once the
cache expires.
.PP
Alternatively, you can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[] signal to rclone for it to
flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill\ \-SIGHUP\ $(pidof\ rclone)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control (/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ rc\ vfs/forget
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ rc\ vfs/forget\ file=path/to/file\ dir=path/to/dir
\f[]
.fi
.SS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\f[] flag determines the amount of memory, that
will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file descriptor will try to keep the specified amount of data
in memory at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one file descriptor and won't be shared
between multiple open file descriptors of the same file.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per file descriptor.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\ *\ open\ files\f[].
.SS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
The VFS layer is used by rclone mount to make a cloud storage system
work more like a normal file system.
.PP
You'll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read and
write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP

\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-size\ int\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Max\ total\ size\ of\ objects\ in\ the\ cache.\ (default\ off)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]\-vv\f[] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]\-\-cache\-dir\f[] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode\f[].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won't get
written back to the remote.
However they will still be in the on disk cache.
.PP
If using \[en]vfs\-cache\-max\-size note that the cache may exceed this
size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\[en]vfs\-cache\-poll\-interval.
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode off
.PP
In this mode the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can't be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can't be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
.IP \[bu] 2
Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can't be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[lq]off\[rq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disks.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.
.PP
These operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only can't be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can't be retried
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried up to \[en]low\-level\-retries
times.
.SS \[en]vfs\-cache\-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When a file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety
first.
.PP
This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the
cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.
.PP
In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk, it
will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote.
It will be purged on a schedule according to
\f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-max\-age\f[].
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload or download fails it will be retried up to
\[en]low\-level\-retries times.
.SS Auth Proxy
.PP
If you supply the parameter \f[C]\-\-auth\-proxy\ /path/to/program\f[]
then rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which
then are used to authenticate incoming requests.
This uses a simple JSON based protocl with input on STDIN and output on
STDOUT.
.PP
There is an example program
bin/test_proxy.py (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.
.PP
The program's job is to take a \f[C]user\f[] and \f[C]pass\f[] on the
input and turn those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON
format.
This config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but
it won't use configuration from environment variables or command line
options \- it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete config.
.PP
This config generated must have this extra parameter \- \f[C]_root\f[]
\- root to use for the backend
.PP
And it may have this parameter \- \f[C]_obscure\f[] \- comma separated
strings for parameters to obscure
.PP
For example the program might take this on STDIN
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
\ \ \ \ "user":\ "me",
\ \ \ \ "pass":\ "mypassword"
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
And return this on STDOUT
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
\ \ \ \ "type":\ "sftp",
\ \ \ \ "_root":\ "",
\ \ \ \ "_obscure":\ "pass",
\ \ \ \ "user":\ "me",
\ \ \ \ "pass":\ "mypassword",
\ \ \ \ "host":\ "sftp.example.com"
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the
\f[C]user\f[] and \f[C]pass\f[] returned in the output to the host
given.
Note that since \f[C]_obscure\f[] is set to \f[C]pass\f[], rclone will
obscure the \f[C]pass\f[] parameter before creating the backend (which
is required for sftp backends).
.PP
The progam can manipulate the supplied \f[C]user\f[] in any way, for
example to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make
the \f[C]user\f[] be \f[C]user\@example.com\f[] and then set the
\f[C]host\f[] to \f[C]example.com\f[] in the output and the user to
\f[C]user\f[].
For security you'd probably want to restrict the \f[C]host\f[] to a
limited list.
.PP
Note that an internal cache is keyed on \f[C]user\f[] so only use that
for configuration, don't use \f[C]pass\f[].
This also means that if a user's password is changed the cache will need
to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it takes effect.
.PP
This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.

.SS SEE ALSO
.IP \[bu] 2
rclone serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/) \- Serve a
remote over a protocol.
.SS rclone serve webdav
.PP
Serve remote:path over webdav.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve webdav implements a basic webdav server to serve the remote
over HTTP via the webdav protocol.
This can be viewed with a webdav client, through a web browser, or you
can make a remote of type webdav to read and write it.
.SS Webdav options
.SS \[en]etag\-hash
.PP
This controls the ETag header.
Without this flag the ETag will be based on the ModTime and Size of the
object.
.PP
If this flag is set to \[lq]auto\[rq] then rclone will choose the first
supported hash on the backend or you can use a named hash such as
\[lq]MD5\[rq] or \[lq]SHA\-1\[rq].
.PP
Use \[lq]rclone hashsum\[rq] to see the full list.
.SS Server options
.PP
Use \[en]addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg \[en]addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or \[en]addr :8080 to listen to all
IPs.
By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
.PP
If you set \[en]addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised \- see the next section for info.
.PP
\[en]server\-read\-timeout and \[en]server\-write\-timeout can be used
to control the timeouts on the server.
Note that this is the total time for a transfer.
.PP
\[en]max\-header\-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server
will accept in the HTTP header.
.PP
\[en]baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.
By default rclone will serve from the root.
If you used \[en]baseurl \[lq]/rclone\[rq] then rclone would serve from
a URL starting with \[lq]/rclone/\[rq].
This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.
Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing \[lq]/\[rq] on
\[en]baseurl, so \[en]baseurl \[lq]rclone\[rq], \[en]baseurl
\[lq]/rclone\[rq] and \[en]baseurl \[lq]/rclone/\[rq] are all treated
identically.
.SS Authentication
.PP
By default this will serve files without needing a login.
.PP
You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the \[en]user and \[en]pass flags.
.PP
Use \[en]htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file.
This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for
basic authentication.
Bcrypt is recommended.
.PP
To create an htpasswd file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
touch\ htpasswd
htpasswd\ \-B\ htpasswd\ user
htpasswd\ \-B\ htpasswd\ anotherUser
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The password file can be updated while rclone is running.
.PP
Use \[en]realm to set the authentication realm.
.SS SSL/TLS
.PP
By default this will serve over http.
If you want you can serve over https.
You will need to supply the \[en]cert and \[en]key flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need
to supply \[en]client\-ca also.
.PP
\[en]cert should be a either a PEM encoded certificate or a
concatenation of that with the CA certificate.
\[en]key should be the PEM encoded private key and \[en]client\-ca
should be the PEM encoded client certificate authority certificate.
.SS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]\-\-dir\-cache\-time\f[] flag, you can set how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate
the cache.
However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once the
cache expires.
.PP

\f[C]host\f[] to \f[C]example.com\f[] in the output and the user to
\f[C]user\f[].
For security you'd probably want to restrict the \f[C]host\f[] to a
limited list.
.PP
Note that an internal cache is keyed on \f[C]user\f[] so only use that
for configuration, don't use \f[C]pass\f[].
This also means that if a user's password is changed the cache will need
to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it takes effect.
.PP
This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.

.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone settier changes storage tier or class at remote if supported.
Few cloud storage services provides different storage classes on
objects, for example AWS S3 and Glacier, Azure Blob storage \- Hot, Cool
and Archive, Google Cloud Storage, Regional Storage, Nearline, Coldline
etc.
.PP
Note that, certain tier changes make objects not available to access
immediately.
For example tiering to archive in azure blob storage makes objects in
frozen state, user can restore by setting tier to Hot/Cool, similarly S3
to Glacier makes object inaccessible.true

.SS Copying single files
.PP
rclone normally syncs or copies directories.
However, if the source remote points to a file, rclone will just copy
that file.
The destination remote must point to a directory \- rclone will give the
error
\f[C]Failed\ to\ create\ file\ system\ for\ "remote:file":\ is\ a\ file\ not\ a\ directory\f[]
if it isn't.
.PP
For example, suppose you have a remote with a file in called
\f[C]test.jpg\f[], then you could copy just that file like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ remote:test.jpg\ /tmp/download
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The file \f[C]test.jpg\f[] will be placed inside \f[C]/tmp/download\f[].
.PP
This is equivalent to specifying
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ \-\-files\-from\ /tmp/files\ remote:\ /tmp/download
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Where \f[C]/tmp/files\f[] contains the single line
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
test.jpg
\f[]
.fi
.PP
It is recommended to use \f[C]copy\f[] when copying individual files,
not \f[C]sync\f[].
They have pretty much the same effect but \f[C]copy\f[] will use a lot
less memory.
.SS Syntax of remote paths
.PP
The syntax of the paths passed to the rclone command are as follows.
.SS /path/to/dir
.PP
This refers to the local file system.
.PP
On Windows only \f[C]\\\f[] may be used instead of \f[C]/\f[] in local
paths \f[B]only\f[], non local paths must use \f[C]/\f[].
.PP
These paths needn't start with a leading \f[C]/\f[] \- if they don't
then they will be relative to the current directory.
.SS remote:path/to/dir
.PP
This refers to a directory \f[C]path/to/dir\f[] on \f[C]remote:\f[] as
defined in the config file (configured with \f[C]rclone\ config\f[]).
.SS remote:/path/to/dir
.PP
On most backends this is refers to the same directory as
\f[C]remote:path/to/dir\f[] and that format should be preferred.
On a very small number of remotes (FTP, SFTP, Dropbox for business) this
will refer to a different directory.
On these, paths without a leading \f[C]/\f[] will refer to your
\[lq]home\[rq] directory and paths with a leading \f[C]/\f[] will refer
to the root.
.SS :backend:path/to/dir
.PP
This is an advanced form for creating remotes on the fly.
\f[C]backend\f[] should be the name or prefix of a backend (the
\f[C]type\f[] in the config file) and all the configuration for the
backend should be provided on the command line (or in environment
variables).
.PP
Here are some examples:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ lsd\ \-\-http\-url\ https://pub.rclone.org\ :http:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To list all the directories in the root of
\f[C]https://pub.rclone.org/\f[].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ lsf\ \-\-http\-url\ https://example.com\ :http:path/to/dir
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To list files and directories in
\f[C]https://example.com/path/to/dir/\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ \-\-http\-url\ https://example.com\ :http:path/to/dir\ /tmp/dir
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To copy files and directories in
\f[C]https://example.com/path/to/dir\f[] to \f[C]/tmp/dir\f[].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ \-\-sftp\-host\ example.com\ :sftp:path/to/dir\ /tmp/dir
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To copy files and directories from \f[C]example.com\f[] in the relative
directory \f[C]path/to/dir\f[] to \f[C]/tmp/dir\f[] using sftp.
.SS Quoting and the shell
.PP
When you are typing commands to your computer you are using something
called the command line shell.
This interprets various characters in an OS specific way.
.PP
Here are some gotchas which may help users unfamiliar with the shell
rules
.SS Linux / OSX
.PP
If your names have spaces or shell metacharacters (eg \f[C]*\f[],
\f[C]?\f[], \f[C]$\f[], \f[C]\[aq]\f[], \f[C]"\f[] etc) then you must
quote them.
Use single quotes \f[C]\[aq]\f[] by default.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ \[aq]Important\ files?\[aq]\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you want to send a \f[C]\[aq]\f[] you will need to use \f[C]"\f[], eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ "O\[aq]Reilly\ Reviews"\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The rules for quoting metacharacters are complicated and if you want the
full details you'll have to consult the manual page for your shell.
.SS Windows
.PP
If your names have spaces in you need to put them in \f[C]"\f[], eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ "E:\\folder\ name\\folder\ name\\folder\ name"\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you are using the root directory on its own then don't quote it (see
#464 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/464) for why), eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ E:\\\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.SS Copying files or directories with \f[C]:\f[] in the names
.PP
rclone uses \f[C]:\f[] to mark a remote name.
This is, however, a valid filename component in non\-Windows OSes.
The remote name parser will only search for a \f[C]:\f[] up to the first
\f[C]/\f[] so if you need to act on a file or directory like this then
use the full path starting with a \f[C]/\f[], or use \f[C]\&./\f[] as a
current directory prefix.
.PP
So to sync a directory called \f[C]sync:me\f[] to a remote called
\f[C]remote:\f[] use
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ ./sync:me\ remote:path
\f[]
.fi
.PP
or
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ /full/path/to/sync:me\ remote:path
\f[]
.fi
.SS Server Side Copy
.PP
Most remotes (but not all \- see the
overview (/overview/#optional-features)) support server side copy.
.PP
This means if you want to copy one folder to another then rclone won't
download all the files and re\-upload them; it will instruct the server
to copy them in place.
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ s3:oldbucket\ s3:newbucket
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Will copy the contents of \f[C]oldbucket\f[] to \f[C]newbucket\f[]
without downloading and re\-uploading.
.PP
Remotes which don't support server side copy \f[B]will\f[] download and
re\-upload in this case.
.PP
Server side copies are used with \f[C]sync\f[] and \f[C]copy\f[] and
will be identified in the log when using the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag.
The \f[C]move\f[] command may also use them if remote doesn't support
server side move directly.
This is done by issuing a server side copy then a delete which is much
quicker than a download and re\-upload.
.PP
Server side copies will only be attempted if the remote names are the
same.
.PP
This can be used when scripting to make aged backups efficiently, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ remote:current\-backup\ remote:previous\-backup
rclone\ sync\ /path/to/files\ remote:current\-backup
\f[]
.fi
.SS Options
.PP
Rclone has a number of options to control its behaviour.
.PP
Options that take parameters can have the values passed in two ways,
\f[C]\-\-option=value\f[] or \f[C]\-\-option\ value\f[].
However boolean (true/false) options behave slightly differently to the
other options in that \f[C]\-\-boolean\f[] sets the option to
\f[C]true\f[] and the absence of the flag sets it to \f[C]false\f[].
It is also possible to specify \f[C]\-\-boolean=false\f[] or
\f[C]\-\-boolean=true\f[].
Note that \f[C]\-\-boolean\ false\f[] is not valid \- this is parsed as
\f[C]\-\-boolean\f[] and the \f[C]false\f[] is parsed as an extra
command line argument for rclone.
.PP
Options which use TIME use the go time parser.
A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each
with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as \[lq]300ms\[rq],
\[lq]\-1.5h\[rq] or \[lq]2h45m\[rq].
Valid time units are \[lq]ns\[rq], \[lq]us\[rq] (or \[lq]µs\[rq]),
\[lq]ms\[rq], \[lq]s\[rq], \[lq]m\[rq], \[lq]h\[rq].
.PP
Options which use SIZE use kByte by default.
However, a suffix of \f[C]b\f[] for bytes, \f[C]k\f[] for kBytes,
\f[C]M\f[] for MBytes, \f[C]G\f[] for GBytes, \f[C]T\f[] for TBytes and
\f[C]P\f[] for PBytes may be used.
These are the binary units, eg 1, 2**10, 2**20, 2**30 respectively.
.SS \[en]backup\-dir=DIR
.PP
When using \f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[] or \f[C]move\f[] any files which
would have been overwritten or deleted are moved in their original
hierarchy into this directory.
.PP
If \f[C]\-\-suffix\f[] is set, then the moved files will have the suffix
added to them.
If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has been added)
in DIR, then it will be overwritten.
.PP
The remote in use must support server side move or copy and you must use
the same remote as the destination of the sync.
The backup directory must not overlap the destination directory.
.PP
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ /path/to/local\ remote:current\ \-\-backup\-dir\ remote:old
\f[]
.fi
.PP
will sync \f[C]/path/to/local\f[] to \f[C]remote:current\f[], but for
any files which would have been updated or deleted will be stored in
\f[C]remote:old\f[].
.PP
If running rclone from a script you might want to use today's date as
the directory name passed to \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir\f[] to store the old
files, or you might want to pass \f[C]\-\-suffix\f[] with today's date.
.PP
See \f[C]\-\-compare\-dest\f[] and \f[C]\-\-copy\-dest\f[].
.SS \[en]bind string
.PP
Local address to bind to for outgoing connections.
This can be an IPv4 address (1.2.3.4), an IPv6 address (1234::789A) or
host name.
If the host name doesn't resolve or resolves to more than one IP address
it will give an error.
.SS \[en]bwlimit=BANDWIDTH_SPEC
.PP
This option controls the bandwidth limit.
Limits can be specified in two ways: As a single limit, or as a
timetable.
.PP
Single limits last for the duration of the session.
To use a single limit, specify the desired bandwidth in kBytes/s, or use
a suffix b|k|M|G.
The default is \f[C]0\f[] which means to not limit bandwidth.
.PP
For example, to limit bandwidth usage to 10 MBytes/s use
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit\ 10M\f[]
.PP
It is also possible to specify a \[lq]timetable\[rq] of limits, which
will cause certain limits to be applied at certain times.
To specify a timetable, format your entries as
\[lq]WEEKDAY\-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH WEEKDAY\-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH\&...\[rq] where:
WEEKDAY is optional element.
It could be written as whole world or only using 3 first characters.
HH:MM is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.
.PP
An example of a typical timetable to avoid link saturation during
daytime working hours could be:
.PP
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit\ "08:00,512\ 12:00,10M\ 13:00,512\ 18:00,30M\ 23:00,off"\f[]
.PP
In this example, the transfer bandwidth will be every day set to
512kBytes/sec at 8am.
At noon, it will raise to 10Mbytes/s, and drop back to 512kBytes/sec at
1pm.
At 6pm, the bandwidth limit will be set to 30MBytes/s, and at 11pm it
will be completely disabled (full speed).
Anything between 11pm and 8am will remain unlimited.
.PP
An example of timetable with WEEKDAY could be:
.PP
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit\ "Mon\-00:00,512\ Fri\-23:59,10M\ Sat\-10:00,1M\ Sun\-20:00,off"\f[]
.PP
It mean that, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512kBytes/sec on
Monday.
It will raise to 10Mbytes/s before the end of Friday.
At 10:00 on Sunday it will be set to 1Mbyte/s.
From 20:00 at Sunday will be unlimited.
.PP
Timeslots without weekday are extended to whole week.
So this one example:
.PP
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit\ "Mon\-00:00,512\ 12:00,1M\ Sun\-20:00,off"\f[]
.PP
Is equal to this:
.PP
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit\ "Mon\-00:00,512Mon\-12:00,1M\ Tue\-12:00,1M\ Wed\-12:00,1M\ Thu\-12:00,1M\ Fri\-12:00,1M\ Sat\-12:00,1M\ Sun\-12:00,1M\ Sun\-20:00,off"\f[]
.PP
Bandwidth limits only apply to the data transfer.
They don't apply to the bandwidth of the directory listings etc.
.PP
Note that the units are Bytes/s, not Bits/s.
Typically connections are measured in Bits/s \- to convert divide by 8.
For example, let's say you have a 10 Mbit/s connection and you wish
rclone to use half of it \- 5 Mbit/s.
This is 5/8 = 0.625MByte/s so you would use a
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit\ 0.625M\f[] parameter for rclone.
.PP
On Unix systems (Linux, MacOS, \&...) the bandwidth limiter can be
toggled by sending a \f[C]SIGUSR2\f[] signal to rclone.
This allows to remove the limitations of a long running rclone transfer
and to restore it back to the value specified with \f[C]\-\-bwlimit\f[]
quickly when needed.
Assuming there is only one rclone instance running, you can toggle the
limiter like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill\ \-SIGUSR2\ $(pidof\ rclone)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control (/rc) then you can use
change the bwlimit dynamically:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ rc\ core/bwlimit\ rate=1M
\f[]
.fi
.SS \[en]buffer\-size=SIZE
.PP
Use this sized buffer to speed up file transfers.
Each \f[C]\-\-transfer\f[] will use this much memory for buffering.
.PP
When using \f[C]mount\f[] or \f[C]cmount\f[] each open file descriptor
will use this much memory for buffering.
See the mount (/commands/rclone_mount/#file-buffering) documentation for
more details.
.PP
Set to 0 to disable the buffering for the minimum memory usage.
.PP
Note that the memory allocation of the buffers is influenced by the
\[en]use\-mmap flag.
.SS \[en]checkers=N
.PP
The number of checkers to run in parallel.
Checkers do the equality checking of files during a sync.
For some storage systems (eg S3, Swift, Dropbox) this can take a
significant amount of time so they are run in parallel.
.PP
The default is to run 8 checkers in parallel.
.SS \-c, \[en]checksum
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check the file hash and size to
determine if files are equal.
.PP
This is useful when the remote doesn't support setting modified time and
a more accurate sync is desired than just checking the file size.
.PP
This is very useful when transferring between remotes which store the
same hash type on the object, eg Drive and Swift.
For details of which remotes support which hash type see the table in
the overview section (https://rclone.org/overview/).
.PP
Eg \f[C]rclone\ \-\-checksum\ sync\ s3:/bucket\ swift:/bucket\f[] would
run much quicker than without the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.PP
When using this flag, rclone won't update mtimes of remote files if they
are incorrect as it would normally.
.SS \[en]compare\-dest=DIR
.PP
When using \f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[] or \f[C]move\f[] DIR is checked
in addition to the destination for files.
If a file identical to the source is found that file is NOT copied from
source.
This is useful to copy just files that have changed since the last
backup.
.PP
You must use the same remote as the destination of the sync.
The compare directory must not overlap the destination directory.
.PP
See \f[C]\-\-copy\-dest\f[] and \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir\f[].
.SS \[en]config=CONFIG_FILE
.PP
Specify the location of the rclone config file.
.PP
Normally the config file is in your home directory as a file called
\f[C]\&.config/rclone/rclone.conf\f[] (or \f[C]\&.rclone.conf\f[] if
created with an older version).
If \f[C]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\f[] is set it will be at
\f[C]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rclone/rclone.conf\f[].
.PP
If there is a file \f[C]rclone.conf\f[] in the same directory as the
rclone executable it will be preferred.
This file must be created manually for Rclone to use it, it will never
be created automatically.
.PP
If you run \f[C]rclone\ config\ file\f[] you will see where the default
location is for you.
.PP
Use this flag to override the config location, eg
\f[C]rclone\ \-\-config=".myconfig"\ .config\f[].
.SS \[en]contimeout=TIME
.PP
Set the connection timeout.
This should be in go time format which looks like \f[C]5s\f[] for 5
seconds, \f[C]10m\f[] for 10 minutes, or \f[C]3h30m\f[].
.PP
The connection timeout is the amount of time rclone will wait for a
connection to go through to a remote object storage system.
It is \f[C]1m\f[] by default.
.SS \[en]copy\-dest=DIR
.PP
When using \f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[] or \f[C]move\f[] DIR is checked
in addition to the destination for files.
If a file identical to the source is found that file is server side
copied from DIR to the destination.
This is useful for incremental backup.
.PP
The remote in use must support server side copy and you must use the
same remote as the destination of the sync.
The compare directory must not overlap the destination directory.
.PP
See \f[C]\-\-compare\-dest\f[] and \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir\f[].
.SS \[en]dedupe\-mode MODE
.PP
Mode to run dedupe command in.
One of \f[C]interactive\f[], \f[C]skip\f[], \f[C]first\f[],
\f[C]newest\f[], \f[C]oldest\f[], \f[C]rename\f[].
The default is \f[C]interactive\f[].
See the dedupe command for more information as to what these options
mean.
.SS \[en]disable FEATURE,FEATURE,\&...
.PP
This disables a comma separated list of optional features.
For example to disable server side move and server side copy use:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-disable\ move,copy
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The features can be put in in any case.
.PP
To see a list of which features can be disabled use:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-disable\ help
\f[]
.fi
.PP
See the overview features (/overview/#features) and optional
features (/overview/#optional-features) to get an idea of which feature
does what.
.PP
This flag can be useful for debugging and in exceptional circumstances
(eg Google Drive limiting the total volume of Server Side Copies to
100GB/day).
.SS \-n, \[en]dry\-run
.PP
Do a trial run with no permanent changes.
Use this to see what rclone would do without actually doing it.
Useful when setting up the \f[C]sync\f[] command which deletes files in
the destination.
.SS \[en]ignore\-case\-sync
.PP
Using this option will cause rclone to ignore the case of the files when
synchronizing so files will not be copied/synced when the existing
filenames are the same, even if the casing is different.
.SS \[en]ignore\-checksum
.PP
Normally rclone will check that the checksums of transferred files
match, and give an error \[lq]corrupted on transfer\[rq] if they don't.
.PP
You can use this option to skip that check.
You should only use it if you have had the \[lq]corrupted on
transfer\[rq] error message and you are sure you might want to transfer
potentially corrupted data.
.SS \[en]ignore\-existing
.PP
Using this option will make rclone unconditionally skip all files that
exist on the destination, no matter the content of these files.
.PP
While this isn't a generally recommended option, it can be useful in
cases where your files change due to encryption.
However, it cannot correct partial transfers in case a transfer was
interrupted.
.SS \[en]ignore\-size
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check only the modification time.
If \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] is set then it only checks the checksum.
.PP
It will also cause rclone to skip verifying the sizes are the same after
transfer.
.PP
This can be useful for transferring files to and from OneDrive which
occasionally misreports the size of image files (see
#399 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/399) for more info).
.SS \-I, \[en]ignore\-times
.PP
Using this option will cause rclone to unconditionally upload all files
regardless of the state of files on the destination.
.PP
Normally rclone would skip any files that have the same modification
time and are the same size (or have the same checksum if using
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[]).
.SS \[en]immutable
.PP
Treat source and destination files as immutable and disallow
modification.
.PP
With this option set, files will be created and deleted as requested,
but existing files will never be updated.
If an existing file does not match between the source and destination,
rclone will give the error
\f[C]Source\ and\ destination\ exist\ but\ do\ not\ match:\ immutable\ file\ modified\f[].
.PP
Note that only commands which transfer files (e.g.
\f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[], \f[C]move\f[]) are affected by this
behavior, and only modification is disallowed.
Files may still be deleted explicitly (e.g.
\f[C]delete\f[], \f[C]purge\f[]) or implicitly (e.g.
\f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]move\f[]).
Use \f[C]copy\ \-\-immutable\f[] if it is desired to avoid deletion as
well as modification.
.PP
This can be useful as an additional layer of protection for immutable or
append\-only data sets (notably backup archives), where modification
implies corruption and should not be propagated.
.SS \[en]leave\-root
.PP
During rmdirs it will not remove root directory, even if it's empty.
.SS \[en]log\-file=FILE
.PP
Log all of rclone's output to FILE.
This is not active by default.
This can be useful for tracking down problems with syncs in combination
with the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag.
See the Logging section for more info.
.PP
Note that if you are using the \f[C]logrotate\f[] program to manage
rclone's logs, then you should use the \f[C]copytruncate\f[] option as
rclone doesn't have a signal to rotate logs.
.SS \[en]log\-format LIST
.PP
Comma separated list of log format options.
\f[C]date\f[], \f[C]time\f[], \f[C]microseconds\f[], \f[C]longfile\f[],
\f[C]shortfile\f[], \f[C]UTC\f[].
The default is \[lq]\f[C]date\f[],\f[C]time\f[]\[rq].
.SS \[en]log\-level LEVEL
.PP
This sets the log level for rclone.
The default log level is \f[C]NOTICE\f[].
.PP
\f[C]DEBUG\f[] is equivalent to \f[C]\-vv\f[].
It outputs lots of debug info \- useful for bug reports and really
finding out what rclone is doing.
.PP
\f[C]INFO\f[] is equivalent to \f[C]\-v\f[].
It outputs information about each transfer and prints stats once a
minute by default.
.PP
\f[C]NOTICE\f[] is the default log level if no logging flags are
supplied.
It outputs very little when things are working normally.
It outputs warnings and significant events.
.PP
\f[C]ERROR\f[] is equivalent to \f[C]\-q\f[].
It only outputs error messages.
.SS \[en]use\-json\-log
.PP
This switches the log format to JSON for rclone.
The fields of json log are level, msg, source, time.
.SS \[en]low\-level\-retries NUMBER
.PP
This controls the number of low level retries rclone does.
.PP
A low level retry is used to retry a failing operation \- typically one
HTTP request.
This might be uploading a chunk of a big file for example.
You will see low level retries in the log with the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag.
.PP
This shouldn't need to be changed from the default in normal operations.
However, if you get a lot of low level retries you may wish to reduce
the value so rclone moves on to a high level retry (see the
\f[C]\-\-retries\f[] flag) quicker.
.PP
Disable low level retries with \f[C]\-\-low\-level\-retries\ 1\f[].
.SS \[en]max\-backlog=N
.PP
This is the maximum allowable backlog of files in a sync/copy/move
queued for being checked or transferred.
.PP
This can be set arbitrarily large.
It will only use memory when the queue is in use.
Note that it will use in the order of N kB of memory when the backlog is
in use.
.PP
Setting this large allows rclone to calculate how many files are pending
more accurately and give a more accurate estimated finish time.
.PP
Setting this small will make rclone more synchronous to the listings of
the remote which may be desirable.
.SS \[en]max\-delete=N
.PP
This tells rclone not to delete more than N files.
If that limit is exceeded then a fatal error will be generated and
rclone will stop the operation in progress.
.SS \[en]max\-depth=N
.PP
This modifies the recursion depth for all the commands except purge.
.PP
So if you do \f[C]rclone\ \-\-max\-depth\ 1\ ls\ remote:path\f[] you
will see only the files in the top level directory.
Using \f[C]\-\-max\-depth\ 2\f[] means you will see all the files in
first two directory levels and so on.
.PP
For historical reasons the \f[C]lsd\f[] command defaults to using a
\f[C]\-\-max\-depth\f[] of 1 \- you can override this with the command
line flag.
.PP
You can use this command to disable recursion (with
\f[C]\-\-max\-depth\ 1\f[]).
.PP
Note that if you use this with \f[C]sync\f[] and
\f[C]\-\-delete\-excluded\f[] the files not recursed through are
considered excluded and will be deleted on the destination.
Test first with \f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] if you are not sure what will
happen.
.SS \[en]max\-transfer=SIZE
.PP
Rclone will stop transferring when it has reached the size specified.
Defaults to off.
.PP
When the limit is reached all transfers will stop immediately.
.PP
Rclone will exit with exit code 8 if the transfer limit is reached.
.SS \[en]modify\-window=TIME
.PP
When checking whether a file has been modified, this is the maximum
allowed time difference that a file can have and still be considered
equivalent.
.PP
The default is \f[C]1ns\f[] unless this is overridden by a remote.
For example OS X only stores modification times to the nearest second so
if you are reading and writing to an OS X filing system this will be
\f[C]1s\f[] by default.
.PP
This command line flag allows you to override that computed default.
.SS \[en]multi\-thread\-cutoff=SIZE
.PP
When downloading files to the local backend above this size, rclone will
use multiple threads to download the file.
(default 250M)
.PP
Rclone preallocates the file (using
\f[C]fallocate(FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE)\f[] on unix or
\f[C]NTSetInformationFile\f[] on Windows both of which takes no time)
then each thread writes directly into the file at the correct place.
This means that rclone won't create fragmented or sparse files and there
won't be any assembly time at the end of the transfer.
.PP
The number of threads used to dowload is controlled by
\f[C]\-\-multi\-thread\-streams\f[].
.PP
Use \f[C]\-vv\f[] if you wish to see info about the threads.
.PP
This will work with the \f[C]sync\f[]/\f[C]copy\f[]/\f[C]move\f[]
commands and friends \f[C]copyto\f[]/\f[C]moveto\f[].
Multi thread downloads will be used with \f[C]rclone\ mount\f[] and
\f[C]rclone\ serve\f[] if \f[C]\-\-vfs\-cache\-mode\f[] is set to
\f[C]writes\f[] or above.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[] that this \f[B]only\f[] works for a local destination but
will work with any source.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[] that multi thread copies are disabled for local to local
copies as they are faster without unless
\f[C]\-\-multi\-thread\-streams\f[] is set explicitly.
.SS \[en]multi\-thread\-streams=N
.PP
When using multi thread downloads (see above
\f[C]\-\-multi\-thread\-cutoff\f[]) this sets the maximum number of
streams to use.
Set to \f[C]0\f[] to disable multi thread downloads.
(Default 4)
.PP
Exactly how many streams rclone uses for the download depends on the
size of the file.
To calculate the number of download streams Rclone divides the size of
the file by the \f[C]\-\-multi\-thread\-cutoff\f[] and rounds up, up to
the maximum set with \f[C]\-\-multi\-thread\-streams\f[].
.PP
So if \f[C]\-\-multi\-thread\-cutoff\ 250MB\f[] and
\f[C]\-\-multi\-thread\-streams\ 4\f[] are in effect (the defaults):
.IP \[bu] 2
0MB.250MB files will be downloaded with 1 stream
.IP \[bu] 2
250MB..500MB files will be downloaded with 2 streams
.IP \[bu] 2
500MB..750MB files will be downloaded with 3 streams
.IP \[bu] 2
750MB+ files will be downloaded with 4 streams
.SS \[en]no\-gzip\-encoding
.PP
Don't set \f[C]Accept\-Encoding:\ gzip\f[].
This means that rclone won't ask the server for compressed files
automatically.
Useful if you've set the server to return files with
\f[C]Content\-Encoding:\ gzip\f[] but you uploaded compressed files.
.PP
There is no need to set this in normal operation, and doing so will
decrease the network transfer efficiency of rclone.
.SS \[en]no\-traverse
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[] flag controls whether the destination file
system is traversed when using the \f[C]copy\f[] or \f[C]move\f[]
commands.
\f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[] is not compatible with \f[C]sync\f[] and will
be ignored if you supply it with \f[C]sync\f[].
.PP
If you are only copying a small number of files (or are filtering most
of the files) and/or have a large number of files on the destination
then \f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[] will stop rclone listing the destination
and save time.
.PP
However, if you are copying a large number of files, especially if you
are doing a copy where lots of the files under consideration haven't
changed and won't need copying then you shouldn't use
\f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[].
.PP
See rclone copy (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) for an
example of how to use it.
.SS \[en]no\-update\-modtime
.PP
When using this flag, rclone won't update modification times of remote
files if they are incorrect as it would normally.
.PP
This can be used if the remote is being synced with another tool also
(eg the Google Drive client).
.SS \-P, \[en]progress
.PP
This flag makes rclone update the stats in a static block in the
terminal providing a realtime overview of the transfer.
.PP
Any log messages will scroll above the static block.
Log messages will push the static block down to the bottom of the
terminal where it will stay.
.PP
Normally this is updated every 500mS but this period can be overridden
with the \f[C]\-\-stats\f[] flag.
.PP
This can be used with the \f[C]\-\-stats\-one\-line\f[] flag for a
simpler display.
.PP
Note: On Windows untilthis
bug (https://github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm/issues/26) is fixed all
non\-ASCII characters will be replaced with \f[C]\&.\f[] when
\f[C]\-\-progress\f[] is in use.
.SS \-q, \[en]quiet
.PP
Normally rclone outputs stats and a completion message.
If you set this flag it will make as little output as possible.
.SS \[en]retries int
.PP
Retry the entire sync if it fails this many times it fails (default 3).
.PP
Some remotes can be unreliable and a few retries help pick up the files
which didn't get transferred because of errors.
.PP
Disable retries with \f[C]\-\-retries\ 1\f[].
.SS \[en]retries\-sleep=TIME
.PP
This sets the interval between each retry specified by
\f[C]\-\-retries\f[]
.PP
The default is 0.
Use 0 to disable.
.SS \[en]size\-only
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check only the size.
.PP
This can be useful transferring files from Dropbox which have been
modified by the desktop sync client which doesn't set checksums of
modification times in the same way as rclone.
.SS \[en]stats=TIME
.PP
Commands which transfer data (\f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[],
\f[C]copyto\f[], \f[C]move\f[], \f[C]moveto\f[]) will print data
transfer stats at regular intervals to show their progress.
.PP
This sets the interval.
.PP
The default is \f[C]1m\f[].
Use 0 to disable.
.PP
If you set the stats interval then all commands can show stats.
This can be useful when running other commands, \f[C]check\f[] or
\f[C]mount\f[] for example.
.PP
Stats are logged at \f[C]INFO\f[] level by default which means they
won't show at default log level \f[C]NOTICE\f[].
Use \f[C]\-\-stats\-log\-level\ NOTICE\f[] or \f[C]\-v\f[] to make them
show.
See the Logging section for more info on log levels.
.PP
Note that on macOS you can send a SIGINFO (which is normally ctrl\-T in
the terminal) to make the stats print immediately.
.SS \[en]stats\-file\-name\-length integer
.PP
By default, the \f[C]\-\-stats\f[] output will truncate file names and
paths longer than 40 characters.
This is equivalent to providing
\f[C]\-\-stats\-file\-name\-length\ 40\f[].
Use \f[C]\-\-stats\-file\-name\-length\ 0\f[] to disable any truncation
of file names printed by stats.
.SS \[en]stats\-log\-level string
.PP
Log level to show \f[C]\-\-stats\f[] output at.
This can be \f[C]DEBUG\f[], \f[C]INFO\f[], \f[C]NOTICE\f[], or
\f[C]ERROR\f[].
The default is \f[C]INFO\f[].
This means at the default level of logging which is \f[C]NOTICE\f[] the
stats won't show \- if you want them to then use
\f[C]\-\-stats\-log\-level\ NOTICE\f[].
See the Logging section for more info on log levels.
.SS \[en]stats\-one\-line
.PP
When this is specified, rclone condenses the stats into a single line
showing the most important stats only.
.SS \[en]stats\-one\-line\-date
.PP
When this is specified, rclone enables the single\-line stats and
prepends the display with a date string.
The default is \f[C]2006/01/02\ 15:04:05\ \-\f[]
.SS \[en]stats\-one\-line\-date\-format
.PP
When this is specified, rclone enables the single\-line stats and
prepends the display with a user\-supplied date string.
The date string MUST be enclosed in quotes.
Follow golang specs (https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Format) for date
formatting syntax.
.SS \[en]stats\-unit=bits|bytes
.PP
By default, data transfer rates will be printed in bytes/second.
.PP
This option allows the data rate to be printed in bits/second.
.PP
Data transfer volume will still be reported in bytes.
.PP
The rate is reported as a binary unit, not SI unit.
So 1 Mbit/s equals 1,048,576 bits/s and not 1,000,000 bits/s.
.PP
The default is \f[C]bytes\f[].
.SS \[en]suffix=SUFFIX
.PP
When using \f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[] or \f[C]move\f[] any files which
would have been overwritten or deleted will have the suffix added to
them.
If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has been added),
then it will be overwritten.
.PP
The remote in use must support server side move or copy and you must use
the same remote as the destination of the sync.
.PP
This is for use with files to add the suffix in the current directory or
with \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir\f[].
See \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir\f[] for more info.
.PP
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ /path/to/local/file\ remote:current\ \-\-suffix\ .bak
\f[]
.fi
.PP
will sync \f[C]/path/to/local\f[] to \f[C]remote:current\f[], but for
any files which would have been updated or deleted have .bak added.
.SS \[en]suffix\-keep\-extension
.PP
When using \f[C]\-\-suffix\f[], setting this causes rclone put the
SUFFIX before the extension of the files that it backs up rather than
after.
.PP
So let's say we had \f[C]\-\-suffix\ \-2019\-01\-01\f[], without the
flag \f[C]file.txt\f[] would be backed up to
\f[C]file.txt\-2019\-01\-01\f[] and with the flag it would be backed up
to \f[C]file\-2019\-01\-01.txt\f[].
This can be helpful to make sure the suffixed files can still be opened.
.SS \[en]syslog
.PP
On capable OSes (not Windows or Plan9) send all log output to syslog.
.PP
This can be useful for running rclone in a script or
\f[C]rclone\ mount\f[].
.SS \[en]syslog\-facility string
.PP
If using \f[C]\-\-syslog\f[] this sets the syslog facility (eg
\f[C]KERN\f[], \f[C]USER\f[]).
See \f[C]man\ syslog\f[] for a list of possible facilities.
The default facility is \f[C]DAEMON\f[].
.SS \[en]tpslimit float
.PP
Limit HTTP transactions per second to this.
Default is 0 which is used to mean unlimited transactions per second.
.PP
For example to limit rclone to 10 HTTP transactions per second use
\f[C]\-\-tpslimit\ 10\f[], or to 1 transaction every 2 seconds use
\f[C]\-\-tpslimit\ 0.5\f[].
.PP
Use this when the number of transactions per second from rclone is
causing a problem with the cloud storage provider (eg getting you banned
or rate limited).
.PP
This can be very useful for \f[C]rclone\ mount\f[] to control the
behaviour of applications using it.
.PP
See also \f[C]\-\-tpslimit\-burst\f[].
.SS \[en]tpslimit\-burst int
.PP
Max burst of transactions for \f[C]\-\-tpslimit\f[].
(default 1)
.PP
Normally \f[C]\-\-tpslimit\f[] will do exactly the number of transaction
per second specified.
However if you supply \f[C]\-\-tps\-burst\f[] then rclone can save up
some transactions from when it was idle giving a burst of up to the
parameter supplied.
.PP
For example if you provide \f[C]\-\-tpslimit\-burst\ 10\f[] then if
rclone has been idle for more than 10*\f[C]\-\-tpslimit\f[] then it can
do 10 transactions very quickly before they are limited again.
.PP
This may be used to increase performance of \f[C]\-\-tpslimit\f[]
without changing the long term average number of transactions per
second.
.SS \[en]track\-renames
.PP
By default, rclone doesn't keep track of renamed files, so if you rename
a file locally then sync it to a remote, rclone will delete the old file
on the remote and upload a new copy.
.PP
If you use this flag, and the remote supports server side copy or server
side move, and the source and destination have a compatible hash, then
this will track renames during \f[C]sync\f[] operations and perform
renaming server\-side.
.PP
Files will be matched by size and hash \- if both match then a rename
will be considered.
.PP
If the destination does not support server\-side copy or move, rclone
will fall back to the default behaviour and log an error level message
to the console.
Note: Encrypted destinations are not supported by
\f[C]\-\-track\-renames\f[].
.PP
Note that \f[C]\-\-track\-renames\f[] is incompatible with
\f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[] and that it uses extra memory to keep track of
all the rename candidates.
.PP
Note also that \f[C]\-\-track\-renames\f[] is incompatible with
\f[C]\-\-delete\-before\f[] and will select \f[C]\-\-delete\-after\f[]
instead of \f[C]\-\-delete\-during\f[].
.SS \[en]delete\-(before,during,after)
.PP
This option allows you to specify when files on your destination are
deleted when you sync folders.
.PP
Specifying the value \f[C]\-\-delete\-before\f[] will delete all files
present on the destination, but not on the source \f[I]before\f[]
starting the transfer of any new or updated files.
This uses two passes through the file systems, one for the deletions and
one for the copies.
.PP
Specifying \f[C]\-\-delete\-during\f[] will delete files while checking
and uploading files.
This is the fastest option and uses the least memory.
.PP
Specifying \f[C]\-\-delete\-after\f[] (the default value) will delay
deletion of files until all new/updated files have been successfully
transferred.
The files to be deleted are collected in the copy pass then deleted
after the copy pass has completed successfully.
The files to be deleted are held in memory so this mode may use more
memory.
This is the safest mode as it will only delete files if there have been
no errors subsequent to that.
If there have been errors before the deletions start then you will get
the message \f[C]not\ deleting\ files\ as\ there\ were\ IO\ errors\f[].
.SS \[en]fast\-list
.PP
When doing anything which involves a directory listing (eg
\f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[], \f[C]ls\f[] \- in fact nearly every
command), rclone normally lists a directory and processes it before
using more directory lists to process any subdirectories.
This can be parallelised and works very quickly using the least amount
of memory.
.PP
However, some remotes have a way of listing all files beneath a
directory in one (or a small number) of transactions.
These tend to be the bucket based remotes (eg S3, B2, GCS, Swift,
Hubic).
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] flag then rclone will use this
method for listing directories.
This will have the following consequences for the listing:
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[B]will\f[] use fewer transactions (important if you pay for them)
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[B]will\f[] use more memory.
Rclone has to load the whole listing into memory.
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[I]may\f[] be faster because it uses fewer transactions
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[I]may\f[] be slower because it can't be parallelized
.PP
rclone should always give identical results with and without
\f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[].
.PP
If you pay for transactions and can fit your entire sync listing into
memory then \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] is recommended.
If you have a very big sync to do then don't use \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[]
otherwise you will run out of memory.
.PP
If you use \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] on a remote which doesn't support it,
then rclone will just ignore it.
.SS \[en]timeout=TIME
.PP
This sets the IO idle timeout.
If a transfer has started but then becomes idle for this long it is
considered broken and disconnected.
.PP
The default is \f[C]5m\f[].
Set to 0 to disable.
.SS \[en]transfers=N
.PP
The number of file transfers to run in parallel.
It can sometimes be useful to set this to a smaller number if the remote
is giving a lot of timeouts or bigger if you have lots of bandwidth and
a fast remote.
.PP
The default is to run 4 file transfers in parallel.
.SS \-u, \[en]update
.PP
This forces rclone to skip any files which exist on the destination and
have a modified time that is newer than the source file.
.PP
This can be useful when transferring to a remote which doesn't support
mod times directly (or when using \f[C]\-\-use\-server\-modtime\f[] to
avoid extra API calls) as it is more accurate than a
\f[C]\-\-size\-only\f[] check and faster than using
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[].
.PP
If an existing destination file has a modification time equal (within
the computed modify window precision) to the source file's, it will be
updated if the sizes are different.
If \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] is set then rclone will update the destination
if the checksums differ too.
.PP
If an existing destination file is older than the source file then it
will be updated if the size or checksum differs from the source file.
.PP
On remotes which don't support mod time directly (or when using
\f[C]\-\-use\-server\-modtime\f[]) the time checked will be the uploaded
time.
This means that if uploading to one of these remotes, rclone will skip
any files which exist on the destination and have an uploaded time that
is newer than the modification time of the source file.
.SS \[en]use\-mmap
.PP
If this flag is set then rclone will use anonymous memory allocated by
mmap on Unix based platforms and VirtualAlloc on Windows for its
transfer buffers (size controlled by \f[C]\-\-buffer\-size\f[]).
Memory allocated like this does not go on the Go heap and can be
returned to the OS immediately when it is finished with.
.PP
If this flag is not set then rclone will allocate and free the buffers
using the Go memory allocator which may use more memory as memory pages
are returned less aggressively to the OS.
.PP
It is possible this does not work well on all platforms so it is
disabled by default; in the future it may be enabled by default.
.SS \[en]use\-server\-modtime
.PP
Some object\-store backends (e.g, Swift, S3) do not preserve file
modification times (modtime).
On these backends, rclone stores the original modtime as additional
metadata on the object.
By default it will make an API call to retrieve the metadata when the
modtime is needed by an operation.
.PP
Use this flag to disable the extra API call and rely instead on the
server's modified time.
In cases such as a local to remote sync using \f[C]\-\-update\f[],
knowing the local file is newer than the time it was last uploaded to
the remote is sufficient.
In those cases, this flag can speed up the process and reduce the number
of API calls necessary.
.PP
Using this flag on a sync operation without also using
\f[C]\-\-update\f[] would cause all files modified at any time other
than the last upload time to be uploaded again, which is probably not
what you want.
.SS \-v, \-vv, \[en]verbose
.PP
With \f[C]\-v\f[] rclone will tell you about each file that is
transferred and a small number of significant events.
.PP
With \f[C]\-vv\f[] rclone will become very verbose telling you about
every file it considers and transfers.
Please send bug reports with a log with this setting.
.SS \-V, \[en]version
.PP
Prints the version number
.SS SSL/TLS options
.PP
The outoing SSL/TLS connections rclone makes can be controlled with
these options.
For example this can be very useful with the HTTP or WebDAV backends.
Rclone HTTP servers have their own set of configuration for SSL/TLS
which you can find in their documentation.
.SS \[en]ca\-cert string
.PP
This loads the PEM encoded certificate authority certificate and uses it
to verify the certificates of the servers rclone connects to.
.PP
If you have generated certificates signed with a local CA then you will
need this flag to connect to servers using those certificates.
.SS \[en]client\-cert string
.PP
This loads the PEM encoded client side certificate.
.PP
This is used for mutual TLS
authentication (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication).
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-client\-key\f[] flag is required too when using this.
.SS \[en]client\-key string
.PP
This loads the PEM encoded client side private key used for mutual TLS
authentication.
Used in conjunction with \f[C]\-\-client\-cert\f[].
.SS \[en]no\-check\-certificate=true/false
.PP
\f[C]\-\-no\-check\-certificate\f[] controls whether a client verifies
the server's certificate chain and host name.
If \f[C]\-\-no\-check\-certificate\f[] is true, TLS accepts any
certificate presented by the server and any host name in that
certificate.
In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man\-in\-the\-middle attacks.
.PP
This option defaults to \f[C]false\f[].
.PP
\f[B]This should be used only for testing.\f[]
.SS Configuration Encryption
.PP
Your configuration file contains information for logging in to your
cloud services.
This means that you should keep your \f[C]\&.rclone.conf\f[] file in a
secure location.
.PP
If you are in an environment where that isn't possible, you can add a
password to your configuration.
This means that you will have to enter the password every time you start
rclone.
.PP
To add a password to your rclone configuration, execute
\f[C]rclone\ config\f[].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
>rclone\ config
Current\ remotes:

e)\ Edit\ existing\ remote
n)\ New\ remote
d)\ Delete\ remote
s)\ Set\ configuration\ password
q)\ Quit\ config
e/n/d/s/q>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Go into \f[C]s\f[], Set configuration password:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
e/n/d/s/q>\ s
Your\ configuration\ is\ not\ encrypted.
If\ you\ add\ a\ password,\ you\ will\ protect\ your\ login\ information\ to\ cloud\ services.
a)\ Add\ Password
q)\ Quit\ to\ main\ menu
a/q>\ a
Enter\ NEW\ configuration\ password:

password:
Password\ set
Your\ configuration\ is\ encrypted.
c)\ Change\ Password
u)\ Unencrypt\ configuration
q)\ Quit\ to\ main\ menu
c/u/q>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Your configuration is now encrypted, and every time you start rclone you
will now be asked for the password.
In the same menu, you can change the password or completely remove
encryption from your configuration.
.PP
There is no way to recover the configuration if you lose your password.
.PP
rclone uses nacl
secretbox (https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox) which
in turn uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate your
configuration with secret\-key cryptography.
The password is SHA\-256 hashed, which produces the key for secretbox.
The hashed password is not stored.
.PP
While this provides very good security, we do not recommend storing your
encrypted rclone configuration in public if it contains sensitive
information, maybe except if you use a very strong password.
.PP
If it is safe in your environment, you can set the
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[] environment variable to contain your
password, in which case it will be used for decrypting the
configuration.
.PP
You can set this for a session from a script.
For unix like systems save this to a file called
\f[C]set\-rclone\-password\f[]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#!/bin/echo\ Source\ this\ file\ don\[aq]t\ run\ it

read\ \-s\ RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
export\ RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then source the file when you want to use it.
From the shell you would do \f[C]source\ set\-rclone\-password\f[].
It will then ask you for the password and set it in the environment
variable.
.PP
If you are running rclone inside a script, you might want to disable
password prompts.
To do that, pass the parameter \f[C]\-\-ask\-password=false\f[] to
rclone.
This will make rclone fail instead of asking for a password if
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[] doesn't contain a valid password.
.SS Developer options
.PP
These options are useful when developing or debugging rclone.
There are also some more remote specific options which aren't documented
here which are used for testing.
These start with remote name eg \f[C]\-\-drive\-test\-option\f[] \- see
the docs for the remote in question.
.SS \[en]cpuprofile=FILE
.PP
Write CPU profile to file.
This can be analysed with \f[C]go\ tool\ pprof\f[].
.SS \[en]dump flag,flag,flag
.PP
The \f[C]\-\-dump\f[] flag takes a comma separated list of flags to dump
info about.
These are:
.SS \[en]dump headers
.PP
Dump HTTP headers with \f[C]Authorization:\f[] lines removed.
May still contain sensitive info.
Can be very verbose.
Useful for debugging only.
.PP
Use \f[C]\-\-dump\ auth\f[] if you do want the \f[C]Authorization:\f[]
headers.
.SS \[en]dump bodies
.PP
Dump HTTP headers and bodies \- may contain sensitive info.
Can be very verbose.
Useful for debugging only.
.PP
Note that the bodies are buffered in memory so don't use this for
enormous files.
.SS \[en]dump requests
.PP
Like \f[C]\-\-dump\ bodies\f[] but dumps the request bodies and the
response headers.
Useful for debugging download problems.
.SS \[en]dump responses
.PP
Like \f[C]\-\-dump\ bodies\f[] but dumps the response bodies and the
request headers.
Useful for debugging upload problems.
.SS \[en]dump auth
.PP
Dump HTTP headers \- will contain sensitive info such as
\f[C]Authorization:\f[] headers \- use \f[C]\-\-dump\ headers\f[] to
dump without \f[C]Authorization:\f[] headers.
Can be very verbose.
Useful for debugging only.
.SS \[en]dump filters
.PP
Dump the filters to the output.
Useful to see exactly what include and exclude options are filtering on.
.SS \[en]dump goroutines
.PP
This dumps a list of the running go\-routines at the end of the command
to standard output.
.SS \[en]dump openfiles
.PP
This dumps a list of the open files at the end of the command.
It uses the \f[C]lsof\f[] command to do that so you'll need that
installed to use it.
.SS \[en]memprofile=FILE
.PP
Write memory profile to file.
This can be analysed with \f[C]go\ tool\ pprof\f[].

.SS Logging
.PP
rclone has 4 levels of logging, \f[C]ERROR\f[], \f[C]NOTICE\f[],
\f[C]INFO\f[] and \f[C]DEBUG\f[].
.PP
By default, rclone logs to standard error.
This means you can redirect standard error and still see the normal
output of rclone commands (eg \f[C]rclone\ ls\f[]).
.PP
By default, rclone will produce \f[C]Error\f[] and \f[C]Notice\f[] level
messages.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-q\f[] flag, rclone will only produce
\f[C]Error\f[] messages.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag, rclone will produce \f[C]Error\f[],
\f[C]Notice\f[] and \f[C]Info\f[] messages.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-vv\f[] flag, rclone will produce \f[C]Error\f[],
\f[C]Notice\f[], \f[C]Info\f[] and \f[C]Debug\f[] messages.
.PP
You can also control the log levels with the \f[C]\-\-log\-level\f[]
flag.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-\-log\-file=FILE\f[] option, rclone will redirect
\f[C]Error\f[], \f[C]Info\f[] and \f[C]Debug\f[] messages along with
standard error to FILE.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]\-\-syslog\f[] flag then rclone will log to syslog
and the \f[C]\-\-syslog\-facility\f[] control which facility it uses.
.PP
Rclone prefixes all log messages with their level in capitals, eg INFO
which makes it easy to grep the log file for different kinds of
information.
.SS Exit Code
.PP
If any errors occur during the command execution, rclone will exit with
a non\-zero exit code.
This allows scripts to detect when rclone operations have failed.
.PP
During the startup phase, rclone will exit immediately if an error is
detected in the configuration.
There will always be a log message immediately before exiting.
.PP
When rclone is running it will accumulate errors as it goes along, and
only exit with a non\-zero exit code if (after retries) there were still
failed transfers.
For every error counted there will be a high priority log message
(visible with \f[C]\-q\f[]) showing the message and which file caused
the problem.
A high priority message is also shown when starting a retry so the user
can see that any previous error messages may not be valid after the
retry.
If rclone has done a retry it will log a high priority message if the
retry was successful.
.SS List of exit codes
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]0\f[] \- success

.SS Environment Variables
.PP
Rclone can be configured entirely using environment variables.
These can be used to set defaults for options or config file entries.
.SS Options
.PP
Every option in rclone can have its default set by environment variable.
.PP
To find the name of the environment variable, first, take the long
option name, strip the leading \f[C]\-\-\f[], change \f[C]\-\f[] to
\f[C]_\f[], make upper case and prepend \f[C]RCLONE_\f[].
.PP
For example, to always set \f[C]\-\-stats\ 5s\f[], set the environment
variable \f[C]RCLONE_STATS=5s\f[].
If you set stats on the command line this will override the environment
variable setting.
.PP
Or to always use the trash in drive \f[C]\-\-drive\-use\-trash\f[], set
\f[C]RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH=true\f[].
.PP
The same parser is used for the options and the environment variables so
they take exactly the same form.
.SS Config file
.PP
You can set defaults for values in the config file on an individual
remote basis.
If you want to use this feature, you will need to discover the name of
the config items that you want.
The easiest way is to run through \f[C]rclone\ config\f[] by hand, then
look in the config file to see what the values are (the config file can
be found by looking at the help for \f[C]\-\-config\f[] in
\f[C]rclone\ help\f[]).
.PP
To find the name of the environment variable, you need to set, take
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_\f[] + name of remote + \f[C]_\f[] + name of config
file option and make it all uppercase.
.PP
For example, to configure an S3 remote named \f[C]mys3:\f[] without a
config file (using unix ways of setting environment variables):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ export\ RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_TYPE=s3
$\ export\ RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
$\ export\ RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
$\ rclone\ lsd\ MYS3:
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-1\ 2016\-09\-21\ 12:54:21\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-1\ my\-bucket
$\ rclone\ listremotes\ |\ grep\ mys3
mys3:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that if you want to create a remote using environment variables you
must create the \f[C]\&..._TYPE\f[] variable as above.
.SS Other environment variables
.IP \[bu] 2
RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS` set to contain your config file password (see
Configuration Encryption section)
.IP \[bu] 2
HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY (or the lowercase versions
thereof).
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
HTTPS_PROXY takes precedence over HTTP_PROXY for https requests.
.IP \[bu] 2
The environment values may be either a complete URL or a
\[lq]host[:port]\[rq] for, in which case the \[lq]http\[rq] scheme is
assumed.
.RE
.SH Configuring rclone on a remote / headless machine

If you are trying to set rclone up on a remote or headless box with no

Now transfer it to the remote box (scp, cut paste, ftp, sftp etc) and
place it in the correct place (use \f[C]rclone\ config\ file\f[] on the
remote box to find out where).
.SH Filtering, includes and excludes
.PP
Rclone has a sophisticated set of include and exclude rules.
Some of these are based on patterns and some on other things like file
size.
.PP
The filters are applied for the \f[C]copy\f[], \f[C]sync\f[],
\f[C]move\f[], \f[C]ls\f[], \f[C]lsl\f[], \f[C]md5sum\f[],
\f[C]sha1sum\f[], \f[C]size\f[], \f[C]delete\f[] and \f[C]check\f[]
operations.
Note that \f[C]purge\f[] does not obey the filters.
.PP
Each path as it passes through rclone is matched against the include and
exclude rules like \f[C]\-\-include\f[], \f[C]\-\-exclude\f[],
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[], \f[C]\-\-exclude\-from\f[],
\f[C]\-\-filter\f[], or \f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[].
The simplest way to try them out is using the \f[C]ls\f[] command, or
\f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] together with \f[C]\-v\f[].
.SS Patterns
.PP
The patterns used to match files for inclusion or exclusion are based on
\[lq]file globs\[rq] as used by the unix shell.
.PP
If the pattern starts with a \f[C]/\f[] then it only matches at the top
level of the directory tree, \f[B]relative to the root of the remote\f[]
(not necessarily the root of the local drive).
If it doesn't start with \f[C]/\f[] then it is matched starting at the
\f[B]end of the path\f[], but it will only match a complete path
element:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
file.jpg\ \ \-\ matches\ "file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "directory/file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "afile.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "directory/afile.jpg"
/file.jpg\ \-\ matches\ "file.jpg"\ in\ the\ root\ directory\ of\ the\ remote
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "afile.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "directory/file.jpg"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[] Note that you must use \f[C]/\f[] in patterns and not
\f[C]\\\f[] even if running on Windows.
.PP
A \f[C]*\f[] matches anything but not a \f[C]/\f[].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*.jpg\ \ \-\ matches\ "file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "directory/file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "file.jpg/something"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Use \f[C]**\f[] to match anything, including slashes (\f[C]/\f[]).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
dir/**\ \-\ matches\ "dir/file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "dir/dir1/dir2/file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "directory/file.jpg"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "adir/file.jpg"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
A \f[C]?\f[] matches any character except a slash \f[C]/\f[].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
l?ss\ \ \-\ matches\ "less"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "lass"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "floss"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
A \f[C][\f[] and \f[C]]\f[] together make a character class, such as
\f[C][a\-z]\f[] or \f[C][aeiou]\f[] or \f[C][[:alpha:]]\f[].
See the go regexp docs (https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/) for more
info on these.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
h[ae]llo\ \-\ matches\ "hello"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "hallo"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "hullo"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
A \f[C]{\f[] and \f[C]}\f[] define a choice between elements.
It should contain a comma separated list of patterns, any of which might
match.
These patterns can contain wildcards.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{one,two}_potato\ \-\ matches\ "one_potato"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "two_potato"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "three_potato"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "_potato"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Special characters can be escaped with a \f[C]\\\f[] before them.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\\*.jpg\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "*.jpg"
\\\\.jpg\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "\\.jpg"
\\[one\\].jpg\ \ \-\ matches\ "[one].jpg"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Patterns are case sensitive unless the \f[C]\-\-ignore\-case\f[] flag is
used.
.PP
Without \f[C]\-\-ignore\-case\f[] (default)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
potato\ \-\ matches\ "potato"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ doesn\[aq]t\ match\ "POTATO"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
With \f[C]\-\-ignore\-case\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
potato\ \-\ matches\ "potato"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ matches\ "POTATO"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note also that rclone filter globs can only be used in one of the filter
command line flags, not in the specification of the remote, so
\f[C]rclone\ copy\ "remote:dir*.jpg"\ /path/to/dir\f[] won't work \-
what is required is
\f[C]rclone\ \-\-include\ "*.jpg"\ copy\ remote:dir\ /path/to/dir\f[]
.SS Directories
.PP
Rclone keeps track of directories that could match any file patterns.
.PP
Eg if you add the include rule
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/a/*.jpg
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Rclone will synthesize the directory include rule
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/a/
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you put any rules which end in \f[C]/\f[] then it will only match
directories.
.PP
Directory matches are \f[B]only\f[] used to optimise directory access
patterns \- you must still match the files that you want to match.
Directory matches won't optimise anything on bucket based remotes (eg
s3, swift, google compute storage, b2) which don't have a concept of
directory.
.SS Differences between rsync and rclone patterns
.PP
Rclone implements bash style \f[C]{a,b,c}\f[] glob matching which rsync
doesn't.
.PP
Rclone always does a wildcard match so \f[C]\\\f[] must always escape a
\f[C]\\\f[].
.SS How the rules are used
.PP
Rclone maintains a combined list of include rules and exclude rules.
.PP
Each file is matched in order, starting from the top, against the rule
in the list until it finds a match.
The file is then included or excluded according to the rule type.
.PP
If the matcher fails to find a match after testing against all the
entries in the list then the path is included.
.PP
For example given the following rules, \f[C]+\f[] being include,
\f[C]\-\f[] being exclude,
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\ secret*.jpg
+\ *.jpg
+\ *.png
+\ file2.avi
\-\ *
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This would include
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]file1.jpg\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]file3.png\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]file2.avi\f[]
.PP
This would exclude
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]secret17.jpg\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
non \f[C]*.jpg\f[] and \f[C]*.png\f[]
.PP
A similar process is done on directory entries before recursing into
them.
This only works on remotes which have a concept of directory (Eg local,
google drive, onedrive, amazon drive) and not on bucket based remotes
(eg s3, swift, google compute storage, b2).
.SS Adding filtering rules
.PP
Filtering rules are added with the following command line flags.
.SS Repeating options
.PP
You can repeat the following options to add more than one rule of that
type.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-exclude\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-exclude\-from\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-filter\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[]
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[] You should not use \f[C]\-\-include*\f[] together
with \f[C]\-\-exclude*\f[].
It may produce different results than you expected.
In that case try to use: \f[C]\-\-filter*\f[].
.PP
Note that all the options of the same type are processed together in the
order above, regardless of what order they were placed on the command
line.
.PP
So all \f[C]\-\-include\f[] options are processed first in the order
they appeared on the command line, then all \f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[]
options etc.
.PP
To mix up the order includes and excludes, the \f[C]\-\-filter\f[] flag
can be used.
.SS \f[C]\-\-exclude\f[] \- Exclude files matching pattern
.PP
Add a single exclude rule with \f[C]\-\-exclude\f[].
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Eg \f[C]\-\-exclude\ *.bak\f[] to exclude all bak files from the sync.
.SS \f[C]\-\-exclude\-from\f[] \- Read exclude patterns from file
.PP
Add exclude rules from a file.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Prepare a file like this \f[C]exclude\-file.txt\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ a\ sample\ exclude\ rule\ file
*.bak
file2.jpg
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then use as \f[C]\-\-exclude\-from\ exclude\-file.txt\f[].
This will sync all files except those ending in \f[C]bak\f[] and
\f[C]file2.jpg\f[].
.PP
This is useful if you have a lot of rules.
.SS \f[C]\-\-include\f[] \- Include files matching pattern
.PP
Add a single include rule with \f[C]\-\-include\f[].
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Eg \f[C]\-\-include\ *.{png,jpg}\f[] to include all \f[C]png\f[] and
\f[C]jpg\f[] files in the backup and no others.
.PP
This adds an implicit \f[C]\-\-exclude\ *\f[] at the very end of the
filter list.
This means you can mix \f[C]\-\-include\f[] and
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[] with the other filters (eg
\f[C]\-\-exclude\f[]) but you must include all the files you want in the
include statement.
If this doesn't provide enough flexibility then you must use
\f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[].
.SS \f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[] \- Read include patterns from file
.PP
Add include rules from a file.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Prepare a file like this \f[C]include\-file.txt\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ a\ sample\ include\ rule\ file
*.jpg
*.png
file2.avi
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then use as \f[C]\-\-include\-from\ include\-file.txt\f[].
This will sync all \f[C]jpg\f[], \f[C]png\f[] files and
\f[C]file2.avi\f[].
.PP
This is useful if you have a lot of rules.
.PP
This adds an implicit \f[C]\-\-exclude\ *\f[] at the very end of the
filter list.
This means you can mix \f[C]\-\-include\f[] and
\f[C]\-\-include\-from\f[] with the other filters (eg
\f[C]\-\-exclude\f[]) but you must include all the files you want in the
include statement.
If this doesn't provide enough flexibility then you must use
\f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[].
.SS \f[C]\-\-filter\f[] \- Add a file\-filtering rule
.PP
This can be used to add a single include or exclude rule.
Include rules start with \f[C]+\f[] and exclude rules start with
\f[C]\-\f[].
A special rule called \f[C]!\f[] can be used to clear the existing
rules.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Eg \f[C]\-\-filter\ "\-\ *.bak"\f[] to exclude all bak files from the
sync.
.SS \f[C]\-\-filter\-from\f[] \- Read filtering patterns from a file
.PP
Add include/exclude rules from a file.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order the flags are processed in.
.PP
Prepare a file like this \f[C]filter\-file.txt\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ a\ sample\ filter\ rule\ file
\-\ secret*.jpg
+\ *.jpg
+\ *.png
+\ file2.avi
\-\ /dir/Trash/**
+\ /dir/**
#\ exclude\ everything\ else
\-\ *
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then use as \f[C]\-\-filter\-from\ filter\-file.txt\f[].
The rules are processed in the order that they are defined.
.PP
This example will include all \f[C]jpg\f[] and \f[C]png\f[] files,
exclude any files matching \f[C]secret*.jpg\f[] and include
\f[C]file2.avi\f[].
It will also include everything in the directory \f[C]dir\f[] at the
root of the sync, except \f[C]dir/Trash\f[] which it will exclude.
Everything else will be excluded from the sync.
.SS \f[C]\-\-files\-from\f[] \- Read list of source\-file names
.PP
This reads a list of file names from the file passed in and
\f[B]only\f[] these files are transferred.
The \f[B]filtering rules are ignored\f[] completely if you use this
option.
.PP
Rclone will traverse the file system if you use
\f[C]\-\-files\-from\f[], effectively using the files in
\f[C]\-\-files\-from\f[] as a set of filters.
Rclone will not error if any of the files are missing.
.PP
If you use \f[C]\-\-no\-traverse\f[] as well as \f[C]\-\-files\-from\f[]
then rclone will not traverse the destination file system, it will find
each file individually using approximately 1 API call.
This can be more efficient for small lists of files.
.PP
This option can be repeated to read from more than one file.
These are read in the order that they are placed on the command line.
.PP
Paths within the \f[C]\-\-files\-from\f[] file will be interpreted as
starting with the root specified in the command.
Leading \f[C]/\f[] characters are ignored.
.PP
For example, suppose you had \f[C]files\-from.txt\f[] with this content:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ comment
file1.jpg
subdir/file2.jpg
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You could then use it like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ \-\-files\-from\ files\-from.txt\ /home/me/pics\ remote:pics
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This will transfer these files only (if they exist)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/me/pics/file1.jpg\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ →\ remote:pics/file1.jpg
/home/me/pics/subdir/file2.jpg\ →\ remote:pics/subdir/file2.jpg
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To take a more complicated example, let's say you had a few files you
want to back up regularly with these absolute paths:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/important
/home/user1/dir/file
/home/user2/stuff
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To copy these you'd find a common subdirectory \- in this case
\f[C]/home\f[] and put the remaining files in \f[C]files\-from.txt\f[]
with or without leading \f[C]/\f[], eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
user1/important
user1/dir/file
user2/stuff
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You could then copy these to a remote like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ \-\-files\-from\ files\-from.txt\ /home\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The 3 files will arrive in \f[C]remote:backup\f[] with the paths as in
the \f[C]files\-from.txt\f[] like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/important\ →\ remote:backup/user1/important
/home/user1/dir/file\ \ →\ remote:backup/user1/dir/file
/home/user2/stuff\ \ \ \ \ →\ remote:backup/user2/stuff
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You could of course choose \f[C]/\f[] as the root too in which case your
\f[C]files\-from.txt\f[] might look like this.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/important
/home/user1/dir/file
/home/user2/stuff
\f[]
.fi
.PP
And you would transfer it like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ \-\-files\-from\ files\-from.txt\ /\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
In this case there will be an extra \f[C]home\f[] directory on the
remote:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/important\ →\ remote:backup/home/user1/important
/home/user1/dir/file\ \ →\ remote:backup/home/user1/dir/file
/home/user2/stuff\ \ \ \ \ →\ remote:backup/home/user2/stuff
\f[]
.fi
.SS \f[C]\-\-min\-size\f[] \- Don't transfer any file smaller than this
.PP
This option controls the minimum size file which will be transferred.
This defaults to \f[C]kBytes\f[] but a suffix of \f[C]k\f[], \f[C]M\f[],
or \f[C]G\f[] can be used.
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-min\-size\ 50k\f[] means no files smaller than
50kByte will be transferred.
.SS \f[C]\-\-max\-size\f[] \- Don't transfer any file larger than this
.PP
This option controls the maximum size file which will be transferred.
This defaults to \f[C]kBytes\f[] but a suffix of \f[C]k\f[], \f[C]M\f[],
or \f[C]G\f[] can be used.
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-max\-size\ 1G\f[] means no files larger than 1GByte
will be transferred.
.SS \f[C]\-\-max\-age\f[] \- Don't transfer any file older than this
.PP
This option controls the maximum age of files to transfer.
Give in seconds or with a suffix of:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]ms\f[] \- Milliseconds
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]s\f[] \- Seconds
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]m\f[] \- Minutes
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]h\f[] \- Hours
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]d\f[] \- Days
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]w\f[] \- Weeks
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]M\f[] \- Months
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]y\f[] \- Years
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-max\-age\ 2d\f[] means no files older than 2 days
will be transferred.
.SS \f[C]\-\-min\-age\f[] \- Don't transfer any file younger than this
.PP
This option controls the minimum age of files to transfer.
Give in seconds or with a suffix (see \f[C]\-\-max\-age\f[] for list of
suffixes)
.PP
For example \f[C]\-\-min\-age\ 2d\f[] means no files younger than 2 days
will be transferred.
.SS \f[C]\-\-delete\-excluded\f[] \- Delete files on dest excluded from
sync
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[] this flag is dangerous \- use with
\f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] and \f[C]\-v\f[] first.
.PP
When doing \f[C]rclone\ sync\f[] this will delete any files which are
excluded from the sync on the destination.
.PP
If for example you did a sync from \f[C]A\f[] to \f[C]B\f[] without the
\f[C]\-\-min\-size\ 50k\f[] flag
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ A:\ B:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then you repeated it like this with the \f[C]\-\-delete\-excluded\f[]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ \-\-min\-size\ 50k\ \-\-delete\-excluded\ sync\ A:\ B:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This would delete all files on \f[C]B\f[] which are less than 50 kBytes
as these are now excluded from the sync.
.PP
Always test first with \f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] and \f[C]\-v\f[] before
using this flag.
.SS \f[C]\-\-dump\ filters\f[] \- dump the filters to the output
.PP
This dumps the defined filters to the output as regular expressions.
.PP
Useful for debugging.
.SS \f[C]\-\-ignore\-case\f[] \- make searches case insensitive
.PP
Normally filter patterns are case sensitive.
If this flag is supplied then filter patterns become case insensitive.
.PP
Normally a \f[C]\-\-include\ "file.txt"\f[] will not match a file called
\f[C]FILE.txt\f[].
However if you use the \f[C]\-\-ignore\-case\f[] flag then
\f[C]\-\-include\ "file.txt"\f[] this will match a file called
\f[C]FILE.txt\f[].
.SS Quoting shell metacharacters
.PP
The examples above may not work verbatim in your shell as they have
shell metacharacters in them (eg \f[C]*\f[]), and may require quoting.
.PP
Eg linux, OSX
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include\ \\*.jpg\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include\ \[aq]*.jpg\[aq]\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include=\[aq]*.jpg\[aq]\f[]
.PP
In Windows the expansion is done by the command not the shell so this
should work fine
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-include\ *.jpg\f[]
.SS Exclude directory based on a file
.PP
It is possible to exclude a directory based on a file, which is present
in this directory.
Filename should be specified using the \f[C]\-\-exclude\-if\-present\f[]
flag.
This flag has a priority over the other filtering flags.
.PP
Imagine, you have the following directory structure:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
dir1/file1
dir1/dir2/file2
dir1/dir2/dir3/file3
dir1/dir2/dir3/.ignore
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You can exclude \f[C]dir3\f[] from sync by running the following
command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ \-\-exclude\-if\-present\ .ignore\ dir1\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Currently only one filename is supported, i.e.
\f[C]\-\-exclude\-if\-present\f[] should not be used multiple times.
.SH GUI (Experimental)
.PP
Rclone can serve a web based GUI (graphical user interface).
This is somewhat experimental at the moment so things may be subject to
change.
.PP
Run this command in a terminal and rclone will download and then display
the GUI in a web browser.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ rcd\ \-\-rc\-web\-gui
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This will produce logs like this and rclone needs to continue to run to
serve the GUI:

Rclone starts but only runs the remote control API (\[lq]rc\[rq]).
.IP \[bu] 2
The API is bound to localhost with an auto generated username and
password.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the API bundle is missing then rclone will download it.
.IP \[bu] 2
rclone will start serving the files from the API bundle over the same
port as the API
.IP \[bu] 2
rclone will open the browser with a \f[C]login_token\f[] so it can log
straight in.
.SS Advanced use
.PP
The \f[C]rclone\ rcd\f[] may use any of the flags documented on the rc
page (https://rclone.org/rc/#supported-parameters).
.PP
The flag \f[C]\-\-rc\-web\-gui\f[] is shorthand for
.IP \[bu] 2
Download the web GUI if necessary
.IP \[bu] 2
Check we are using some authentication
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-user\ gui\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-pass\ <random\ password>\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-serve\f[]
.PP
These flags can be overidden as desired.
.PP
See also the rclone rcd
documentation (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rcd/).
.SS Example: Running a public GUI
.PP
For example the GUI could be served on a public port over SSL using an
htpasswd file using the following flags:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-web\-gui\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-addr\ :443\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-htpasswd\ /path/to/htpasswd\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-cert\ /path/to/ssl.crt\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-key\ /path/to/ssl.key\f[]
.SS Example: Running a GUI behind a proxy
.PP
If you want to run the GUI behind a proxy at \f[C]/rclone\f[] you could
use these flags:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-web\-gui\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-baseurl\ rclone\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-htpasswd\ /path/to/htpasswd\f[]
.PP
Or instead of htpassword if you just want a single user and password:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-user\ me\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-rc\-pass\ mypassword\f[]
.SS Project
.PP
The GUI is being developed in the: rclone/rclone\-webui\-react
respository (https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react).

Bug reports and contributions very welcome welcome :\-)
.PP
If you have questions then please ask them on the rclone
forum (https://forum.rclone.org/).
.SH Remote controlling rclone
.PP
If rclone is run with the \f[C]\-\-rc\f[] flag then it starts an http
server which can be used to remote control rclone.
.PP
If you just want to run a remote control then see the rcd
command (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rcd/).
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[] this is experimental and everything here is subject to
change!
.SS Supported parameters

.SS \[en]rc\-server\-write\-timeout=DURATION
.PP
Timeout for server writing data (default 1h0m0s)
.SS \[en]rc\-serve
.PP
Enable the serving of remote objects via the HTTP interface.
This means objects will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5572/ by
default, so you can browse to http://127.0.0.1:5572/ or
http://127.0.0.1:5572/* to see a listing of the remotes.
Objects may be requested from remotes using this syntax
http://127.0.0.1:5572/[remote:path]/path/to/object
.PP
Default Off.
.SS \[en]rc\-files /path/to/directory
.PP
Path to local files to serve on the HTTP server.
.PP
If this is set then rclone will serve the files in that directory.
It will also open the root in the web browser if specified.
This is for implementing browser based GUIs for rclone functions.
.PP
If \f[C]\-\-rc\-user\f[] or \f[C]\-\-rc\-pass\f[] is set then the URL
that is opened will have the authorization in the URL in the
\f[C]http://user:pass\@localhost/\f[] style.
.PP
Default Off.
.SS \[en]rc\-web\-gui
.PP
Set this flag to serve the default web gui on the same port as rclone.
.PP
Default Off.
.SS \[en]rc\-allow\-origin
.PP
Set the allowed Access\-Control\-Allow\-Origin for rc requests.
.PP
Can be used with \[en]rc\-web\-gui if the rclone is running on different
IP than the web\-gui.
.PP
Default is IP address on which rc is running.
.SS \[en]rc\-web\-fetch\-url
.PP
Set the URL to fetch the rclone\-web\-gui files from.
.PP
Default
https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone\-webui\-react/releases/latest.

.SS \[en]rc\-job\-expire\-interval=DURATION
.PP
Interval duration to check for expired async jobs (default 10s).
.SS \[en]rc\-no\-auth
.PP
By default rclone will require authorisation to have been set up on the
rc interface in order to use any methods which access any rclone
remotes.
Eg \f[C]operations/list\f[] is denied as it involved creating a remote
as is \f[C]sync/copy\f[].
.PP
If this is set then no authorisation will be required on the server to
use these methods.
The alternative is to use \f[C]\-\-rc\-user\f[] and
\f[C]\-\-rc\-pass\f[] and use these credentials in the request.
.PP
Default Off.
.SS Accessing the remote control via the rclone rc command
.PP
Rclone itself implements the remote control protocol in its
\f[C]rclone\ rc\f[] command.
.PP
You can use it like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ rc\ rc/noop\ param1=one\ param2=two
{
\ \ \ \ "param1":\ "one",
\ \ \ \ "param2":\ "two"
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Run \f[C]rclone\ rc\f[] on its own to see the help for the installed
remote control commands.
.PP
\f[C]rclone\ rc\f[] also supports a \f[C]\-\-json\f[] flag which can be
used to send more complicated input parameters.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ rc\ \-\-json\ \[aq]{\ "p1":\ [1,"2",null,4],\ "p2":\ {\ "a":1,\ "b":2\ }\ }\[aq]\ rc/noop
{
\ \ \ \ "p1":\ [
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "2",
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ null,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 4
\ \ \ \ ],
\ \ \ \ "p2":\ {
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "a":\ 1,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "b":\ 2
\ \ \ \ }
}
\f[]
.fi
.SS Special parameters
.PP
The rc interface supports some special parameters which apply to
\f[B]all\f[] commands.
These start with \f[C]_\f[] to show they are different.
.SS Running asynchronous jobs with _async = true
.PP
Each rc call is classified as a job and it is assigned its own id.
By default jobs are executed immediately as they are created or
synchronously.
.PP
If \f[C]_async\f[] has a true value when supplied to an rc call then it
will return immediately with a job id and the task will be run in the
background.
The \f[C]job/status\f[] call can be used to get information of the
background job.
The job can be queried for up to 1 minute after it has finished.
.PP
It is recommended that potentially long running jobs, eg
\f[C]sync/sync\f[], \f[C]sync/copy\f[], \f[C]sync/move\f[],
\f[C]operations/purge\f[] are run with the \f[C]_async\f[] flag to avoid
any potential problems with the HTTP request and response timing out.
.PP
Starting a job with the \f[C]_async\f[] flag:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ rc\ \-\-json\ \[aq]{\ "p1":\ [1,"2",null,4],\ "p2":\ {\ "a":1,\ "b":2\ },\ "_async":\ true\ }\[aq]\ rc/noop
{
\ \ \ \ "jobid":\ 2
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Query the status to see if the job has finished.
For more information on the meaning of these return parameters see the
\f[C]job/status\f[] call.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ rc\ \-\-json\ \[aq]{\ "jobid":2\ }\[aq]\ job/status
{
\ \ \ \ "duration":\ 0.000124163,
\ \ \ \ "endTime":\ "2018\-10\-27T11:38:07.911245881+01:00",
\ \ \ \ "error":\ "",
\ \ \ \ "finished":\ true,
\ \ \ \ "id":\ 2,
\ \ \ \ "output":\ {
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "_async":\ true,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "p1":\ [
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "2",
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ null,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 4
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ],
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "p2":\ {
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "a":\ 1,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "b":\ 2
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }
\ \ \ \ },
\ \ \ \ "startTime":\ "2018\-10\-27T11:38:07.911121728+01:00",
\ \ \ \ "success":\ true
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\f[C]job/list\f[] can be used to show the running or recently completed
jobs
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ rc\ job/list
{
\ \ \ \ "jobids":\ [
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 2
\ \ \ \ ]
}
\f[]
.fi
.SS Assigning operations to groups with _group =
.PP
Each rc call has it's own stats group for tracking it's metrics.
By default grouping is done by the composite group name from prefix
\f[C]job/\f[] and id of the job like so \f[C]job/1\f[].
.PP
If \f[C]_group\f[] has a value then stats for that request will be
grouped under that value.
This allows caller to group stats under their own name.
.PP
Stats for specific group can be accessed by passing \f[C]group\f[] to
\f[C]core/stats\f[]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ rc\ \-\-json\ \[aq]{\ "group":\ "job/1"\ }\[aq]\ core/stats
{
\ \ \ \ "speed":\ 12345
\ \ \ \ ...
}
\f[]
.fi
.SS Supported commands
.SS cache/expire: Purge a remote from cache {#cache/expire}
.PP
Purge a remote from the cache backend.
Supports either a directory or a file.
Params: \- remote = path to remote (required) \- withData = true/false
to delete cached data (chunks) as well (optional)
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ rc\ cache/expire\ remote=path/to/sub/folder/
rclone\ rc\ cache/expire\ remote=/\ withData=true
\f[]
.fi
.SS cache/fetch: Fetch file chunks {#cache/fetch}
.PP
Ensure the specified file chunks are cached on disk.
.PP
The chunks= parameter specifies the file chunks to check.
It takes a comma separated list of array slice indices.
The slice indices are similar to Python slices: start[:end]
.PP
start is the 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the file to
fetch inclusive.
end is 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the file to fetch
exclusive.
Both values can be negative, in which case they count from the back of
the file.
The value \[lq]\-5:\[rq] represents the last 5 chunks of a file.
.PP
Some valid examples are: \[lq]:5,\-5:\[rq] \-> the first and last five
chunks \[lq]0,\-2\[rq] \-> the first and the second last chunk
\[lq]0:10\[rq] \-> the first ten chunks
.PP
Any parameter with a key that starts with \[lq]file\[rq] can be used to
specify files to fetch, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ rc\ cache/fetch\ chunks=0\ file=hello\ file2=home/goodbye

Authentication\ is\ required\ for\ this\ call.

###\ vfs/forget:\ Forget\ files\ or\ directories\ in\ the\ directory\ cache.\ {#vfs/forget}

This\ forgets\ the\ paths\ in\ the\ directory\ cache\ causing\ them\ to\ be
re\-read\ from\ the\ remote\ when\ needed.

If\ no\ paths\ are\ passed\ in\ then\ it\ will\ forget\ all\ the\ paths\ in\ the
directory\ cache.

\ \ \ \ rclone\ rc\ vfs/forget

Otherwise\ pass\ files\ or\ dirs\ in\ as\ file=path\ or\ dir=path.\ \ Any
parameter\ key\ starting\ with\ file\ will\ forget\ that\ file\ and\ any
starting\ with\ dir\ will\ forget\ that\ dir,\ eg

\ \ \ \ rclone\ rc\ vfs/forget\ file=hello\ file2=goodbye\ dir=home/junk

###\ vfs/poll\-interval:\ Get\ the\ status\ or\ update\ the\ value\ of\ the\ poll\-interval\ option.\ {#vfs/poll\-interval}

Without\ any\ parameter\ given\ this\ returns\ the\ current\ status\ of\ the
poll\-interval\ setting.

When\ the\ interval=duration\ parameter\ is\ set,\ the\ poll\-interval\ value
is\ updated\ and\ the\ polling\ function\ is\ notified.
Setting\ interval=0\ disables\ poll\-interval.

\ \ \ \ rclone\ rc\ vfs/poll\-interval\ interval=5m

The\ timeout=duration\ parameter\ can\ be\ used\ to\ specify\ a\ time\ to\ wait
for\ the\ current\ poll\ function\ to\ apply\ the\ new\ value.
If\ timeout\ is\ less\ or\ equal\ 0,\ which\ is\ the\ default,\ wait\ indefinitely.

The\ new\ poll\-interval\ value\ will\ only\ be\ active\ when\ the\ timeout\ is
not\ reached.

If\ poll\-interval\ is\ updated\ or\ disabled\ temporarily,\ some\ changes
might\ not\ get\ picked\ up\ by\ the\ polling\ function,\ depending\ on\ the
used\ remote.

###\ vfs/refresh:\ Refresh\ the\ directory\ cache.\ {#vfs/refresh}

This\ reads\ the\ directories\ for\ the\ specified\ paths\ and\ freshens\ the
directory\ cache.

If\ no\ paths\ are\ passed\ in\ then\ it\ will\ refresh\ the\ root\ directory.

\ \ \ \ rclone\ rc\ vfs/refresh

Otherwise\ pass\ directories\ in\ as\ dir=path.\ Any\ parameter\ key
starting\ with\ dir\ will\ refresh\ that\ directory,\ eg

\ \ \ \ rclone\ rc\ vfs/refresh\ dir=home/junk\ dir2=data/misc

If\ the\ parameter\ recursive=true\ is\ given\ the\ whole\ directory\ tree
will\ get\ refreshed.\ This\ refresh\ will\ use\ \-\-fast\-list\ if\ enabled.

<!\-\-\-\ autogenerated\ stop\ \-\->

##\ Accessing\ the\ remote\ control\ via\ HTTP

Rclone\ implements\ a\ simple\ HTTP\ based\ protocol.

Each\ endpoint\ takes\ an\ JSON\ object\ and\ returns\ a\ JSON\ object\ or\ an
error.\ \ The\ JSON\ objects\ are\ essentially\ a\ map\ of\ string\ names\ to
values.

All\ calls\ must\ made\ using\ POST.

The\ input\ objects\ can\ be\ supplied\ using\ URL\ parameters,\ POST
parameters\ or\ by\ supplying\ "Content\-Type:\ application/json"\ and\ a\ JSON
blob\ in\ the\ body.\ \ There\ are\ examples\ of\ these\ below\ using\ `curl`.

The\ response\ will\ be\ a\ JSON\ blob\ in\ the\ body\ of\ the\ response.\ \ This\ is
formatted\ to\ be\ reasonably\ human\ readable.

###\ Error\ returns

If\ an\ error\ occurs\ then\ there\ will\ be\ an\ HTTP\ error\ status\ (eg\ 500)
and\ the\ body\ of\ the\ response\ will\ contain\ a\ JSON\ encoded\ error\ object,
eg
\f[]

\[lq]operations/rmdir\[rq], }
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

The\ keys\ in\ the\ error\ response\ are

\-\ input\ \-\ the\ input\ parameters\ to\ the\ call
\-\ status\ \-\ the\ HTTP\ status\ code
\-\ path\ \-\ the\ path\ of\ the\ call

###\ CORS

###\ Debugging\ go\ routine\ leaks

Memory\ leaks\ are\ most\ often\ caused\ by\ go\ routine\ leaks\ keeping\ memory
alive\ which\ should\ have\ been\ garbage\ collected.

See\ all\ active\ go\ routines\ using

\ \ \ \ curl\ http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1

Or\ go\ to\ http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1\ in\ your\ browser.

###\ Other\ profiles\ to\ look\ at

You\ can\ see\ a\ summary\ of\ profiles\ available\ at\ http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/

Here\ is\ how\ to\ use\ some\ of\ them:

\ \ *\ Memory:\ `go\ tool\ pprof\ http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap`
\ \ *\ Go\ routines:\ `curl\ http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1`
\ \ *\ 30\-second\ CPU\ profile:\ `go\ tool\ pprof\ http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/profile`
\ \ *\ 5\-second\ execution\ trace:\ `wget\ http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/trace?seconds=5`

See\ the\ [net/http/pprof\ docs](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/)
for\ more\ info\ on\ how\ to\ use\ the\ profiling\ and\ for\ a\ general\ overview
see\ [the\ Go\ team\[aq]s\ blog\ post\ on\ profiling\ go\ programs](https://blog.golang.org/profiling\-go\-programs).

The\ profiling\ hook\ is\ [zero\ overhead\ unless\ it\ is\ used](https://stackoverflow.com/q/26545159/164234).

#\ Overview\ of\ cloud\ storage\ systems\ #

Each\ cloud\ storage\ system\ is\ slightly\ different.\ \ Rclone\ attempts\ to

###\ Hash\ ###

The\ cloud\ storage\ system\ supports\ various\ hash\ types\ of\ the\ objects.
The\ hashes\ are\ used\ when\ transferring\ data\ as\ an\ integrity\ check\ and
can\ be\ specifically\ used\ with\ the\ `\-\-checksum`\ flag\ in\ syncs\ and\ in
the\ `check`\ command.

To\ use\ the\ verify\ checksums\ when\ transferring\ between\ cloud\ storage
systems\ they\ must\ support\ a\ common\ hash\ type.

†\ Note\ that\ Dropbox\ supports\ [its\ own\ custom
hash](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/content\-hash).
This\ is\ an\ SHA256\ sum\ of\ all\ the\ 4MB\ block\ SHA256s.

‡\ SFTP\ supports\ checksums\ if\ the\ same\ login\ has\ shell\ access\ and\ `md5sum`
or\ `sha1sum`\ as\ well\ as\ `echo`\ are\ in\ the\ remote\[aq]s\ PATH.

††\ WebDAV\ supports\ hashes\ when\ used\ with\ Owncloud\ and\ Nextcloud\ only.

†††\ WebDAV\ supports\ modtimes\ when\ used\ with\ Owncloud\ and\ Nextcloud\ only.

‡‡\ Microsoft\ OneDrive\ Personal\ supports\ SHA1\ hashes,\ whereas\ OneDrive
for\ business\ and\ SharePoint\ server\ support\ Microsoft\[aq]s\ own
[QuickXorHash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en\-us/onedrive/developer/code\-snippets/quickxorhash).

‡‡‡\ Mail.ru\ uses\ its\ own\ modified\ SHA1\ hash

###\ ModTime\ ###

The\ cloud\ storage\ system\ supports\ setting\ modification\ times\ on
objects.\ \ If\ it\ does\ then\ this\ enables\ a\ using\ the\ modification\ times
as\ part\ of\ the\ sync.\ \ If\ not\ then\ only\ the\ size\ will\ be\ checked\ by
default,\ though\ the\ MD5SUM\ can\ be\ checked\ with\ the\ `\-\-checksum`\ flag.

All\ cloud\ storage\ systems\ support\ some\ kind\ of\ date\ on\ the\ object\ and
these\ will\ be\ set\ when\ transferring\ from\ the\ cloud\ storage\ system.

###\ Case\ Insensitive\ ###

If\ a\ cloud\ storage\ systems\ is\ case\ sensitive\ then\ it\ is\ possible\ to
have\ two\ files\ which\ differ\ only\ in\ case,\ eg\ `file.txt`\ and
`FILE.txt`.\ \ If\ a\ cloud\ storage\ system\ is\ case\ insensitive\ then\ that
isn\[aq]t\ possible.

This\ can\ cause\ problems\ when\ syncing\ between\ a\ case\ insensitive
system\ and\ a\ case\ sensitive\ system.\ \ The\ symptom\ of\ this\ is\ that\ no
matter\ how\ many\ times\ you\ run\ the\ sync\ it\ never\ completes\ fully.

The\ local\ filesystem\ and\ SFTP\ may\ or\ may\ not\ be\ case\ sensitive
depending\ on\ OS.

\ \ *\ Windows\ \-\ usually\ case\ insensitive,\ though\ case\ is\ preserved
\ \ *\ OSX\ \-\ usually\ case\ insensitive,\ though\ it\ is\ possible\ to\ format\ case\ sensitive
\ \ *\ Linux\ \-\ usually\ case\ sensitive,\ but\ there\ are\ case\ insensitive\ file\ systems\ (eg\ FAT\ formatted\ USB\ keys)

Most\ of\ the\ time\ this\ doesn\[aq]t\ cause\ any\ problems\ as\ people\ tend\ to
avoid\ files\ whose\ name\ differs\ only\ by\ case\ even\ on\ case\ sensitive
systems.

###\ Duplicate\ files\ ###

If\ a\ cloud\ storage\ system\ allows\ duplicate\ files\ then\ it\ can\ have\ two
objects\ with\ the\ same\ name.

This\ confuses\ rclone\ greatly\ when\ syncing\ \-\ use\ the\ `rclone\ dedupe`
command\ to\ rename\ or\ remove\ duplicates.

###\ Restricted\ filenames\ ###

Some\ cloud\ storage\ systems\ might\ have\ restrictions\ on\ the\ characters
that\ are\ usable\ in\ file\ or\ directory\ names.
When\ `rclone`\ detects\ such\ a\ name\ during\ a\ file\ upload,\ it\ will
transparently\ replace\ the\ restricted\ characters\ with\ similar\ looking
Unicode\ characters.

This\ process\ is\ designed\ to\ avoid\ ambiguous\ file\ names\ as\ much\ as
possible\ and\ allow\ to\ move\ files\ between\ many\ cloud\ storage\ systems
transparently.

The\ name\ shown\ by\ `rclone`\ to\ the\ user\ or\ during\ log\ output\ will\ only
contain\ a\ minimal\ set\ of\ [replaced\ characters](#restricted\-characters)
to\ ensure\ correct\ formatting\ and\ not\ necessarily\ the\ actual\ name\ used
on\ the\ cloud\ storage.

This\ transformation\ is\ reversed\ when\ downloading\ a\ file\ or\ parsing
`rclone`\ arguments.
For\ example,\ when\ uploading\ a\ file\ named\ `my\ file?.txt`\ to\ Onedrive
will\ be\ displayed\ as\ `my\ file?.txt`\ on\ the\ console,\ but\ stored\ as
`my\ file？.txt`\ (the\ `?`\ gets\ replaced\ by\ the\ similar\ looking\ `？`
character)\ to\ Onedrive.
The\ reverse\ transformation\ allows\ to\ read\ a\ file`unusual/name.txt`
from\ Google\ Drive,\ by\ passing\ the\ name\ `unusual／name.txt`\ (the\ `/`\ needs
to\ be\ replaced\ by\ the\ similar\ looking\ `／`\ character)\ on\ the\ command\ line.

####\ Default\ restricted\ characters\ {#restricted\-characters}

The\ table\ below\ shows\ the\ characters\ that\ are\ replaced\ by\ default.

When\ a\ replacement\ character\ is\ found\ in\ a\ filename,\ this\ character
will\ be\ escaped\ with\ the\ `‛`\ character\ to\ avoid\ ambiguous\ file\ names.
(e.g.\ a\ file\ named\ `␀.txt`\ would\ shown\ as\ `‛␀.txt`)

Each\ cloud\ storage\ backend\ can\ use\ a\ different\ set\ of\ characters,
which\ will\ be\ specified\ in\ the\ documentation\ for\ each\ backend.

|\ DEL\ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ 0x7F\ \ |\ ␡\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |

The\ default\ encoding\ will\ also\ encode\ these\ file\ names\ as\ they\ are
problematic\ with\ many\ cloud\ storage\ systems.

|\ File\ name\ |\ Replacement\ |
|\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |:\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-:|
|\ .\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ ．\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |
|\ ..\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ ．．\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |

####\ Invalid\ UTF\-8\ bytes\ {#invalid\-utf8}

Some\ backends\ only\ support\ a\ sequence\ of\ well\ formed\ UTF\-8\ bytes
as\ file\ or\ directory\ names.

In\ this\ case\ all\ invalid\ UTF\-8\ bytes\ will\ be\ replaced\ with\ a\ quoted
representation\ of\ the\ byte\ value\ to\ allow\ uploading\ a\ file\ to\ such\ a
backend.\ For\ example,\ the\ invalid\ byte\ `0xFE`\ will\ be\ encoded\ as\ `‛FE`.

A\ common\ source\ of\ invalid\ UTF\-8\ bytes\ are\ local\ filesystems,\ that\ store
names\ in\ a\ different\ encoding\ than\ UTF\-8\ or\ UTF\-16,\ like\ latin1.\ See\ the
[local\ filenames](/local/#filenames)\ section\ for\ details.

###\ MIME\ Type\ ###

MIME\ types\ (also\ known\ as\ media\ types)\ classify\ types\ of\ documents
using\ a\ simple\ text\ classification,\ eg\ `text/html`\ or
`application/pdf`.

Some\ cloud\ storage\ systems\ support\ reading\ (`R`)\ the\ MIME\ type\ of
objects\ and\ some\ support\ writing\ (`W`)\ the\ MIME\ type\ of\ objects.

The\ MIME\ type\ can\ be\ important\ if\ you\ are\ serving\ files\ directly\ to
HTTP\ from\ the\ storage\ system.

If\ you\ are\ copying\ from\ a\ remote\ which\ supports\ reading\ (`R`)\ to\ a
remote\ which\ supports\ writing\ (`W`)\ then\ rclone\ will\ preserve\ the\ MIME
types.\ \ Otherwise\ they\ will\ be\ guessed\ from\ the\ extension,\ or\ the
remote\ itself\ may\ assign\ the\ MIME\ type.

##\ Optional\ Features\ ##

All\ the\ remotes\ support\ a\ basic\ set\ of\ features,\ but\ there\ are\ some
optional\ features\ supported\ by\ some\ remotes\ used\ to\ make\ some
operations\ more\ efficient.

###\ Purge\ ###

This\ deletes\ a\ directory\ quicker\ than\ just\ deleting\ all\ the\ files\ in
the\ directory.

†\ Note\ Swift\ and\ Hubic\ implement\ this\ in\ order\ to\ delete\ directory
markers\ but\ they\ don\[aq]t\ actually\ have\ a\ quicker\ way\ of\ deleting\ files
other\ than\ deleting\ them\ individually.

‡\ StreamUpload\ is\ not\ supported\ with\ Nextcloud

###\ Copy\ ###

Used\ when\ copying\ an\ object\ to\ and\ from\ the\ same\ remote.\ \ This\ known
as\ a\ server\ side\ copy\ so\ you\ can\ copy\ a\ file\ without\ downloading\ it
and\ uploading\ it\ again.\ \ It\ is\ used\ if\ you\ use\ `rclone\ copy`\ or
`rclone\ move`\ if\ the\ remote\ doesn\[aq]t\ support\ `Move`\ directly.

If\ the\ server\ doesn\[aq]t\ support\ `Copy`\ directly\ then\ for\ copy\ operations
the\ file\ is\ downloaded\ then\ re\-uploaded.

###\ Move\ ###

Used\ when\ moving/renaming\ an\ object\ on\ the\ same\ remote.\ \ This\ is\ known
as\ a\ server\ side\ move\ of\ a\ file.\ \ This\ is\ used\ in\ `rclone\ move`\ if\ the
server\ doesn\[aq]t\ support\ `DirMove`.

If\ the\ server\ isn\[aq]t\ capable\ of\ `Move`\ then\ rclone\ simulates\ it\ with
`Copy`\ then\ delete.\ \ If\ the\ server\ doesn\[aq]t\ support\ `Copy`\ then\ rclone
will\ download\ the\ file\ and\ re\-upload\ it.

###\ DirMove\ ###

This\ is\ used\ to\ implement\ `rclone\ move`\ to\ move\ a\ directory\ if
possible.\ \ If\ it\ isn\[aq]t\ then\ it\ will\ use\ `Move`\ on\ each\ file\ (which
falls\ back\ to\ `Copy`\ then\ download\ and\ upload\ \-\ see\ `Move`\ section).

###\ CleanUp\ ###

This\ is\ used\ for\ emptying\ the\ trash\ for\ a\ remote\ by\ `rclone\ cleanup`.

If\ the\ server\ can\[aq]t\ do\ `CleanUp`\ then\ `rclone\ cleanup`\ will\ return\ an
error.

###\ ListR\ ###

The\ remote\ supports\ a\ recursive\ list\ to\ list\ all\ the\ contents\ beneath
a\ directory\ quickly.\ \ This\ enables\ the\ `\-\-fast\-list`\ flag\ to\ work.
See\ the\ [rclone\ docs](/docs/#fast\-list)\ for\ more\ details.

###\ StreamUpload\ ###

Some\ remotes\ allow\ files\ to\ be\ uploaded\ without\ knowing\ the\ file\ size
in\ advance.\ This\ allows\ certain\ operations\ to\ work\ without\ spooling\ the
file\ to\ local\ disk\ first,\ e.g.\ `rclone\ rcat`.

###\ LinkSharing\ ###

Sets\ the\ necessary\ permissions\ on\ a\ file\ or\ folder\ and\ prints\ a\ link
that\ allows\ others\ to\ access\ them,\ even\ if\ they\ don\[aq]t\ have\ an\ account
on\ the\ particular\ cloud\ provider.

###\ About\ ###

This\ is\ used\ to\ fetch\ quota\ information\ from\ the\ remote,\ like\ bytes
used/free/quota\ and\ bytes\ used\ in\ the\ trash.

This\ is\ also\ used\ to\ return\ the\ space\ used,\ available\ for\ `rclone\ mount`.

If\ the\ server\ can\[aq]t\ do\ `About`\ then\ `rclone\ about`\ will\ return\ an
error.

###\ EmptyDir\ ###

The\ remote\ supports\ empty\ directories.\ See\ [Limitations](/bugs/#limitations)
\ for\ details.\ Most\ Object/Bucket\ based\ remotes\ do\ not\ support\ this.

#\ Global\ Flags

This\ describes\ the\ global\ flags\ available\ to\ every\ rclone\ command
split\ into\ two\ groups,\ non\ backend\ and\ backend\ flags.

##\ Non\ Backend\ Flags

These\ flags\ are\ available\ for\ every\ command.

This\ is\ a\ backend\ for\ the\ [1ficher](https://1fichier.com)\ cloud
storage\ service.\ Note\ that\ a\ Premium\ subscription\ is\ required\ to\ use
the\ API.

Paths\ are\ specified\ as\ `remote:path`

Paths\ may\ be\ as\ deep\ as\ required,\ eg\ `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

The\ initial\ setup\ for\ 1Fichier\ involves\ getting\ the\ API\ key\ from\ the\ website\ which\ you
need\ to\ do\ in\ your\ browser.

Here\ is\ an\ example\ of\ how\ to\ make\ a\ remote\ called\ `remote`.\ \ First\ run:

\ \ \ \ \ rclone\ config

This\ will\ guide\ you\ through\ an\ interactive\ setup\ process:

Once\ configured\ you\ can\ then\ use\ `rclone`\ like\ this,

List\ directories\ in\ top\ level\ of\ your\ 1Fichier\ account

\ \ \ \ rclone\ lsd\ remote:

List\ all\ the\ files\ in\ your\ 1Fichier\ account

\ \ \ \ rclone\ ls\ remote:

To\ copy\ a\ local\ directory\ to\ a\ 1Fichier\ directory\ called\ backup

\ \ \ \ rclone\ copy\ /home/source\ remote:backup

###\ Modified\ time\ and\ hashes\ ###

1Fichier\ does\ not\ support\ modification\ times.\ It\ supports\ the\ Whirlpool\ hash\ algorithm.

###\ Duplicated\ files\ ###

1Fichier\ can\ have\ two\ files\ with\ exactly\ the\ same\ name\ and\ path\ (unlike\ a
normal\ file\ system).

Duplicated\ files\ cause\ problems\ with\ the\ syncing\ and\ you\ will\ see
messages\ in\ the\ log\ about\ duplicates.

####\ Restricted\ filename\ characters

In\ addition\ to\ the\ [default\ restricted\ characters\ set](/overview/#restricted\-characters)
the\ following\ characters\ are\ also\ replaced:

|\ Character\ |\ Value\ |\ Replacement\ |
|\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |:\-\-\-\-\-:|:\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-:|

File\ names\ can\ also\ not\ start\ or\ end\ with\ the\ following\ characters.

Alias
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

The\ `alias`\ remote\ provides\ a\ new\ name\ for\ another\ remote.

Paths\ may\ be\ as\ deep\ as\ required\ or\ a\ local\ path,\ 
eg\ `remote:directory/subdirectory`\ or\ `/directory/subdirectory`.

During\ the\ initial\ setup\ with\ `rclone\ config`\ you\ will\ specify\ the\ target
remote.\ The\ target\ remote\ can\ either\ be\ a\ local\ path\ or\ another\ remote.

Subfolders\ can\ be\ used\ in\ target\ remote.\ Assume\ a\ alias\ remote\ named\ `backup`
with\ the\ target\ `mydrive:private/backup`.\ Invoking\ `rclone\ mkdir\ backup:desktop`
is\ exactly\ the\ same\ as\ invoking\ `rclone\ mkdir\ mydrive:private/backup/desktop`.

There\ will\ be\ no\ special\ handling\ of\ paths\ containing\ `..`\ segments.
Invoking\ `rclone\ mkdir\ backup:../desktop`\ is\ exactly\ the\ same\ as\ invoking
`rclone\ mkdir\ mydrive:private/backup/../desktop`.
The\ empty\ path\ is\ not\ allowed\ as\ a\ remote.\ To\ alias\ the\ current\ directory
use\ `.`\ instead.

Here\ is\ an\ example\ of\ how\ to\ make\ a\ alias\ called\ `remote`\ for\ local\ folder.
First\ run:

\ \ \ \ \ rclone\ config

Amazon\ Drive
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Amazon\ Drive,\ formerly\ known\ as\ Amazon\ Cloud\ Drive,\ is\ a\ cloud\ storage
service\ run\ by\ Amazon\ for\ consumers.

##\ Status

**Important:**\ rclone\ supports\ Amazon\ Drive\ only\ if\ you\ have\ your\ own
set\ of\ API\ keys.\ Unfortunately\ the\ [Amazon\ Drive\ developer
program](https://developer.amazon.com/amazon\-drive)\ is\ now\ closed\ to
new\ entries\ so\ if\ you\ don\[aq]t\ already\ have\ your\ own\ set\ of\ keys\ you\ will
not\ be\ able\ to\ use\ rclone\ with\ Amazon\ Drive.

For\ the\ history\ on\ why\ rclone\ no\ longer\ has\ a\ set\ of\ Amazon\ Drive\ API
keys\ see\ [the\ forum](https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone\-has\-been\-banned\-from\-amazon\-drive/2314).

If\ you\ happen\ to\ know\ anyone\ who\ works\ at\ Amazon\ then\ please\ ask\ them
to\ re\-instate\ rclone\ into\ the\ Amazon\ Drive\ developer\ program\ \-\ thanks!

##\ Setup

The\ initial\ setup\ for\ Amazon\ Drive\ involves\ getting\ a\ token\ from
Amazon\ which\ you\ need\ to\ do\ in\ your\ browser.\ \ `rclone\ config`\ walks
you\ through\ it.

The\ configuration\ process\ for\ Amazon\ Drive\ may\ involve\ using\ an\ [oauth
proxy](https://github.com/ncw/oauthproxy).\ This\ is\ used\ to\ keep\ the
Amazon\ credentials\ out\ of\ the\ source\ code.\ \ The\ proxy\ runs\ in\ Google\[aq]s
very\ secure\ App\ Engine\ environment\ and\ doesn\[aq]t\ store\ any\ credentials
which\ pass\ through\ it.

Since\ rclone\ doesn\[aq]t\ currently\ have\ its\ own\ Amazon\ Drive\ credentials
so\ you\ will\ either\ need\ to\ have\ your\ own\ `client_id`\ and
`client_secret`\ with\ Amazon\ Drive,\ or\ use\ a\ a\ third\ party\ ouath\ proxy
in\ which\ case\ you\ will\ need\ to\ enter\ `client_id`,\ `client_secret`,
`auth_url`\ and\ `token_url`.

Note\ also\ if\ you\ are\ not\ using\ Amazon\[aq]s\ `auth_url`\ and\ `token_url`,
(ie\ you\ filled\ in\ something\ for\ those)\ then\ if\ setting\ up\ on\ a\ remote
machine\ you\ can\ only\ use\ the\ [copying\ the\ config\ method\ of
configuration](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/#configuring\-by\-copying\-the\-config\-file)
\-\ `rclone\ authorize`\ will\ not\ work.

Here\ is\ an\ example\ of\ how\ to\ make\ a\ remote\ called\ `remote`.\ \ First\ run:

\ \ \ \ \ rclone\ config

This\ will\ guide\ you\ through\ an\ interactive\ setup\ process:

See\ the\ [remote\ setup\ docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/)\ for\ how\ to\ set\ it\ up\ on\ a
machine\ with\ no\ Internet\ browser\ available.

Note\ that\ rclone\ runs\ a\ webserver\ on\ your\ local\ machine\ to\ collect\ the
token\ as\ returned\ from\ Amazon.\ This\ only\ runs\ from\ the\ moment\ it
opens\ your\ browser\ to\ the\ moment\ you\ get\ back\ the\ verification
code.\ \ This\ is\ on\ `http://127.0.0.1:53682/`\ and\ this\ it\ may\ require
you\ to\ unblock\ it\ temporarily\ if\ you\ are\ running\ a\ host\ firewall.

Once\ configured\ you\ can\ then\ use\ `rclone`\ like\ this,

List\ directories\ in\ top\ level\ of\ your\ Amazon\ Drive

\ \ \ \ rclone\ lsd\ remote:

List\ all\ the\ files\ in\ your\ Amazon\ Drive

\ \ \ \ rclone\ ls\ remote:

To\ copy\ a\ local\ directory\ to\ an\ Amazon\ Drive\ directory\ called\ backup

\ \ \ \ rclone\ copy\ /home/source\ remote:backup

###\ Modified\ time\ and\ MD5SUMs\ ###

Amazon\ Drive\ doesn\[aq]t\ allow\ modification\ times\ to\ be\ changed\ via
the\ API\ so\ these\ won\[aq]t\ be\ accurate\ or\ used\ for\ syncing.

It\ does\ store\ MD5SUMs\ so\ for\ a\ more\ accurate\ sync,\ you\ can\ use\ the
`\-\-checksum`\ flag.

####\ Restricted\ filename\ characters

Invalid\ UTF\-8\ bytes\ will\ also\ be\ [replaced](/overview/#invalid\-utf8),
as\ they\ can\[aq]t\ be\ used\ in\ JSON\ strings.

###\ Deleting\ files\ ###

Any\ files\ you\ delete\ with\ rclone\ will\ end\ up\ in\ the\ trash.\ \ Amazon
don\[aq]t\ provide\ an\ API\ to\ permanently\ delete\ files,\ nor\ to\ empty\ the
trash,\ so\ you\ will\ have\ to\ do\ that\ with\ one\ of\ Amazon\[aq]s\ apps\ or\ via
the\ Amazon\ Drive\ website.\ As\ of\ November\ 17,\ 2016,\ files\ are\ 
automatically\ deleted\ by\ Amazon\ from\ the\ trash\ after\ 30\ days.

###\ Using\ with\ non\ `.com`\ Amazon\ accounts\ ###

Let\[aq]s\ say\ you\ usually\ use\ `amazon.co.uk`.\ When\ you\ authenticate\ with
rclone\ it\ will\ take\ you\ to\ an\ `amazon.com`\ page\ to\ log\ in.\ \ Your
`amazon.co.uk`\ email\ and\ password\ should\ work\ here\ just\ fine.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ checkpoint
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_ACD_CHECKPOINT
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ string
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ ""

####\ \-\-acd\-upload\-wait\-per\-gb

Additional\ time\ per\ GB\ to\ wait\ after\ a\ failed\ complete\ upload\ to\ see\ if\ it\ appears.

Sometimes\ Amazon\ Drive\ gives\ an\ error\ when\ a\ file\ has\ been\ fully
uploaded\ but\ the\ file\ appears\ anyway\ after\ a\ little\ while.\ \ This
happens\ sometimes\ for\ files\ over\ 1GB\ in\ size\ and\ nearly\ every\ time\ for
files\ bigger\ than\ 10GB.\ This\ parameter\ controls\ the\ time\ rclone\ waits
for\ the\ file\ to\ appear.

The\ default\ value\ for\ this\ parameter\ is\ 3\ minutes\ per\ GB,\ so\ by
default\ it\ will\ wait\ 3\ minutes\ for\ every\ GB\ uploaded\ to\ see\ if\ the
file\ appears.

You\ can\ disable\ this\ feature\ by\ setting\ it\ to\ 0.\ This\ may\ cause
conflict\ errors\ as\ rclone\ retries\ the\ failed\ upload\ but\ the\ file\ will
most\ likely\ appear\ correctly\ eventually.

These\ values\ were\ determined\ empirically\ by\ observing\ lots\ of\ uploads
of\ big\ files\ for\ a\ range\ of\ file\ sizes.

Upload\ with\ the\ "\-v"\ flag\ to\ see\ more\ info\ about\ what\ rclone\ is\ doing
in\ this\ situation.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ upload_wait_per_gb
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_ACD_UPLOAD_WAIT_PER_GB
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Duration
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ 3m0s

####\ \-\-acd\-templink\-threshold

Files\ >=\ this\ size\ will\ be\ downloaded\ via\ their\ tempLink.

Files\ this\ size\ or\ more\ will\ be\ downloaded\ via\ their\ "tempLink".\ This
is\ to\ work\ around\ a\ problem\ with\ Amazon\ Drive\ which\ blocks\ downloads
of\ files\ bigger\ than\ about\ 10GB.\ \ The\ default\ for\ this\ is\ 9GB\ which
shouldn\[aq]t\ need\ to\ be\ changed.

To\ download\ files\ above\ this\ threshold,\ rclone\ requests\ a\ "tempLink"
which\ downloads\ the\ file\ through\ a\ temporary\ URL\ directly\ from\ the
underlying\ S3\ storage.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ templink_threshold
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_ACD_TEMPLINK_THRESHOLD
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ SizeSuffix
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ 9G

<!\-\-\-\ autogenerated\ options\ stop\ \-\->

###\ Limitations\ ###

Note\ that\ Amazon\ Drive\ is\ case\ insensitive\ so\ you\ can\[aq]t\ have\ a
file\ called\ "Hello.doc"\ and\ one\ called\ "hello.doc".

Amazon\ Drive\ has\ rate\ limiting\ so\ you\ may\ notice\ errors\ in\ the
sync\ (429\ errors).\ \ rclone\ will\ automatically\ retry\ the\ sync\ up\ to\ 3
times\ by\ default\ (see\ `\-\-retries`\ flag)\ which\ should\ hopefully\ work
around\ this\ problem.

Amazon\ Drive\ has\ an\ internal\ limit\ of\ file\ sizes\ that\ can\ be\ uploaded
to\ the\ service.\ This\ limit\ is\ not\ officially\ published,\ but\ all\ files
larger\ than\ this\ will\ fail.

At\ the\ time\ of\ writing\ (Jan\ 2016)\ is\ in\ the\ area\ of\ 50GB\ per\ file.
This\ means\ that\ larger\ files\ are\ likely\ to\ fail.

Unfortunately\ there\ is\ no\ way\ for\ rclone\ to\ see\ that\ this\ failure\ is
because\ of\ file\ size,\ so\ it\ will\ retry\ the\ operation,\ as\ any\ other
failure.\ To\ avoid\ this\ problem,\ use\ `\-\-max\-size\ 50000M`\ option\ to\ limit
the\ maximum\ size\ of\ uploaded\ files.\ Note\ that\ `\-\-max\-size`\ does\ not\ split
files\ into\ segments,\ it\ only\ ignores\ files\ over\ this\ size.

Amazon\ S3\ Storage\ Providers
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

The\ S3\ backend\ can\ be\ used\ with\ a\ number\ of\ different\ providers:

*\ AWS\ S3
*\ Alibaba\ Cloud\ (Aliyun)\ Object\ Storage\ System\ (OSS)
*\ Ceph
*\ DigitalOcean\ Spaces
*\ Dreamhost
*\ IBM\ COS\ S3
*\ Minio
*\ Wasabi

Paths\ are\ specified\ as\ `remote:bucket`\ (or\ `remote:`\ for\ the\ `lsd`
command.)\ \ You\ may\ put\ subdirectories\ in\ too,\ eg\ `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

Once\ you\ have\ made\ a\ remote\ (see\ the\ provider\ specific\ section\ above)
you\ can\ use\ it\ like\ this:

See\ all\ buckets

\ \ \ \ rclone\ lsd\ remote:

Make\ a\ new\ bucket

\ \ \ \ rclone\ mkdir\ remote:bucket

List\ the\ contents\ of\ a\ bucket

\ \ \ \ rclone\ ls\ remote:bucket

Sync\ `/home/local/directory`\ to\ the\ remote\ bucket,\ deleting\ any\ excess
files\ in\ the\ bucket.

\ \ \ \ rclone\ sync\ /home/local/directory\ remote:bucket

###\ \-\-fast\-list\ ###

This\ remote\ supports\ `\-\-fast\-list`\ which\ allows\ you\ to\ use\ fewer
transactions\ in\ exchange\ for\ more\ memory.\ See\ the\ [rclone
docs](/docs/#fast\-list)\ for\ more\ details.

###\ \-\-update\ and\ \-\-use\-server\-modtime\ ###

As\ noted\ below,\ the\ modified\ time\ is\ stored\ on\ metadata\ on\ the\ object.\ It\ is
used\ by\ default\ for\ all\ operations\ that\ require\ checking\ the\ time\ a\ file\ was
last\ updated.\ It\ allows\ rclone\ to\ treat\ the\ remote\ more\ like\ a\ true\ filesystem,
but\ it\ is\ inefficient\ because\ it\ requires\ an\ extra\ API\ call\ to\ retrieve\ the
metadata.

For\ many\ operations,\ the\ time\ the\ object\ was\ last\ uploaded\ to\ the\ remote\ is
sufficient\ to\ determine\ if\ it\ is\ "dirty".\ By\ using\ `\-\-update`\ along\ with
`\-\-use\-server\-modtime`,\ you\ can\ avoid\ the\ extra\ API\ call\ and\ simply\ upload
files\ whose\ local\ modtime\ is\ newer\ than\ the\ time\ it\ was\ last\ uploaded.

###\ Modified\ time\ ###

The\ modified\ time\ is\ stored\ as\ metadata\ on\ the\ object\ as
`X\-Amz\-Meta\-Mtime`\ as\ floating\ point\ since\ the\ epoch\ accurate\ to\ 1\ ns.

If\ the\ modification\ time\ needs\ to\ be\ updated\ rclone\ will\ attempt\ to\ perform\ a\ server
side\ copy\ to\ update\ the\ modification\ if\ the\ object\ can\ be\ copied\ in\ a\ single\ part.\ \ 
In\ the\ case\ the\ object\ is\ larger\ than\ 5Gb\ or\ is\ in\ Glacier\ or\ Glacier\ Deep\ Archive\ 
storage\ the\ object\ will\ be\ uploaded\ rather\ than\ copied.

####\ Restricted\ filename\ characters

S3\ allows\ any\ valid\ UTF\-8\ string\ as\ a\ key.

Invalid\ UTF\-8\ bytes\ will\ be\ [replaced](/overview/#invalid\-utf8),\ as
they\ can\[aq]t\ be\ used\ in\ XML.

The\ following\ characters\ are\ replaced\ since\ these\ are\ problematic\ when
dealing\ with\ the\ REST\ API:

|\ Character\ |\ Value\ |\ Replacement\ |
|\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |:\-\-\-\-\-:|:\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-:|
|\ NUL\ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ 0x00\ \ |\ ␀\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |
|\ /\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ 0x2F\ \ |\ ／\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |

The\ encoding\ will\ also\ encode\ these\ file\ names\ as\ they\ don\[aq]t\ seem\ to
work\ with\ the\ SDK\ properly:

|\ File\ name\ |\ Replacement\ |
|\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |:\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-:|
|\ .\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ ．\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |
|\ ..\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ ．．\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |

###\ Multipart\ uploads\ ###

rclone\ supports\ multipart\ uploads\ with\ S3\ which\ means\ that\ it\ can
upload\ files\ bigger\ than\ 5GB.

Note\ that\ files\ uploaded\ *both*\ with\ multipart\ upload\ *and*\ through
crypt\ remotes\ do\ not\ have\ MD5\ sums.

rclone\ switches\ from\ single\ part\ uploads\ to\ multipart\ uploads\ at\ the
point\ specified\ by\ `\-\-s3\-upload\-cutoff`.\ \ This\ can\ be\ a\ maximum\ of\ 5GB
and\ a\ minimum\ of\ 0\ (ie\ always\ upload\ multipart\ files).

The\ chunk\ sizes\ used\ in\ the\ multipart\ upload\ are\ specified\ by
`\-\-s3\-chunk\-size`\ and\ the\ number\ of\ chunks\ uploaded\ concurrently\ is
specified\ by\ `\-\-s3\-upload\-concurrency`.

Multipart\ uploads\ will\ use\ `\-\-transfers`\ *\ `\-\-s3\-upload\-concurrency`\ *
`\-\-s3\-chunk\-size`\ extra\ memory.\ \ Single\ part\ uploads\ to\ not\ use\ extra
memory.

Single\ part\ transfers\ can\ be\ faster\ than\ multipart\ transfers\ or\ slower
depending\ on\ your\ latency\ from\ S3\ \-\ the\ more\ latency,\ the\ more\ likely
single\ part\ transfers\ will\ be\ faster.

Increasing\ `\-\-s3\-upload\-concurrency`\ will\ increase\ throughput\ (8\ would
be\ a\ sensible\ value)\ and\ increasing\ `\-\-s3\-chunk\-size`\ also\ increases
throughput\ (16M\ would\ be\ sensible).\ \ Increasing\ either\ of\ these\ will
use\ more\ memory.\ \ The\ default\ values\ are\ high\ enough\ to\ gain\ most\ of
the\ possible\ performance\ without\ using\ too\ much\ memory.


###\ Buckets\ and\ Regions\ ###

With\ Amazon\ S3\ you\ can\ list\ buckets\ (`rclone\ lsd`)\ using\ any\ region,
but\ you\ can\ only\ access\ the\ content\ of\ a\ bucket\ from\ the\ region\ it\ was
created\ in.\ \ If\ you\ attempt\ to\ access\ a\ bucket\ from\ the\ wrong\ region,
you\ will\ get\ an\ error,\ `incorrect\ region,\ the\ bucket\ is\ not\ in\ \[aq]XXX\[aq]
region`.

###\ Authentication\ ###

There\ are\ a\ number\ of\ ways\ to\ supply\ `rclone`\ with\ a\ set\ of\ AWS
credentials,\ with\ and\ without\ using\ the\ environment.

The\ different\ authentication\ methods\ are\ tried\ in\ this\ order:

\ \-\ Directly\ in\ the\ rclone\ configuration\ file\ (`env_auth\ =\ false`\ in\ the\ config\ file):
\ \ \ \-\ `access_key_id`\ and\ `secret_access_key`\ are\ required.
\ \ \ \-\ `session_token`\ can\ be\ optionally\ set\ when\ using\ AWS\ STS.
\ \-\ Runtime\ configuration\ (`env_auth\ =\ true`\ in\ the\ config\ file):
\ \ \ \-\ Export\ the\ following\ environment\ variables\ before\ running\ `rclone`:
\ \ \ \ \ \-\ Access\ Key\ ID:\ `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`\ or\ `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`
\ \ \ \ \ \-\ Secret\ Access\ Key:\ `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`\ or\ `AWS_SECRET_KEY`
\ \ \ \ \ \-\ Session\ Token:\ `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`\ (optional)
\ \ \ \-\ Or,\ use\ a\ [named\ profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli\-multiple\-profiles.html):
\ \ \ \ \ \-\ Profile\ files\ are\ standard\ files\ used\ by\ AWS\ CLI\ tools
\ \ \ \ \ \-\ By\ default\ it\ will\ use\ the\ profile\ in\ your\ home\ directory\ (eg\ `~/.aws/credentials`\ on\ unix\ based\ systems)\ file\ and\ the\ "default"\ profile,\ to\ change\ set\ these\ environment\ variables:
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`\ to\ control\ which\ file.
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ `AWS_PROFILE`\ to\ control\ which\ profile\ to\ use.
\ \ \ \-\ Or,\ run\ `rclone`\ in\ an\ ECS\ task\ with\ an\ IAM\ role\ (AWS\ only).
\ \ \ \-\ Or,\ run\ `rclone`\ on\ an\ EC2\ instance\ with\ an\ IAM\ role\ (AWS\ only).

If\ none\ of\ these\ option\ actually\ end\ up\ providing\ `rclone`\ with\ AWS
credentials\ then\ S3\ interaction\ will\ be\ non\-authenticated\ (see\ below).

###\ S3\ Permissions\ ###

When\ using\ the\ `sync`\ subcommand\ of\ `rclone`\ the\ following\ minimum
permissions\ are\ required\ to\ be\ available\ on\ the\ bucket\ being\ written\ to:

*\ `ListBucket`
*\ `DeleteObject`
*\ `GetObject`
*\ `PutObject`
*\ `PutObjectACL`

When\ using\ the\ `lsd`\ subcommand,\ the\ `ListAllMyBuckets`\ permission\ is\ required.

Example\ policy:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
{ \[lq]Version\[rq]: \[lq]2012\-10\-17\[rq], \[lq]Statement\[rq]: [ {
\[lq]Effect\[rq]: \[lq]Allow\[rq], \[lq]Principal\[rq]: { \[lq]AWS\[rq]:
\[lq]arn:aws:iam::USER_SID:user/USER_NAME\[rq] }, \[lq]Action\[rq]: [
\[lq]s3:ListBucket\[rq], \[lq]s3:DeleteObject\[rq],
\[lq]s3:GetObject\[rq], \[lq]s3:PutObject\[rq],
\[lq]s3:PutObjectAcl\[rq] ], \[lq]Resource\[rq]: [
"arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*\[lq],\[rq]arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME" ] }, {
\[lq]Effect\[rq]: \[lq]Allow\[rq], \[lq]Action\[rq]:
\[lq]s3:ListAllMyBuckets\[rq], \[lq]Resource\[rq]: "arn:aws:s3:::*" }
.PD 0
.P
.PD
] }
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

Notes\ on\ above:

1.\ This\ is\ a\ policy\ that\ can\ be\ used\ when\ creating\ bucket.\ It\ assumes
\ \ \ that\ `USER_NAME`\ has\ been\ created.
2.\ The\ Resource\ entry\ must\ include\ both\ resource\ ARNs,\ as\ one\ implies
\ \ \ the\ bucket\ and\ the\ other\ implies\ the\ bucket\[aq]s\ objects.

For\ reference,\ [here\[aq]s\ an\ Ansible\ script](https://gist.github.com/ebridges/ebfc9042dd7c756cd101cfa807b7ae2b)
that\ will\ generate\ one\ or\ more\ buckets\ that\ will\ work\ with\ `rclone\ sync`.

###\ Key\ Management\ System\ (KMS)\ ###

If\ you\ are\ using\ server\ side\ encryption\ with\ KMS\ then\ you\ will\ find
you\ can\[aq]t\ transfer\ small\ objects.\ \ As\ a\ work\-around\ you\ can\ use\ the
`\-\-ignore\-checksum`\ flag.

A\ proper\ fix\ is\ being\ worked\ on\ in\ [issue\ #1824](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1824).

###\ Glacier\ and\ Glacier\ Deep\ Archive\ ###

You\ can\ upload\ objects\ using\ the\ glacier\ storage\ class\ or\ transition\ them\ to\ glacier\ using\ a\ [lifecycle\ policy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user\-guide/create\-lifecycle.html).
The\ bucket\ can\ still\ be\ synced\ or\ copied\ into\ normally,\ but\ if\ rclone
tries\ to\ access\ data\ from\ the\ glacier\ storage\ class\ you\ will\ see\ an\ error\ like\ below.

\ \ \ \ 2017/09/11\ 19:07:43\ Failed\ to\ sync:\ failed\ to\ open\ source\ object:\ Object\ in\ GLACIER,\ restore\ first:\ path/to/file

In\ this\ case\ you\ need\ to\ [restore](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user\-guide/restore\-archived\-objects.html)
the\ object(s)\ in\ question\ before\ using\ rclone.

Note\ that\ rclone\ only\ speaks\ the\ S3\ API\ it\ does\ not\ speak\ the\ Glacier
Vault\ API,\ so\ rclone\ cannot\ directly\ access\ Glacier\ Vaults.

####\ \-\-s3\-upload\-concurrency

Concurrency\ for\ multipart\ uploads.

This\ is\ the\ number\ of\ chunks\ of\ the\ same\ file\ that\ are\ uploaded
concurrently.

If\ you\ are\ uploading\ small\ numbers\ of\ large\ file\ over\ high\ speed\ link
and\ these\ uploads\ do\ not\ fully\ utilize\ your\ bandwidth,\ then\ increasing
this\ may\ help\ to\ speed\ up\ the\ transfers.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ upload_concurrency

Some\ providers\ (eg\ Aliyun\ OSS\ or\ Netease\ COS)\ require\ this\ set\ to\ false.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ force_path_style
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ bool
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ true

####\ \-\-s3\-v2\-auth

If\ true\ use\ v2\ authentication.

If\ this\ is\ false\ (the\ default)\ then\ rclone\ will\ use\ v4\ authentication.
If\ it\ is\ set\ then\ rclone\ will\ use\ v2\ authentication.

Use\ this\ only\ if\ v4\ signatures\ don\[aq]t\ work,\ eg\ pre\ Jewel/v10\ CEPH.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ v2_auth
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_S3_V2_AUTH
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ bool
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ false

####\ \-\-s3\-use\-accelerate\-endpoint

It\ should\ be\ set\ to\ true\ for\ resuming\ uploads\ across\ different\ sessions.

WARNING:\ Storing\ parts\ of\ an\ incomplete\ multipart\ upload\ counts\ towards\ space\ usage\ on\ S3\ and\ will\ add\ additional\ costs\ if\ not\ cleaned\ up.


\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ leave_parts_on_error
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_S3_LEAVE_PARTS_ON_ERROR
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ bool
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ false

###\ Anonymous\ access\ to\ public\ buckets\ ###

If\ you\ want\ to\ use\ rclone\ to\ access\ a\ public\ bucket,\ configure\ with\ a
blank\ `access_key_id`\ and\ `secret_access_key`.\ \ Your\ config\ should\ end
up\ looking\ like\ this:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
[anons3] type = s3 provider = AWS env_auth = false access_key_id =
secret_access_key = region = us\-east\-1 endpoint = location_constraint
= acl = private server_side_encryption = storage_class =
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

Then\ use\ it\ as\ normal\ with\ the\ name\ of\ the\ public\ bucket,\ eg

\ \ \ \ rclone\ lsd\ anons3:1000genomes

You\ will\ be\ able\ to\ list\ and\ copy\ data\ but\ not\ upload\ it.

###\ Ceph\ ###

[Ceph](https://ceph.com/)\ is\ an\ open\ source\ unified,\ distributed
storage\ system\ designed\ for\ excellent\ performance,\ reliability\ and
scalability.\ \ It\ has\ an\ S3\ compatible\ object\ storage\ interface.

To\ use\ rclone\ with\ Ceph,\ configure\ as\ above\ but\ leave\ the\ region\ blank
and\ set\ the\ endpoint.\ \ You\ should\ end\ up\ with\ something\ like\ this\ in
your\ config:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
[ceph] type = s3 provider = Ceph env_auth = false access_key_id = XXX
secret_access_key = YYY region = endpoint =
https://ceph.endpoint.example.com location_constraint = acl =
server_side_encryption = storage_class =
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

If\ you\ are\ using\ an\ older\ version\ of\ CEPH,\ eg\ 10.2.x\ Jewel,\ then\ you
may\ need\ to\ supply\ the\ parameter\ `\-\-s3\-upload\-cutoff\ 0`\ or\ put\ this\ in
the\ config\ file\ as\ `upload_cutoff\ 0`\ to\ work\ around\ a\ bug\ which\ causes
uploading\ of\ small\ files\ to\ fail.

Note\ also\ that\ Ceph\ sometimes\ puts\ `/`\ in\ the\ passwords\ it\ gives
users.\ \ If\ you\ read\ the\ secret\ access\ key\ using\ the\ command\ line\ tools
you\ will\ get\ a\ JSON\ blob\ with\ the\ `/`\ escaped\ as\ `\\/`.\ \ Make\ sure\ you
only\ write\ `/`\ in\ the\ secret\ access\ key.

Eg\ the\ dump\ from\ Ceph\ looks\ something\ like\ this\ (irrelevant\ keys
removed).
\f[]
.fi
.PP
{ \[lq]user_id\[rq]: \[lq]xxx\[rq], \[lq]display_name\[rq]:
\[lq]xxxx\[rq], \[lq]keys\[rq]: [ { \[lq]user\[rq]: \[lq]xxx\[rq],
\[lq]access_key\[rq]: \[lq]xxxxxx\[rq], \[lq]secret_key\[rq]:
\[lq]xxxxxx/xxxx\[rq] } ], }
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

Because\ this\ is\ a\ json\ dump,\ it\ is\ encoding\ the\ `/`\ as\ `\\/`,\ so\ if\ you
use\ the\ secret\ key\ as\ `xxxxxx/xxxx`\ \ it\ will\ work\ fine.

###\ Dreamhost\ ###

Dreamhost\ [DreamObjects](https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/)\ is
an\ object\ storage\ system\ based\ on\ CEPH.

To\ use\ rclone\ with\ Dreamhost,\ configure\ as\ above\ but\ leave\ the\ region\ blank
and\ set\ the\ endpoint.\ \ You\ should\ end\ up\ with\ something\ like\ this\ in
your\ config:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
[dreamobjects] type = s3 provider = DreamHost env_auth = false
access_key_id = your_access_key secret_access_key = your_secret_key
region = endpoint = objects\-us\-west\-1.dream.io location_constraint =
acl = private server_side_encryption = storage_class =
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

###\ DigitalOcean\ Spaces\ ###

[Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/object\-storage/)\ is\ an\ [S3\-interoperable](https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/spaces/)\ object\ storage\ service\ from\ cloud\ provider\ DigitalOcean.

To\ connect\ to\ DigitalOcean\ Spaces\ you\ will\ need\ an\ access\ key\ and\ secret\ key.\ These\ can\ be\ retrieved\ on\ the\ "[Applications\ &\ API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/api/tokens)"\ page\ of\ the\ DigitalOcean\ control\ panel.\ They\ will\ be\ needed\ when\ promted\ by\ `rclone\ config`\ for\ your\ `access_key_id`\ and\ `secret_access_key`.

When\ prompted\ for\ a\ `region`\ or\ `location_constraint`,\ press\ enter\ to\ use\ the\ default\ value.\ The\ region\ must\ be\ included\ in\ the\ `endpoint`\ setting\ (e.g.\ `nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com`).\ The\ default\ values\ can\ be\ used\ for\ other\ settings.

Going\ through\ the\ whole\ process\ of\ creating\ a\ new\ remote\ by\ running\ `rclone\ config`,\ each\ prompt\ should\ be\ answered\ as\ shown\ below:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Storage> s3 env_auth> 1 access_key_id> YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key> YOUR_SECRET_KEY region> endpoint>
nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com location_constraint> acl> storage_class>
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

The\ resulting\ configuration\ file\ should\ look\ like:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
[spaces] type = s3 provider = DigitalOcean env_auth = false
access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region = endpoint = nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com location_constraint =
acl = server_side_encryption = storage_class =
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

Once\ configured,\ you\ can\ create\ a\ new\ Space\ and\ begin\ copying\ files.\ For\ example:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
rclone mkdir spaces:my\-new\-space rclone copy /path/to/files
spaces:my\-new\-space
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

This\ remote\ is\ called\ `remote`\ and\ can\ now\ be\ used\ like\ this

See\ all\ buckets

\ \ \ \ rclone\ lsd\ remote:

Create\ a\ new\ bucket

\ \ \ \ rclone\ mkdir\ remote:bucket

List\ the\ contents\ of\ a\ bucket

\ \ \ \ rclone\ ls\ remote:bucket

Sync\ `/home/local/directory`\ to\ the\ remote\ bucket,\ deleting\ any
excess\ files\ in\ the\ bucket.

\ \ \ \ rclone\ sync\ /home/local/directory\ remote:bucket

###\ Application\ Keys\ ###

B2\ supports\ multiple\ [Application\ Keys\ for\ different\ access\ permission
to\ B2\ Buckets](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/application_keys.html).

You\ can\ use\ these\ with\ rclone\ too;\ you\ will\ need\ to\ use\ rclone\ version\ 1.43
or\ later.

Follow\ Backblaze\[aq]s\ docs\ to\ create\ an\ Application\ Key\ with\ the\ required
permission\ and\ add\ the\ `applicationKeyId`\ as\ the\ `account`\ and\ the
`Application\ Key`\ itself\ as\ the\ `key`.

Note\ that\ you\ must\ put\ the\ _applicationKeyId_\ as\ the\ `account`\ \[en]\ you
can\[aq]t\ use\ the\ master\ Account\ ID.\ \ If\ you\ try\ then\ B2\ will\ return\ 401
errors.

###\ \-\-fast\-list\ ###

This\ remote\ supports\ `\-\-fast\-list`\ which\ allows\ you\ to\ use\ fewer
transactions\ in\ exchange\ for\ more\ memory.\ See\ the\ [rclone
docs](/docs/#fast\-list)\ for\ more\ details.

###\ Modified\ time\ ###

The\ modified\ time\ is\ stored\ as\ metadata\ on\ the\ object\ as
`X\-Bz\-Info\-src_last_modified_millis`\ as\ milliseconds\ since\ 1970\-01\-01
in\ the\ Backblaze\ standard.\ \ Other\ tools\ should\ be\ able\ to\ use\ this\ as
a\ modified\ time.

Modified\ times\ are\ used\ in\ syncing\ and\ are\ fully\ supported.\ Note\ that
if\ a\ modification\ time\ needs\ to\ be\ updated\ on\ an\ object\ then\ it\ will
create\ a\ new\ version\ of\ the\ object.

####\ Restricted\ filename\ characters

In\ addition\ to\ the\ [default\ restricted\ characters\ set](/overview/#restricted\-characters)
the\ following\ characters\ are\ also\ replaced:

|\ Character\ |\ Value\ |\ Replacement\ |
|\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |:\-\-\-\-\-:|:\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-:|
|\ \\\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ 0x5C\ \ |\ ＼\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |

Invalid\ UTF\-8\ bytes\ will\ also\ be\ [replaced](/overview/#invalid\-utf8),
as\ they\ can\[aq]t\ be\ used\ in\ JSON\ strings.

###\ SHA1\ checksums\ ###

The\ SHA1\ checksums\ of\ the\ files\ are\ checked\ on\ upload\ and\ download\ and
will\ be\ used\ in\ the\ syncing\ process.

Large\ files\ (bigger\ than\ the\ limit\ in\ `\-\-b2\-upload\-cutoff`)\ which\ are
uploaded\ in\ chunks\ will\ store\ their\ SHA1\ on\ the\ object\ as
`X\-Bz\-Info\-large_file_sha1`\ as\ recommended\ by\ Backblaze.

For\ a\ large\ file\ to\ be\ uploaded\ with\ an\ SHA1\ checksum,\ the\ source
needs\ to\ support\ SHA1\ checksums.\ The\ local\ disk\ supports\ SHA1
checksums\ so\ large\ file\ transfers\ from\ local\ disk\ will\ have\ an\ SHA1.
See\ [the\ overview](/overview/#features)\ for\ exactly\ which\ remotes
support\ SHA1.

Sources\ which\ don\[aq]t\ support\ SHA1,\ in\ particular\ `crypt`\ will\ upload
large\ files\ without\ SHA1\ checksums.\ \ This\ may\ be\ fixed\ in\ the\ future
(see\ [#1767](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1767)).

Files\ sizes\ below\ `\-\-b2\-upload\-cutoff`\ will\ always\ have\ an\ SHA1
regardless\ of\ the\ source.

###\ Transfers\ ###

Backblaze\ recommends\ that\ you\ do\ lots\ of\ transfers\ simultaneously\ for
maximum\ speed.\ \ In\ tests\ from\ my\ SSD\ equipped\ laptop\ the\ optimum
setting\ is\ about\ `\-\-transfers\ 32`\ though\ higher\ numbers\ may\ be\ used
for\ a\ slight\ speed\ improvement.\ The\ optimum\ number\ for\ you\ may\ vary
depending\ on\ your\ hardware,\ how\ big\ the\ files\ are,\ how\ much\ you\ want
to\ load\ your\ computer,\ etc.\ \ The\ default\ of\ `\-\-transfers\ 4`\ is
definitely\ too\ low\ for\ Backblaze\ B2\ though.

Note\ that\ uploading\ big\ files\ (bigger\ than\ 200\ MB\ by\ default)\ will\ use
a\ 96\ MB\ RAM\ buffer\ by\ default.\ \ There\ can\ be\ at\ most\ `\-\-transfers`\ of
these\ in\ use\ at\ any\ moment,\ so\ this\ sets\ the\ upper\ limit\ on\ the\ memory
used.

###\ Versions\ ###

When\ rclone\ uploads\ a\ new\ version\ of\ a\ file\ it\ creates\ a\ [new\ version
of\ it](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/file_versions.html).
Likewise\ when\ you\ delete\ a\ file,\ the\ old\ version\ will\ be\ marked\ hidden
and\ still\ be\ available.\ \ Conversely,\ you\ may\ opt\ in\ to\ a\ "hard\ delete"
of\ files\ with\ the\ `\-\-b2\-hard\-delete`\ flag\ which\ would\ permanently\ remove
the\ file\ instead\ of\ hiding\ it.

Old\ versions\ of\ files,\ where\ available,\ are\ visible\ using\ the\ 
`\-\-b2\-versions`\ flag.

**NB**\ Note\ that\ `\-\-b2\-versions`\ does\ not\ work\ with\ crypt\ at\ the
moment\ [#1627](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1627).\ Using
[\-\-backup\-dir](/docs/#backup\-dir\-dir)\ with\ rclone\ is\ the\ recommended
way\ of\ working\ around\ this.

If\ you\ wish\ to\ remove\ all\ the\ old\ versions\ then\ you\ can\ use\ the
`rclone\ cleanup\ remote:bucket`\ command\ which\ will\ delete\ all\ the\ old
versions\ of\ files,\ leaving\ the\ current\ ones\ intact.\ \ You\ can\ also
supply\ a\ path\ and\ only\ old\ versions\ under\ that\ path\ will\ be\ deleted,
eg\ `rclone\ cleanup\ remote:bucket/path/to/stuff`.

Note\ that\ `cleanup`\ will\ remove\ partially\ uploaded\ files\ from\ the\ bucket
if\ they\ are\ more\ than\ a\ day\ old.

When\ you\ `purge`\ a\ bucket,\ the\ current\ and\ the\ old\ versions\ will\ be
deleted\ then\ the\ bucket\ will\ be\ deleted.

However\ `delete`\ will\ cause\ the\ current\ versions\ of\ the\ files\ to
become\ hidden\ old\ versions.

Here\ is\ a\ session\ showing\ the\ listing\ and\ retrieval\ of\ an\ old
version\ followed\ by\ a\ `cleanup`\ of\ the\ old\ versions.

###\ Data\ usage\ ###

It\ is\ useful\ to\ know\ how\ many\ requests\ are\ sent\ to\ the\ server\ in\ different\ scenarios.

All\ copy\ commands\ send\ the\ following\ 4\ requests:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
/b2api/v1/b2_authorize_account /b2api/v1/b2_create_bucket
/b2api/v1/b2_list_buckets /b2api/v1/b2_list_file_names
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

The\ `b2_list_file_names`\ request\ will\ be\ sent\ once\ for\ every\ 1k\ files
in\ the\ remote\ path,\ providing\ the\ checksum\ and\ modification\ time\ of
the\ listed\ files.\ As\ of\ version\ 1.33\ issue
[#818](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/818)\ causes\ extra\ requests
to\ be\ sent\ when\ using\ B2\ with\ Crypt.\ When\ a\ copy\ operation\ does\ not
require\ any\ files\ to\ be\ uploaded,\ no\ more\ requests\ will\ be\ sent.

Uploading\ files\ that\ do\ not\ require\ chunking,\ will\ send\ 2\ requests\ per
file\ upload:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
/b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_url /b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

Uploading\ files\ requiring\ chunking,\ will\ send\ 2\ requests\ (one\ each\ to
start\ and\ finish\ the\ upload)\ and\ another\ 2\ requests\ for\ each\ chunk:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
/b2api/v1/b2_start_large_file /b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_part_url

.IP
.nf
\f[C]

####\ Versions\ ####

Versions\ can\ be\ viewed\ with\ the\ `\-\-b2\-versions`\ flag.\ When\ it\ is\ set
rclone\ will\ show\ and\ act\ on\ older\ versions\ of\ files.\ \ For\ example

Listing\ without\ `\-\-b2\-versions`

be\ seen.\ \ These\ have\ the\ UTC\ date\ that\ they\ were\ uploaded\ to\ the
server\ to\ the\ nearest\ millisecond\ appended\ to\ them.

Note\ that\ when\ using\ `\-\-b2\-versions`\ no\ file\ write\ operations\ are
permitted,\ so\ you\ can\[aq]t\ upload\ files\ or\ delete\ them.

###\ B2\ and\ rclone\ link\ ###

Rclone\ supports\ generating\ file\ share\ links\ for\ private\ B2\ buckets.
They\ can\ either\ be\ for\ a\ file\ for\ example:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\&./rclone link B2:bucket/path/to/file.txt
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file.txt?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

or\ if\ run\ on\ a\ directory\ you\ will\ get:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\&./rclone link B2:bucket/path
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

you\ can\ then\ use\ the\ authorization\ token\ (the\ part\ of\ the\ url\ from\ the
\ `?Authorization=`\ on)\ on\ any\ file\ path\ under\ that\ directory.\ For\ example:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file1?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/file2?Authorization=xxxxxxxx

Box
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Paths\ are\ specified\ as\ `remote:path`

Paths\ may\ be\ as\ deep\ as\ required,\ eg\ `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

The\ initial\ setup\ for\ Box\ involves\ getting\ a\ token\ from\ Box\ which\ you
can\ do\ either\ in\ your\ browser,\ or\ with\ a\ config.json\ downloaded\ from\ Box
to\ use\ JWT\ authentication.\ \ `rclone\ config`\ walks\ you\ through\ it.

Here\ is\ an\ example\ of\ how\ to\ make\ a\ remote\ called\ `remote`.\ \ First\ run:

\ \ \ \ \ rclone\ config

This\ will\ guide\ you\ through\ an\ interactive\ setup\ process:

\[em]\[em]\[em]\[em]\[em]\[em]\[en] y) Yes this is OK e) Edit this
remote d) Delete this remote y/e/d> y
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

See\ the\ [remote\ setup\ docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/)\ for\ how\ to\ set\ it\ up\ on\ a
machine\ with\ no\ Internet\ browser\ available.

Note\ that\ rclone\ runs\ a\ webserver\ on\ your\ local\ machine\ to\ collect\ the
token\ as\ returned\ from\ Box.\ This\ only\ runs\ from\ the\ moment\ it\ opens
your\ browser\ to\ the\ moment\ you\ get\ back\ the\ verification\ code.\ \ This
is\ on\ `http://127.0.0.1:53682/`\ and\ this\ it\ may\ require\ you\ to\ unblock
it\ temporarily\ if\ you\ are\ running\ a\ host\ firewall.

Once\ configured\ you\ can\ then\ use\ `rclone`\ like\ this,

List\ directories\ in\ top\ level\ of\ your\ Box

\ \ \ \ rclone\ lsd\ remote:

List\ all\ the\ files\ in\ your\ Box

\ \ \ \ rclone\ ls\ remote:

To\ copy\ a\ local\ directory\ to\ an\ Box\ directory\ called\ backup

\ \ \ \ rclone\ copy\ /home/source\ remote:backup

###\ Using\ rclone\ with\ an\ Enterprise\ account\ with\ SSO\ ###

If\ you\ have\ an\ "Enterprise"\ account\ type\ with\ Box\ with\ single\ sign\ on
(SSO),\ you\ need\ to\ create\ a\ password\ to\ use\ Box\ with\ rclone.\ This\ can
be\ done\ at\ your\ Enterprise\ Box\ account\ by\ going\ to\ Settings,\ "Account"
Tab,\ and\ then\ set\ the\ password\ in\ the\ "Authentication"\ field.

Once\ you\ have\ done\ this,\ you\ can\ setup\ your\ Enterprise\ Box\ account
using\ the\ same\ procedure\ detailed\ above\ in\ the,\ using\ the\ password\ you
have\ just\ set.

###\ Invalid\ refresh\ token\ ###

According\ to\ the\ [box\ docs](https://developer.box.com/v2.0/docs/oauth\-20#section\-6\-using\-the\-access\-and\-refresh\-tokens):

>\ Each\ refresh_token\ is\ valid\ for\ one\ use\ in\ 60\ days.

This\ means\ that\ if\ you

\ \ *\ Don\[aq]t\ use\ the\ box\ remote\ for\ 60\ days
\ \ *\ Copy\ the\ config\ file\ with\ a\ box\ refresh\ token\ in\ and\ use\ it\ in\ two\ places
\ \ *\ Get\ an\ error\ on\ a\ token\ refresh

then\ rclone\ will\ return\ an\ error\ which\ includes\ the\ text\ `Invalid
refresh\ token`.

To\ fix\ this\ you\ will\ need\ to\ use\ oauth2\ again\ to\ update\ the\ refresh
token.\ \ You\ can\ use\ the\ methods\ in\ [the\ remote\ setup
docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/),\ bearing\ in\ mind\ that\ if\ you\ use\ the\ copy\ the
config\ file\ method,\ you\ should\ not\ use\ that\ remote\ on\ the\ computer\ you
did\ the\ authentication\ on.

Here\ is\ how\ to\ do\ it.

###\ Modified\ time\ and\ hashes\ ###

Box\ allows\ modification\ times\ to\ be\ set\ on\ objects\ accurate\ to\ 1
second.\ \ These\ will\ be\ used\ to\ detect\ whether\ objects\ need\ syncing\ or
not.

Box\ supports\ SHA1\ type\ hashes,\ so\ you\ can\ use\ the\ `\-\-checksum`
flag.

####\ Restricted\ filename\ characters

In\ addition\ to\ the\ [default\ restricted\ characters\ set](/overview/#restricted\-characters)
the\ following\ characters\ are\ also\ replaced:

|\ Character\ |\ Value\ |\ Replacement\ |
|\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |:\-\-\-\-\-:|:\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-:|
|\ \\\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ 0x5C\ \ |\ ＼\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |

File\ names\ can\ also\ not\ end\ with\ the\ following\ characters.
These\ only\ get\ replaced\ if\ they\ are\ last\ character\ in\ the\ name:

|\ Character\ |\ Value\ |\ Replacement\ |
|\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |:\-\-\-\-\-:|:\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-:|
|\ SP\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ 0x20\ \ |\ ␠\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |

Invalid\ UTF\-8\ bytes\ will\ also\ be\ [replaced](/overview/#invalid\-utf8),
as\ they\ can\[aq]t\ be\ used\ in\ JSON\ strings.

###\ Transfers\ ###

For\ files\ above\ 50MB\ rclone\ will\ use\ a\ chunked\ transfer.\ \ Rclone\ will
upload\ up\ to\ `\-\-transfers`\ chunks\ at\ the\ same\ time\ (shared\ among\ all
the\ multipart\ uploads).\ \ Chunks\ are\ buffered\ in\ memory\ and\ are
normally\ 8MB\ so\ increasing\ `\-\-transfers`\ will\ increase\ memory\ use.

###\ Deleting\ files\ ###

Depending\ on\ the\ enterprise\ settings\ for\ your\ user,\ the\ item\ will
either\ be\ actually\ deleted\ from\ Box\ or\ moved\ to\ the\ trash.

###\ Limitations\ ###

Note\ that\ Box\ is\ case\ insensitive\ so\ you\ can\[aq]t\ have\ a\ file\ called
"Hello.doc"\ and\ one\ called\ "hello.doc".

Box\ file\ names\ can\[aq]t\ have\ the\ `\\`\ character\ in.\ \ rclone\ maps\ this\ to
and\ from\ an\ identical\ looking\ unicode\ equivalent\ `＼`.

Box\ only\ supports\ filenames\ up\ to\ 255\ characters\ in\ length.

Cache\ (BETA)
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

The\ `cache`\ remote\ wraps\ another\ existing\ remote\ and\ stores\ file\ structure
and\ its\ data\ for\ long\ running\ tasks\ like\ `rclone\ mount`.

To\ get\ started\ you\ just\ need\ to\ have\ an\ existing\ remote\ which\ can\ be\ configured
with\ `cache`.

Here\ is\ an\ example\ of\ how\ to\ make\ a\ remote\ called\ `test\-cache`.\ \ First\ run:

\ \ \ \ \ rclone\ config

###\ Write\ Features\ ###

###\ Offline\ uploading\ ###

In\ an\ effort\ to\ make\ writing\ through\ cache\ more\ reliable,\ the\ backend\ 
now\ supports\ this\ feature\ which\ can\ be\ activated\ by\ specifying\ a
`cache\-tmp\-upload\-path`.

A\ files\ goes\ through\ these\ states\ when\ using\ this\ feature:

1.\ An\ upload\ is\ started\ (usually\ by\ copying\ a\ file\ on\ the\ cache\ remote)
2.\ When\ the\ copy\ to\ the\ temporary\ location\ is\ complete\ the\ file\ is\ part\ 
of\ the\ cached\ remote\ and\ looks\ and\ behaves\ like\ any\ other\ file\ (reading\ included)
3.\ After\ `cache\-tmp\-wait\-time`\ passes\ and\ the\ file\ is\ next\ in\ line,\ `rclone\ move`\ 
is\ used\ to\ move\ the\ file\ to\ the\ cloud\ provider
4.\ Reading\ the\ file\ still\ works\ during\ the\ upload\ but\ most\ modifications\ on\ it\ will\ be\ prohibited
5.\ Once\ the\ move\ is\ complete\ the\ file\ is\ unlocked\ for\ modifications\ as\ it
becomes\ as\ any\ other\ regular\ file
6.\ If\ the\ file\ is\ being\ read\ through\ `cache`\ when\ it\[aq]s\ actually
deleted\ from\ the\ temporary\ path\ then\ `cache`\ will\ simply\ swap\ the\ source
to\ the\ cloud\ provider\ without\ interrupting\ the\ reading\ (small\ blip\ can\ happen\ though)

Files\ are\ uploaded\ in\ sequence\ and\ only\ one\ file\ is\ uploaded\ at\ a\ time.
Uploads\ will\ be\ stored\ in\ a\ queue\ and\ be\ processed\ based\ on\ the\ order\ they\ were\ added.
The\ queue\ and\ the\ temporary\ storage\ is\ persistent\ across\ restarts\ but
can\ be\ cleared\ on\ startup\ with\ the\ `\-\-cache\-db\-purge`\ flag.

###\ Write\ Support\ ###

Writes\ are\ supported\ through\ `cache`.
One\ caveat\ is\ that\ a\ mounted\ cache\ remote\ does\ not\ add\ any\ retry\ or\ fallback
mechanism\ to\ the\ upload\ operation.\ This\ will\ depend\ on\ the\ implementation
of\ the\ wrapped\ remote.\ Consider\ using\ `Offline\ uploading`\ for\ reliable\ writes.

One\ special\ case\ is\ covered\ with\ `cache\-writes`\ which\ will\ cache\ the\ file
data\ at\ the\ same\ time\ as\ the\ upload\ when\ it\ is\ enabled\ making\ it\ available
from\ the\ cache\ store\ immediately\ once\ the\ upload\ is\ finished.

###\ Read\ Features\ ###

####\ Multiple\ connections\ ####

To\ counter\ the\ high\ latency\ between\ a\ local\ PC\ where\ rclone\ is\ running
and\ cloud\ providers,\ the\ cache\ remote\ can\ split\ multiple\ requests\ to\ the
cloud\ provider\ for\ smaller\ file\ chunks\ and\ combines\ them\ together\ locally
where\ they\ can\ be\ available\ almost\ immediately\ before\ the\ reader\ usually
needs\ them.

This\ is\ similar\ to\ buffering\ when\ media\ files\ are\ played\ online.\ Rclone
will\ stay\ around\ the\ current\ marker\ but\ always\ try\ its\ best\ to\ stay\ ahead
and\ prepare\ the\ data\ before.

####\ Plex\ Integration\ ####

There\ is\ a\ direct\ integration\ with\ Plex\ which\ allows\ cache\ to\ detect\ during\ reading
if\ the\ file\ is\ in\ playback\ or\ not.\ This\ helps\ cache\ to\ adapt\ how\ it\ queries
the\ cloud\ provider\ depending\ on\ what\ is\ needed\ for.

Scans\ will\ have\ a\ minimum\ amount\ of\ workers\ (1)\ while\ in\ a\ confirmed\ playback\ cache
will\ deploy\ the\ configured\ number\ of\ workers.

This\ integration\ opens\ the\ doorway\ to\ additional\ performance\ improvements
which\ will\ be\ explored\ in\ the\ near\ future.

**Note:**\ If\ Plex\ options\ are\ not\ configured,\ `cache`\ will\ function\ with\ its
configured\ options\ without\ adapting\ any\ of\ its\ settings.

How\ to\ enable?\ Run\ `rclone\ config`\ and\ add\ all\ the\ Plex\ options\ (endpoint,\ username
and\ password)\ in\ your\ remote\ and\ it\ will\ be\ automatically\ enabled.

Affected\ settings:
\-\ `cache\-workers`:\ _Configured\ value_\ during\ confirmed\ playback\ or\ _1_\ all\ the\ other\ times

#####\ Certificate\ Validation\ #####

When\ the\ Plex\ server\ is\ configured\ to\ only\ accept\ secure\ connections,\ it\ is
possible\ to\ use\ `.plex.direct`\ URL\[aq]s\ to\ ensure\ certificate\ validation\ succeeds.
These\ URL\[aq]s\ are\ used\ by\ Plex\ internally\ to\ connect\ to\ the\ Plex\ server\ securely.

The\ format\ for\ this\ URL\[aq]s\ is\ the\ following:

https://ip\-with\-dots\-replaced.server\-hash.plex.direct:32400/

The\ `ip\-with\-dots\-replaced`\ part\ can\ be\ any\ IPv4\ address,\ where\ the\ dots
have\ been\ replaced\ with\ dashes,\ e.g.\ `127.0.0.1`\ becomes\ `127\-0\-0\-1`.

To\ get\ the\ `server\-hash`\ part,\ the\ easiest\ way\ is\ to\ visit

https://plex.tv/api/resources?includeHttps=1&X\-Plex\-Token=your\-plex\-token

This\ page\ will\ list\ all\ the\ available\ Plex\ servers\ for\ your\ account
with\ at\ least\ one\ `.plex.direct`\ link\ for\ each.\ Copy\ one\ URL\ and\ replace
the\ IP\ address\ with\ the\ desired\ address.\ This\ can\ be\ used\ as\ the
`plex_url`\ value.

###\ Known\ issues\ ###

####\ Mount\ and\ \-\-dir\-cache\-time\ ####

\-\-dir\-cache\-time\ controls\ the\ first\ layer\ of\ directory\ caching\ which\ works\ at\ the\ mount\ layer.
Being\ an\ independent\ caching\ mechanism\ from\ the\ `cache`\ backend,\ it\ will\ manage\ its\ own\ entries
based\ on\ the\ configured\ time.

To\ avoid\ getting\ in\ a\ scenario\ where\ dir\ cache\ has\ obsolete\ data\ and\ cache\ would\ have\ the\ correct
one,\ try\ to\ set\ `\-\-dir\-cache\-time`\ to\ a\ lower\ time\ than\ `\-\-cache\-info\-age`.\ Default\ values\ are
already\ configured\ in\ this\ way.\ 

####\ Windows\ support\ \-\ Experimental\ ####

There\ are\ a\ couple\ of\ issues\ with\ Windows\ `mount`\ functionality\ that\ still\ require\ some\ investigations.
It\ should\ be\ considered\ as\ experimental\ thus\ far\ as\ fixes\ come\ in\ for\ this\ OS.

Most\ of\ the\ issues\ seem\ to\ be\ related\ to\ the\ difference\ between\ filesystems
on\ Linux\ flavors\ and\ Windows\ as\ cache\ is\ heavily\ dependant\ on\ them.

Any\ reports\ or\ feedback\ on\ how\ cache\ behaves\ on\ this\ OS\ is\ greatly\ appreciated.

####\ Risk\ of\ throttling\ ####

Future\ iterations\ of\ the\ cache\ backend\ will\ make\ use\ of\ the\ pooling\ functionality
of\ the\ cloud\ provider\ to\ synchronize\ and\ at\ the\ same\ time\ make\ writing\ through\ it
more\ tolerant\ to\ failures.\ 

There\ are\ a\ couple\ of\ enhancements\ in\ track\ to\ add\ these\ but\ in\ the\ meantime
there\ is\ a\ valid\ concern\ that\ the\ expiring\ cache\ listings\ can\ lead\ to\ cloud\ provider
throttles\ or\ bans\ due\ to\ repeated\ queries\ on\ it\ for\ very\ large\ mounts.

Some\ recommendations:
\-\ don\[aq]t\ use\ a\ very\ small\ interval\ for\ entry\ informations\ (`\-\-cache\-info\-age`)
\-\ while\ writes\ aren\[aq]t\ yet\ optimised,\ you\ can\ still\ write\ through\ `cache`\ which\ gives\ you\ the\ advantage
of\ adding\ the\ file\ in\ the\ cache\ at\ the\ same\ time\ if\ configured\ to\ do\ so.

Future\ enhancements:

####\ cache\ and\ crypt\ ####

One\ common\ scenario\ is\ to\ keep\ your\ data\ encrypted\ in\ the\ cloud\ provider
using\ the\ `crypt`\ remote.\ `crypt`\ uses\ a\ similar\ technique\ to\ wrap\ around
an\ existing\ remote\ and\ handles\ this\ translation\ in\ a\ seamless\ way.

There\ is\ an\ issue\ with\ wrapping\ the\ remotes\ in\ this\ order:
<span\ style="color:red">**cloud\ remote**\ \->\ **crypt**\ \->\ **cache**</span>

During\ testing,\ I\ experienced\ a\ lot\ of\ bans\ with\ the\ remotes\ in\ this\ order.
I\ suspect\ it\ might\ be\ related\ to\ how\ crypt\ opens\ files\ on\ the\ cloud\ provider
which\ makes\ it\ think\ we\[aq]re\ downloading\ the\ full\ file\ instead\ of\ small\ chunks.
Organizing\ the\ remotes\ in\ this\ order\ yields\ better\ results:
<span\ style="color:green">**cloud\ remote**\ \->\ **cache**\ \->\ **crypt**</span>

####\ absolute\ remote\ paths\ ####

`cache`\ can\ not\ differentiate\ between\ relative\ and\ absolute\ paths\ for\ the\ wrapped\ remote.
Any\ path\ given\ in\ the\ `remote`\ config\ setting\ and\ on\ the\ command\ line\ will\ be\ passed\ to
the\ wrapped\ remote\ as\ is,\ but\ for\ storing\ the\ chunks\ on\ disk\ the\ path\ will\ be\ made
relative\ by\ removing\ any\ leading\ `/`\ character.

This\ behavior\ is\ irrelevant\ for\ most\ backend\ types,\ but\ there\ are\ backends\ where\ a\ leading\ `/`
changes\ the\ effective\ directory,\ e.g.\ in\ the\ `sftp`\ backend\ paths\ starting\ with\ a\ `/`\ are
relative\ to\ the\ root\ of\ the\ SSH\ server\ and\ paths\ without\ are\ relative\ to\ the\ user\ home\ directory.
As\ a\ result\ `sftp:bin`\ and\ `sftp:/bin`\ will\ share\ the\ same\ cache\ folder,\ even\ if\ they\ represent
a\ different\ directory\ on\ the\ SSH\ server.

###\ Cache\ and\ Remote\ Control\ (\-\-rc)\ ###
Cache\ supports\ the\ new\ `\-\-rc`\ mode\ in\ rclone\ and\ can\ be\ remote\ controlled\ through\ the\ following\ end\ points:
By\ default,\ the\ listener\ is\ disabled\ if\ you\ do\ not\ add\ the\ flag.

###\ rc\ cache/expire
Purge\ a\ remote\ from\ the\ cache\ backend.\ Supports\ either\ a\ directory\ or\ a\ file.
It\ supports\ both\ encrypted\ and\ unencrypted\ file\ names\ if\ cache\ is\ wrapped\ by\ crypt.

Params:
\ \ \-\ **remote**\ =\ path\ to\ remote\ **(required)**
\ \ \-\ **withData**\ =\ true/false\ to\ delete\ cached\ data\ (chunks)\ as\ well\ _(optional,\ false\ by\ default)_

####\ \-\-cache\-chunk\-size

The\ size\ of\ a\ chunk\ (partial\ file\ data).

Use\ lower\ numbers\ for\ slower\ connections.\ If\ the\ chunk\ size\ is
changed,\ any\ downloaded\ chunks\ will\ be\ invalid\ and\ cache\-chunk\-path
will\ need\ to\ be\ cleared\ or\ unexpected\ EOF\ errors\ will\ occur.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ chunk_size
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_SIZE
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ SizeSuffix
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ 5M
\-\ Examples:

\ \ \ \ \-\ "5M"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ 5\ MB
\ \ \ \ \-\ "10M"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ 10\ MB

####\ \-\-cache\-info\-age

How\ long\ to\ cache\ file\ structure\ information\ (directory\ listings,\ file\ size,\ times\ etc).\ 
If\ all\ write\ operations\ are\ done\ through\ the\ cache\ then\ you\ can\ safely\ make
this\ value\ very\ large\ as\ the\ cache\ store\ will\ also\ be\ updated\ in\ real\ time.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ info_age

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ 48\ hours

####\ \-\-cache\-chunk\-total\-size

The\ total\ size\ that\ the\ chunks\ can\ take\ up\ on\ the\ local\ disk.

If\ the\ cache\ exceeds\ this\ value\ then\ it\ will\ start\ to\ delete\ the
oldest\ chunks\ until\ it\ goes\ under\ this\ value.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ chunk_total_size
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_TOTAL_SIZE

\ \ \ \ \-\ "10G"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ 10\ GB

###\ Advanced\ Options

Here\ are\ the\ advanced\ options\ specific\ to\ cache\ (Cache\ a\ remote).

####\ \-\-cache\-plex\-token

The\ plex\ token\ for\ authentication\ \-\ auto\ set\ normally

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ plex_token
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_TOKEN
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ string
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ ""

####\ \-\-cache\-plex\-insecure

Skip\ all\ certificate\ verifications\ when\ connecting\ to\ the\ Plex\ server

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ plex_insecure
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_INSECURE
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ string
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ ""

####\ \-\-cache\-db\-path

Directory\ to\ store\ file\ structure\ metadata\ DB.
The\ remote\ name\ is\ used\ as\ the\ DB\ file\ name.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ db_path
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_DB_PATH
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ string
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ "$HOME/.cache/rclone/cache\-backend"

####\ \-\-cache\-chunk\-path

Directory\ to\ cache\ chunk\ files.

Path\ to\ where\ partial\ file\ data\ (chunks)\ are\ stored\ locally.\ The\ remote
name\ is\ appended\ to\ the\ final\ path.

This\ config\ follows\ the\ "\-\-cache\-db\-path".\ If\ you\ specify\ a\ custom
location\ for\ "\-\-cache\-db\-path"\ and\ don\[aq]t\ specify\ one\ for\ "\-\-cache\-chunk\-path"
then\ "\-\-cache\-chunk\-path"\ will\ use\ the\ same\ path\ as\ "\-\-cache\-db\-path".

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ chunk_path
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_PATH
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ string
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ "$HOME/.cache/rclone/cache\-backend"

####\ \-\-cache\-db\-purge

Clear\ all\ the\ cached\ data\ for\ this\ remote\ on\ start.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ db_purge
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_DB_PURGE
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ bool
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ false

####\ \-\-cache\-chunk\-clean\-interval

How\ often\ should\ the\ cache\ perform\ cleanups\ of\ the\ chunk\ storage.
The\ default\ value\ should\ be\ ok\ for\ most\ people.\ If\ you\ find\ that\ the
cache\ goes\ over\ "cache\-chunk\-total\-size"\ too\ often\ then\ try\ to\ lower
this\ value\ to\ force\ it\ to\ perform\ cleanups\ more\ often.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ chunk_clean_interval
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_CLEAN_INTERVAL
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Duration
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ 1m0s

####\ \-\-cache\-read\-retries

How\ many\ times\ to\ retry\ a\ read\ from\ a\ cache\ storage.

Since\ reading\ from\ a\ cache\ stream\ is\ independent\ from\ downloading\ file
data,\ readers\ can\ get\ to\ a\ point\ where\ there\[aq]s\ no\ more\ data\ in\ the
cache.\ \ Most\ of\ the\ times\ this\ can\ indicate\ a\ connectivity\ issue\ if
cache\ isn\[aq]t\ able\ to\ provide\ file\ data\ anymore.

For\ really\ slow\ connections,\ increase\ this\ to\ a\ point\ where\ the\ stream\ is
able\ to\ provide\ data\ but\ your\ experience\ will\ be\ very\ stuttering.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ read_retries
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_READ_RETRIES
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ int
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ 10

####\ \-\-cache\-workers

How\ many\ workers\ should\ run\ in\ parallel\ to\ download\ chunks.

Higher\ values\ will\ mean\ more\ parallel\ processing\ (better\ CPU\ needed)
and\ more\ concurrent\ requests\ on\ the\ cloud\ provider.\ \ This\ impacts
several\ aspects\ like\ the\ cloud\ provider\ API\ limits,\ more\ stress\ on\ the
hardware\ that\ rclone\ runs\ on\ but\ it\ also\ means\ that\ streams\ will\ be
more\ fluid\ and\ data\ will\ be\ available\ much\ more\ faster\ to\ readers.

**Note**:\ If\ the\ optional\ Plex\ integration\ is\ enabled\ then\ this
setting\ will\ adapt\ to\ the\ type\ of\ reading\ performed\ and\ the\ value
specified\ here\ will\ be\ used\ as\ a\ maximum\ number\ of\ workers\ to\ use.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ workers
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_WORKERS
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ int
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ 4

####\ \-\-cache\-chunk\-no\-memory

Disable\ the\ in\-memory\ cache\ for\ storing\ chunks\ during\ streaming.

By\ default,\ cache\ will\ keep\ file\ data\ during\ streaming\ in\ RAM\ as\ well
to\ provide\ it\ to\ readers\ as\ fast\ as\ possible.

This\ transient\ data\ is\ evicted\ as\ soon\ as\ it\ is\ read\ and\ the\ number\ of
chunks\ stored\ doesn\[aq]t\ exceed\ the\ number\ of\ workers.\ However,\ depending
on\ other\ settings\ like\ "cache\-chunk\-size"\ and\ "cache\-workers"\ this\ footprint
can\ increase\ if\ there\ are\ parallel\ streams\ too\ (multiple\ files\ being\ read
at\ the\ same\ time).

If\ the\ hardware\ permits\ it,\ use\ this\ feature\ to\ provide\ an\ overall\ better
performance\ during\ streaming\ but\ it\ can\ also\ be\ disabled\ if\ RAM\ is\ not
available\ on\ the\ local\ machine.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ chunk_no_memory
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_NO_MEMORY
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ bool
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ false

####\ \-\-cache\-rps

Limits\ the\ number\ of\ requests\ per\ second\ to\ the\ source\ FS\ (\-1\ to\ disable)

This\ setting\ places\ a\ hard\ limit\ on\ the\ number\ of\ requests\ per\ second
that\ cache\ will\ be\ doing\ to\ the\ cloud\ provider\ remote\ and\ try\ to
respect\ that\ value\ by\ setting\ waits\ between\ reads.

If\ you\ find\ that\ you\[aq]re\ getting\ banned\ or\ limited\ on\ the\ cloud
provider\ through\ cache\ and\ know\ that\ a\ smaller\ number\ of\ requests\ per
second\ will\ allow\ you\ to\ work\ with\ it\ then\ you\ can\ use\ this\ setting
for\ that.

A\ good\ balance\ of\ all\ the\ other\ settings\ should\ make\ this\ setting
useless\ but\ it\ is\ available\ to\ set\ for\ more\ special\ cases.

**NOTE**:\ This\ will\ limit\ the\ number\ of\ requests\ during\ streams\ but
other\ API\ calls\ to\ the\ cloud\ provider\ like\ directory\ listings\ will
still\ pass.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ rps
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_RPS
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ int
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ \-1

####\ \-\-cache\-writes

Cache\ file\ data\ on\ writes\ through\ the\ FS

If\ you\ need\ to\ read\ files\ immediately\ after\ you\ upload\ them\ through
cache\ you\ can\ enable\ this\ flag\ to\ have\ their\ data\ stored\ in\ the
cache\ store\ at\ the\ same\ time\ during\ upload.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ writes
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_WRITES
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ bool
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ false

####\ \-\-cache\-tmp\-upload\-path

Directory\ to\ keep\ temporary\ files\ until\ they\ are\ uploaded.

This\ is\ the\ path\ where\ cache\ will\ use\ as\ a\ temporary\ storage\ for\ new
files\ that\ need\ to\ be\ uploaded\ to\ the\ cloud\ provider.

Specifying\ a\ value\ will\ enable\ this\ feature.\ Without\ it,\ it\ is
completely\ disabled\ and\ files\ will\ be\ uploaded\ directly\ to\ the\ cloud
provider

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ tmp_upload_path
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_TMP_UPLOAD_PATH
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ string
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ ""

####\ \-\-cache\-tmp\-wait\-time

How\ long\ should\ files\ be\ stored\ in\ local\ cache\ before\ being\ uploaded

This\ is\ the\ duration\ that\ a\ file\ must\ wait\ in\ the\ temporary\ location
_cache\-tmp\-upload\-path_\ before\ it\ is\ selected\ for\ upload.

Note\ that\ only\ one\ file\ is\ uploaded\ at\ a\ time\ and\ it\ can\ take\ longer
to\ start\ the\ upload\ if\ a\ queue\ formed\ for\ this\ purpose.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ tmp_wait_time
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_TMP_WAIT_TIME
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Duration
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ 15s

####\ \-\-cache\-db\-wait\-time

How\ long\ to\ wait\ for\ the\ DB\ to\ be\ available\ \-\ 0\ is\ unlimited

Only\ one\ process\ can\ have\ the\ DB\ open\ at\ any\ one\ time,\ so\ rclone\ waits
for\ this\ duration\ for\ the\ DB\ to\ become\ available\ before\ it\ gives\ an
error.

If\ you\ set\ it\ to\ 0\ then\ it\ will\ wait\ forever.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ db_wait_time
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CACHE_DB_WAIT_TIME
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Duration
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ 1s

Chunker\ (BETA)
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

The\ `chunker`\ overlay\ transparently\ splits\ large\ files\ into\ smaller\ chunks
during\ upload\ to\ wrapped\ remote\ and\ transparently\ assembles\ them\ back
when\ the\ file\ is\ downloaded.\ This\ allows\ to\ effectively\ overcome\ size\ limits
imposed\ by\ storage\ providers.

To\ use\ it,\ first\ set\ up\ the\ underlying\ remote\ following\ the\ configuration
instructions\ for\ that\ remote.\ You\ can\ also\ use\ a\ local\ pathname\ instead\ of
a\ remote.

First\ check\ your\ chosen\ remote\ is\ working\ \-\ we\[aq]ll\ call\ it\ `remote:path`\ here.
Note\ that\ anything\ inside\ `remote:path`\ will\ be\ chunked\ and\ anything\ outside
won\[aq]t.\ This\ means\ that\ if\ you\ are\ using\ a\ bucket\ based\ remote\ (eg\ S3,\ B2,\ swift)
then\ you\ should\ probably\ put\ the\ bucket\ in\ the\ remote\ `s3:bucket`.

Now\ configure\ `chunker`\ using\ `rclone\ config`.\ We\ will\ call\ this\ one\ `overlay`
to\ separate\ it\ from\ the\ `remote`\ itself.

###\ Specifying\ the\ remote

In\ normal\ use,\ make\ sure\ the\ remote\ has\ a\ `:`\ in.\ If\ you\ specify\ the\ remote
without\ a\ `:`\ then\ rclone\ will\ use\ a\ local\ directory\ of\ that\ name.
So\ if\ you\ use\ a\ remote\ of\ `/path/to/secret/files`\ then\ rclone\ will
chunk\ stuff\ in\ that\ directory.\ If\ you\ use\ a\ remote\ of\ `name`\ then\ rclone
will\ put\ files\ in\ a\ directory\ called\ `name`\ in\ the\ current\ directory.


###\ Chunking

When\ rclone\ starts\ a\ file\ upload,\ chunker\ checks\ the\ file\ size.\ If\ it
doesn\[aq]t\ exceed\ the\ configured\ chunk\ size,\ chunker\ will\ just\ pass\ the\ file
to\ the\ wrapped\ remote.\ If\ a\ file\ is\ large,\ chunker\ will\ transparently\ cut
data\ in\ pieces\ with\ temporary\ names\ and\ stream\ them\ one\ by\ one,\ on\ the\ fly.
Each\ data\ chunk\ will\ contain\ the\ specified\ number\ of\ bytes,\ except\ for\ the
last\ one\ which\ may\ have\ less\ data.\ If\ file\ size\ is\ unknown\ in\ advance
(this\ is\ called\ a\ streaming\ upload),\ chunker\ will\ internally\ create
a\ temporary\ copy,\ record\ its\ size\ and\ repeat\ the\ above\ process.

When\ upload\ completes,\ temporary\ chunk\ files\ are\ finally\ renamed.
This\ scheme\ guarantees\ that\ operations\ can\ be\ run\ in\ parallel\ and\ look
from\ outside\ as\ atomic.
A\ similar\ method\ with\ hidden\ temporary\ chunks\ is\ used\ for\ other\ operations
(copy/move/rename\ etc).\ If\ an\ operation\ fails,\ hidden\ chunks\ are\ normally
destroyed,\ and\ the\ target\ composite\ file\ stays\ intact.

When\ a\ composite\ file\ download\ is\ requested,\ chunker\ transparently
assembles\ it\ by\ concatenating\ data\ chunks\ in\ order.\ As\ the\ split\ is\ trivial
one\ could\ even\ manually\ concatenate\ data\ chunks\ together\ to\ obtain\ the
original\ content.

When\ the\ `list`\ rclone\ command\ scans\ a\ directory\ on\ wrapped\ remote,
the\ potential\ chunk\ files\ are\ accounted\ for,\ grouped\ and\ assembled\ into
composite\ directory\ entries.\ Any\ temporary\ chunks\ are\ hidden.

List\ and\ other\ commands\ can\ sometimes\ come\ across\ composite\ files\ with
missing\ or\ invalid\ chunks,\ eg.\ shadowed\ by\ like\-named\ directory\ or
another\ file.\ This\ usually\ means\ that\ wrapped\ file\ system\ has\ been\ directly
tampered\ with\ or\ damaged.\ If\ chunker\ detects\ a\ missing\ chunk\ it\ will
by\ default\ print\ warning,\ skip\ the\ whole\ incomplete\ group\ of\ chunks\ but
proceed\ with\ current\ command.
You\ can\ set\ the\ `\-\-chunker\-fail\-hard`\ flag\ to\ have\ commands\ abort\ with
error\ message\ in\ such\ cases.


####\ Chunk\ names

The\ default\ chunk\ name\ format\ is\ `*.rclone\-chunk.###`,\ hence\ by\ default
chunk\ names\ are\ `BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone\-chunk.001`,
`BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone\-chunk.002`\ etc.\ You\ can\ configure\ a\ different\ name
format\ using\ the\ `\-\-chunker\-name\-format`\ option.\ The\ format\ uses\ asterisk
`*`\ as\ a\ placeholder\ for\ the\ base\ file\ name\ and\ one\ or\ more\ consecutive
hash\ characters\ `#`\ as\ a\ placeholder\ for\ sequential\ chunk\ number.
There\ must\ be\ one\ and\ only\ one\ asterisk.\ The\ number\ of\ consecutive\ hash
characters\ defines\ the\ minimum\ length\ of\ a\ string\ representing\ a\ chunk\ number.
If\ decimal\ chunk\ number\ has\ less\ digits\ than\ the\ number\ of\ hashes,\ it\ is
left\-padded\ by\ zeros.\ If\ the\ decimal\ string\ is\ longer,\ it\ is\ left\ intact.
By\ default\ numbering\ starts\ from\ 1\ but\ there\ is\ another\ option\ that\ allows
user\ to\ start\ from\ 0,\ eg.\ for\ compatibility\ with\ legacy\ software.

For\ example,\ if\ name\ format\ is\ `big_*\-##.part`\ and\ original\ file\ name\ is
`data.txt`\ and\ numbering\ starts\ from\ 0,\ then\ the\ first\ chunk\ will\ be\ named
`big_data.txt\-00.part`,\ the\ 99th\ chunk\ will\ be\ `big_data.txt\-98.part`
and\ the\ 302nd\ chunk\ will\ become\ `big_data.txt\-301.part`.

Note\ that\ `list`\ assembles\ composite\ directory\ entries\ only\ when\ chunk\ names
match\ the\ configured\ format\ and\ treats\ non\-conforming\ file\ names\ as\ normal
non\-chunked\ files.


###\ Metadata

Besides\ data\ chunks\ chunker\ will\ by\ default\ create\ metadata\ object\ for
a\ composite\ file.\ The\ object\ is\ named\ after\ the\ original\ file.
Chunker\ allows\ user\ to\ disable\ metadata\ completely\ (the\ `none`\ format).
Note\ that\ metadata\ is\ normally\ not\ created\ for\ files\ smaller\ than\ the
configured\ chunk\ size.\ This\ may\ change\ in\ future\ rclone\ releases.

####\ Simple\ JSON\ metadata\ format

This\ is\ the\ default\ format.\ It\ supports\ hash\ sums\ and\ chunk\ validation
for\ composite\ files.\ Meta\ objects\ carry\ the\ following\ fields:

\-\ `ver`\ \ \ \ \ \-\ version\ of\ format,\ currently\ `1`
\-\ `size`\ \ \ \ \-\ total\ size\ of\ composite\ file
\-\ `nchunks`\ \-\ number\ of\ data\ chunks\ in\ file
\-\ `md5`\ \ \ \ \ \-\ MD5\ hashsum\ of\ composite\ file\ (if\ present)
\-\ `sha1`\ \ \ \ \-\ SHA1\ hashsum\ (if\ present)

There\ is\ no\ field\ for\ composite\ file\ name\ as\ it\[aq]s\ simply\ equal\ to\ the\ name
of\ meta\ object\ on\ the\ wrapped\ remote.\ Please\ refer\ to\ respective\ sections
for\ details\ on\ hashsums\ and\ modified\ time\ handling.

####\ No\ metadata

You\ can\ disable\ meta\ objects\ by\ setting\ the\ meta\ format\ option\ to\ `none`.
In\ this\ mode\ chunker\ will\ scan\ directory\ for\ all\ files\ that\ follow
configured\ chunk\ name\ format,\ group\ them\ by\ detecting\ chunks\ with\ the\ same
base\ name\ and\ show\ group\ names\ as\ virtual\ composite\ files.
This\ method\ is\ more\ prone\ to\ missing\ chunk\ errors\ (especially\ missing
last\ chunk)\ than\ format\ with\ metadata\ enabled.


###\ Hashsums

Chunker\ supports\ hashsums\ only\ when\ a\ compatible\ metadata\ is\ present.
Hence,\ if\ you\ choose\ metadata\ format\ of\ `none`,\ chunker\ will\ report\ hashsum
as\ `UNSUPPORTED`.

Please\ note\ that\ by\ default\ metadata\ is\ stored\ only\ for\ composite\ files.
If\ a\ file\ is\ smaller\ than\ configured\ chunk\ size,\ chunker\ will\ transparently
redirect\ hash\ requests\ to\ wrapped\ remote,\ so\ support\ depends\ on\ that.
You\ will\ see\ the\ empty\ string\ as\ a\ hashsum\ of\ requested\ type\ for\ small
files\ if\ the\ wrapped\ remote\ doesn\[aq]t\ support\ it.

Many\ storage\ backends\ support\ MD5\ and\ SHA1\ hash\ types,\ so\ does\ chunker.
With\ chunker\ you\ can\ choose\ one\ or\ another\ but\ not\ both.
MD5\ is\ set\ by\ default\ as\ the\ most\ supported\ type.
Since\ chunker\ keeps\ hashes\ for\ composite\ files\ and\ falls\ back\ to\ the
wrapped\ remote\ hash\ for\ non\-chunked\ ones,\ we\ advise\ you\ to\ choose\ the\ same
hash\ type\ as\ supported\ by\ wrapped\ remote\ so\ that\ your\ file\ listings
look\ coherent.

If\ your\ storage\ backend\ does\ not\ support\ MD5\ or\ SHA1\ but\ you\ need\ consistent
file\ hashing,\ configure\ chunker\ with\ `md5all`\ or\ `sha1all`.\ These\ two\ modes
guarantee\ given\ hash\ for\ all\ files.\ If\ wrapped\ remote\ doesn\[aq]t\ support\ it,
chunker\ will\ then\ add\ metadata\ to\ all\ files,\ even\ small.\ However,\ this\ can
double\ the\ amount\ of\ small\ files\ in\ storage\ and\ incur\ additional\ service\ charges.

Normally,\ when\ a\ file\ is\ copied\ to\ chunker\ controlled\ remote,\ chunker
will\ ask\ the\ file\ source\ for\ compatible\ file\ hash\ and\ revert\ to\ on\-the\-fly
calculation\ if\ none\ is\ found.\ This\ involves\ some\ CPU\ overhead\ but\ provides
a\ guarantee\ that\ given\ hashsum\ is\ available.\ Also,\ chunker\ will\ reject
a\ server\-side\ copy\ or\ move\ operation\ if\ source\ and\ destination\ hashsum
types\ are\ different\ resulting\ in\ the\ extra\ network\ bandwidth,\ too.
In\ some\ rare\ cases\ this\ may\ be\ undesired,\ so\ chunker\ provides\ two\ optional
choices:\ `sha1quick`\ and\ `md5quick`.\ If\ the\ source\ does\ not\ support\ primary
hash\ type\ and\ the\ quick\ mode\ is\ enabled,\ chunker\ will\ try\ to\ fall\ back\ to
the\ secondary\ type.\ This\ will\ save\ CPU\ and\ bandwidth\ but\ can\ result\ in\ empty
hashsums\ at\ destination.\ Beware\ of\ consequences:\ the\ `sync`\ command\ will
revert\ (sometimes\ silently)\ to\ time/size\ comparison\ if\ compatible\ hashsums
between\ source\ and\ target\ are\ not\ found.


###\ Modified\ time

Chunker\ stores\ modification\ times\ using\ the\ wrapped\ remote\ so\ support
depends\ on\ that.\ For\ a\ small\ non\-chunked\ file\ the\ chunker\ overlay\ simply
manipulates\ modification\ time\ of\ the\ wrapped\ remote\ file.
For\ a\ composite\ file\ with\ metadata\ chunker\ will\ get\ and\ set
modification\ time\ of\ the\ metadata\ object\ on\ the\ wrapped\ remote.
If\ file\ is\ chunked\ but\ metadata\ format\ is\ `none`\ then\ chunker\ will
use\ modification\ time\ of\ the\ first\ data\ chunk.


###\ Migrations

The\ idiomatic\ way\ to\ migrate\ to\ a\ different\ chunk\ size,\ hash\ type\ or
chunk\ naming\ scheme\ is\ to:

\-\ Collect\ all\ your\ chunked\ files\ under\ a\ directory\ and\ have\ your
\ \ chunker\ remote\ point\ to\ it.
\-\ Create\ another\ directory\ (most\ probably\ on\ the\ same\ cloud\ storage)
\ \ and\ configure\ a\ new\ remote\ with\ desired\ metadata\ format,
\ \ hash\ type,\ chunk\ naming\ etc.
\-\ Now\ run\ `rclone\ sync\ oldchunks:\ newchunks:`\ and\ all\ your\ data
\ \ will\ be\ transparently\ converted\ in\ transfer.
\ \ This\ may\ take\ some\ time,\ yet\ chunker\ will\ try\ server\-side
\ \ copy\ if\ possible.
\-\ After\ checking\ data\ integrity\ you\ may\ remove\ configuration\ section
\ \ of\ the\ old\ remote.

If\ rclone\ gets\ killed\ during\ a\ long\ operation\ on\ a\ big\ composite\ file,
hidden\ temporary\ chunks\ may\ stay\ in\ the\ directory.\ They\ will\ not\ be
shown\ by\ the\ `list`\ command\ but\ will\ eat\ up\ your\ account\ quota.
Please\ note\ that\ the\ `deletefile`\ command\ deletes\ only\ active
chunks\ of\ a\ file.\ As\ a\ workaround,\ you\ can\ use\ remote\ of\ the\ wrapped
file\ system\ to\ see\ them.
An\ easy\ way\ to\ get\ rid\ of\ hidden\ garbage\ is\ to\ copy\ littered\ directory
somewhere\ using\ the\ chunker\ remote\ and\ purge\ the\ original\ directory.
The\ `copy`\ command\ will\ copy\ only\ active\ chunks\ while\ the\ `purge`\ will
remove\ everything\ including\ garbage.


###\ Caveats\ and\ Limitations

Chunker\ requires\ wrapped\ remote\ to\ support\ server\ side\ `move`\ (or\ `copy`\ +
`delete`)\ operations,\ otherwise\ it\ will\ explicitly\ refuse\ to\ start.
This\ is\ because\ it\ internally\ renames\ temporary\ chunk\ files\ to\ their\ final
names\ when\ an\ operation\ completes\ successfully.

Note\ that\ a\ move\ implemented\ using\ the\ copy\-and\-delete\ method\ may\ incur
double\ charging\ with\ some\ cloud\ storage\ providers.

Chunker\ will\ not\ automatically\ rename\ existing\ chunks\ when\ you\ run
`rclone\ config`\ on\ a\ live\ remote\ and\ change\ the\ chunk\ name\ format.
Beware\ that\ in\ result\ of\ this\ some\ files\ which\ have\ been\ treated\ as\ chunks
before\ the\ change\ can\ pop\ up\ in\ directory\ listings\ as\ normal\ files
and\ vice\ versa.\ The\ same\ warning\ holds\ for\ the\ chunk\ size.
If\ you\ desperately\ need\ to\ change\ critical\ chunking\ setings,\ you\ should
run\ data\ migration\ as\ described\ above.

If\ wrapped\ remote\ is\ case\ insensitive,\ the\ chunker\ overlay\ will\ inherit
that\ property\ (so\ you\ can\[aq]t\ have\ a\ file\ called\ "Hello.doc"\ and\ "hello.doc"
in\ the\ same\ directory).

\f[C]

See\ the\ [remote\ setup\ docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/)\ for\ how\ to\ set\ it\ up\ on\ a
machine\ with\ no\ Internet\ browser\ available.

Note\ that\ rclone\ runs\ a\ webserver\ on\ your\ local\ machine\ to\ collect\ the
token\ as\ returned\ from\ Citrix\ ShareFile.\ This\ only\ runs\ from\ the\ moment\ it\ opens
your\ browser\ to\ the\ moment\ you\ get\ back\ the\ verification\ code.\ \ This
is\ on\ `http://127.0.0.1:53682/`\ and\ this\ it\ may\ require\ you\ to\ unblock
it\ temporarily\ if\ you\ are\ running\ a\ host\ firewall.

Once\ configured\ you\ can\ then\ use\ `rclone`\ like\ this,

List\ directories\ in\ top\ level\ of\ your\ ShareFile

\ \ \ \ rclone\ lsd\ remote:

List\ all\ the\ files\ in\ your\ ShareFile

\ \ \ \ rclone\ ls\ remote:

To\ copy\ a\ local\ directory\ to\ an\ ShareFile\ directory\ called\ backup

\ \ \ \ rclone\ copy\ /home/source\ remote:backup

Paths\ may\ be\ as\ deep\ as\ required,\ eg\ `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

###\ Modified\ time\ and\ hashes\ ###

ShareFile\ allows\ modification\ times\ to\ be\ set\ on\ objects\ accurate\ to\ 1
second.\ \ These\ will\ be\ used\ to\ detect\ whether\ objects\ need\ syncing\ or
not.

ShareFile\ supports\ MD5\ type\ hashes,\ so\ you\ can\ use\ the\ `\-\-checksum`
flag.

###\ Transfers\ ###

For\ files\ above\ 128MB\ rclone\ will\ use\ a\ chunked\ transfer.\ \ Rclone\ will
upload\ up\ to\ `\-\-transfers`\ chunks\ at\ the\ same\ time\ (shared\ among\ all
the\ multipart\ uploads).\ \ Chunks\ are\ buffered\ in\ memory\ and\ are
normally\ 64MB\ so\ increasing\ `\-\-transfers`\ will\ increase\ memory\ use.

###\ Limitations\ ###

Note\ that\ ShareFile\ is\ case\ insensitive\ so\ you\ can\[aq]t\ have\ a\ file\ called
"Hello.doc"\ and\ one\ called\ "hello.doc".

ShareFile\ only\ supports\ filenames\ up\ to\ 256\ characters\ in\ length.

####\ Restricted\ filename\ characters

In\ addition\ to\ the\ [default\ restricted\ characters\ set](/overview/#restricted\-characters)
the\ following\ characters\ are\ also\ replaced:

|\ Character\ |\ Value\ |\ Replacement\ |
|\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |:\-\-\-\-\-:|:\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-:|
|\ \\\\\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ 0x5C\ \ |\ ＼\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |

|\ ?\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ 0x3F\ \ |\ ？\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |
|\ :\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ 0x3A\ \ |\ ：\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |
|\ \\|\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ 0x7C\ \ |\ ｜\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |
|\ "\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ 0x22\ \ |\ ＂\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |

File\ names\ can\ also\ not\ start\ or\ end\ with\ the\ following\ characters.
These\ only\ get\ replaced\ if\ they\ are\ first\ or\ last\ character\ in\ the
name:

|\ Character\ |\ Value\ |\ Replacement\ |
|\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |:\-\-\-\-\-:|:\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-:|
|\ SP\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ 0x20\ \ |\ ␠\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |
|\ .\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ 0x2E\ \ |\ ．\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |

Invalid\ UTF\-8\ bytes\ will\ also\ be\ [replaced](/overview/#invalid\-utf8),
as\ they\ can\[aq]t\ be\ used\ in\ JSON\ strings.

Crypt
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

The\ `crypt`\ remote\ encrypts\ and\ decrypts\ another\ remote.

To\ use\ it\ first\ set\ up\ the\ underlying\ remote\ following\ the\ config
instructions\ for\ that\ remote.\ \ You\ can\ also\ use\ a\ local\ pathname
instead\ of\ a\ remote\ which\ will\ encrypt\ and\ decrypt\ from\ that\ directory
which\ might\ be\ useful\ for\ encrypting\ onto\ a\ USB\ stick\ for\ example.

First\ check\ your\ chosen\ remote\ is\ working\ \-\ we\[aq]ll\ call\ it
`remote:path`\ in\ these\ docs.\ \ Note\ that\ anything\ inside\ `remote:path`
will\ be\ encrypted\ and\ anything\ outside\ won\[aq]t.\ \ This\ means\ that\ if\ you
are\ using\ a\ bucket\ based\ remote\ (eg\ S3,\ B2,\ swift)\ then\ you\ should
probably\ put\ the\ bucket\ in\ the\ remote\ `s3:bucket`.\ If\ you\ just\ use
`s3:`\ then\ rclone\ will\ make\ encrypted\ bucket\ names\ too\ (if\ using\ file
name\ encryption)\ which\ may\ or\ may\ not\ be\ what\ you\ want.

Now\ configure\ `crypt`\ using\ `rclone\ config`.\ We\ will\ call\ this\ one
`secret`\ to\ differentiate\ it\ from\ the\ `remote`.

obscured\ so\ it\ isn\[aq]t\ immediately\ obvious\ what\ it\ is.\ \ It\ is\ in\ no\ way
secure\ unless\ you\ use\ config\ file\ encryption.

A\ long\ passphrase\ is\ recommended,\ or\ you\ can\ use\ a\ random\ one.\ \ Note
that\ if\ you\ reconfigure\ rclone\ with\ the\ same\ passwords/passphrases
elsewhere\ it\ will\ be\ compatible\ \-\ all\ the\ secrets\ used\ are\ derived
from\ those\ two\ passwords/passphrases.

Note\ that\ rclone\ does\ not\ encrypt

\ \ *\ file\ length\ \-\ this\ can\ be\ calcuated\ within\ 16\ bytes
\ \ *\ modification\ time\ \-\ used\ for\ syncing

##\ Specifying\ the\ remote\ ##

In\ normal\ use,\ make\ sure\ the\ remote\ has\ a\ `:`\ in.\ If\ you\ specify\ the
remote\ without\ a\ `:`\ then\ rclone\ will\ use\ a\ local\ directory\ of\ that
name.\ \ So\ if\ you\ use\ a\ remote\ of\ `/path/to/secret/files`\ then\ rclone
will\ encrypt\ stuff\ to\ that\ directory.\ \ If\ you\ use\ a\ remote\ of\ `name`
then\ rclone\ will\ put\ files\ in\ a\ directory\ called\ `name`\ in\ the\ current
directory.

If\ you\ specify\ the\ remote\ as\ `remote:path/to/dir`\ then\ rclone\ will
store\ encrypted\ files\ in\ `path/to/dir`\ on\ the\ remote.\ If\ you\ are\ using
file\ name\ encryption,\ then\ when\ you\ save\ files\ to
`secret:subdir/subfile`\ this\ will\ store\ them\ in\ the\ unencrypted\ path
`path/to/dir`\ but\ the\ `subdir/subpath`\ bit\ will\ be\ encrypted.

Note\ that\ unless\ you\ want\ encrypted\ bucket\ names\ (which\ are\ difficult
to\ manage\ because\ you\ won\[aq]t\ know\ what\ directory\ they\ represent\ in\ web
interfaces\ etc),\ you\ should\ probably\ specify\ a\ bucket,\ eg
`remote:secretbucket`\ when\ using\ bucket\ based\ remotes\ such\ as\ S3,
Swift,\ Hubic,\ B2,\ GCS.

###\ File\ name\ encryption\ modes\ ###

Here\ are\ some\ of\ the\ features\ of\ the\ file\ name\ encryption\ modes

Off

\ \ *\ doesn\[aq]t\ hide\ file\ names\ or\ directory\ structure
\ \ *\ allows\ for\ longer\ file\ names\ (~246\ characters)
\ \ *\ can\ use\ sub\ paths\ and\ copy\ single\ files

Standard

\ \ *\ file\ names\ encrypted
\ \ *\ file\ names\ can\[aq]t\ be\ as\ long\ (~143\ characters)
\ \ *\ can\ use\ sub\ paths\ and\ copy\ single\ files
\ \ *\ directory\ structure\ visible
\ \ *\ identical\ files\ names\ will\ have\ identical\ uploaded\ names
\ \ *\ can\ use\ shortcuts\ to\ shorten\ the\ directory\ recursion

Obfuscation

This\ is\ a\ simple\ "rotate"\ of\ the\ filename,\ with\ each\ file\ having\ a\ rot
distance\ based\ on\ the\ filename.\ We\ store\ the\ distance\ at\ the\ beginning
of\ the\ filename.\ So\ a\ file\ called\ "hello"\ may\ become\ "53.jgnnq"

This\ is\ not\ a\ strong\ encryption\ of\ filenames,\ but\ it\ may\ stop\ automated
scanning\ tools\ from\ picking\ up\ on\ filename\ patterns.\ As\ such\ it\[aq]s\ an
intermediate\ between\ "off"\ and\ "standard".\ The\ advantage\ is\ that\ it
allows\ for\ longer\ path\ segment\ names.

There\ is\ a\ possibility\ with\ some\ unicode\ based\ filenames\ that\ the
obfuscation\ is\ weak\ and\ may\ map\ lower\ case\ characters\ to\ upper\ case
equivalents.\ \ You\ can\ not\ rely\ on\ this\ for\ strong\ protection.

\ \ *\ file\ names\ very\ lightly\ obfuscated
\ \ *\ file\ names\ can\ be\ longer\ than\ standard\ encryption
\ \ *\ can\ use\ sub\ paths\ and\ copy\ single\ files
\ \ *\ directory\ structure\ visible
\ \ *\ identical\ files\ names\ will\ have\ identical\ uploaded\ names

Cloud\ storage\ systems\ have\ various\ limits\ on\ file\ name\ length\ and
total\ path\ length\ which\ you\ are\ more\ likely\ to\ hit\ using\ "Standard"
file\ name\ encryption.\ \ If\ you\ keep\ your\ file\ names\ to\ below\ 156
characters\ in\ length\ then\ you\ should\ be\ OK\ on\ all\ providers.

There\ may\ be\ an\ even\ more\ secure\ file\ name\ encryption\ mode\ in\ the
future\ which\ will\ address\ the\ long\ file\ name\ problem.

###\ Directory\ name\ encryption\ ###
Crypt\ offers\ the\ option\ of\ encrypting\ dir\ names\ or\ leaving\ them\ intact.
There\ are\ two\ options:

True

Encrypts\ the\ whole\ file\ path\ including\ directory\ names
Example:
`1/12/123.txt`\ is\ encrypted\ to
`p0e52nreeaj0a5ea7s64m4j72s/l42g6771hnv3an9cgc8cr2n1ng/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0`

False

Only\ encrypts\ file\ names,\ skips\ directory\ names
Example:
`1/12/123.txt`\ is\ encrypted\ to
`1/12/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0`


###\ Modified\ time\ and\ hashes\ ###

Crypt\ stores\ modification\ times\ using\ the\ underlying\ remote\ so\ support
depends\ on\ that.

Hashes\ are\ not\ stored\ for\ crypt.\ \ However\ the\ data\ integrity\ is
protected\ by\ an\ extremely\ strong\ crypto\ authenticator.

Note\ that\ you\ should\ use\ the\ `rclone\ cryptcheck`\ command\ to\ check\ the
integrity\ of\ a\ crypted\ remote\ instead\ of\ `rclone\ check`\ which\ can\[aq]t
check\ the\ checksums\ properly.

###\ Standard\ Options

Here\ are\ the\ standard\ options\ specific\ to\ crypt\ (Encrypt/Decrypt\ a\ remote).

####\ \-\-crypt\-remote

Remote\ to\ encrypt/decrypt.
Normally\ should\ contain\ a\ \[aq]:\[aq]\ and\ a\ path,\ eg\ "myremote:path/to/dir",
"myremote:bucket"\ or\ maybe\ "myremote:"\ (not\ recommended).

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ filename_encryption
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CRYPT_FILENAME_ENCRYPTION
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ string
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ "standard"
\-\ Examples:

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ Don\[aq]t\ encrypt\ the\ file\ names.\ \ Adds\ a\ ".bin"\ extension\ only.
\ \ \ \ \-\ "standard"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ Encrypt\ the\ filenames\ see\ the\ docs\ for\ the\ details.
\ \ \ \ \-\ "obfuscate"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ Very\ simple\ filename\ obfuscation.

####\ \-\-crypt\-directory\-name\-encryption

Option\ to\ either\ encrypt\ directory\ names\ or\ leave\ them\ intact.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ directory_name_encryption
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CRYPT_DIRECTORY_NAME_ENCRYPTION
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ bool
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ true
\-\ Examples:
\ \ \ \ \-\ "true"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ Encrypt\ directory\ names.
\ \ \ \ \-\ "false"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ Don\[aq]t\ encrypt\ directory\ names,\ leave\ them\ intact.

####\ \-\-crypt\-password

Password\ or\ pass\ phrase\ for\ encryption.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ password
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CRYPT_PASSWORD
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ string
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ ""

####\ \-\-crypt\-password2

Password\ or\ pass\ phrase\ for\ salt.\ Optional\ but\ recommended.
Should\ be\ different\ to\ the\ previous\ password.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ password2
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_CRYPT_PASSWORD2
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ string
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ ""

###\ Advanced\ Options

Here\ are\ the\ advanced\ options\ specific\ to\ crypt\ (Encrypt/Decrypt\ a\ remote).

####\ \-\-crypt\-show\-mapping

For\ all\ files\ listed\ show\ how\ the\ names\ encrypt.

If\ this\ flag\ is\ set\ then\ for\ each\ file\ that\ the\ remote\ is\ asked\ to
list,\ it\ will\ log\ (at\ level\ INFO)\ a\ line\ stating\ the\ decrypted\ file
name\ and\ the\ encrypted\ file\ name.

This\ is\ so\ you\ can\ work\ out\ which\ encrypted\ names\ are\ which\ decrypted
names\ just\ in\ case\ you\ need\ to\ do\ something\ with\ the\ encrypted\ file
names,\ or\ for\ debugging\ purposes.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ show_mapping

\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ bool
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ false

##\ Backing\ up\ a\ crypted\ remote\ ##

If\ you\ wish\ to\ backup\ a\ crypted\ remote,\ it\ it\ recommended\ that\ you\ use
`rclone\ sync`\ on\ the\ encrypted\ files,\ and\ make\ sure\ the\ passwords\ are
the\ same\ in\ the\ new\ encrypted\ remote.

This\ will\ have\ the\ following\ advantages

\ \ *\ `rclone\ sync`\ will\ check\ the\ checksums\ while\ copying
\ \ *\ you\ can\ use\ `rclone\ check`\ between\ the\ encrypted\ remotes
\ \ *\ you\ don\[aq]t\ decrypt\ and\ encrypt\ unnecessarily

For\ example,\ let\[aq]s\ say\ you\ have\ your\ original\ remote\ at\ `remote:`\ with
the\ encrypted\ version\ at\ `eremote:`\ with\ path\ `remote:crypt`.\ \ You
would\ then\ set\ up\ the\ new\ remote\ `remote2:`\ and\ then\ the\ encrypted
version\ `eremote2:`\ with\ path\ `remote2:crypt`\ using\ the\ same\ passwords
as\ `eremote:`.

To\ sync\ the\ two\ remotes\ you\ would\ do

\ \ \ \ rclone\ sync\ remote:crypt\ remote2:crypt

And\ to\ check\ the\ integrity\ you\ would\ do

\ \ \ \ rclone\ check\ remote:crypt\ remote2:crypt

##\ File\ formats\ ##

###\ File\ encryption\ ###

Files\ are\ encrypted\ 1:1\ source\ file\ to\ destination\ object.\ \ The\ file
has\ a\ header\ and\ is\ divided\ into\ chunks.

####\ Header\ ####

\ \ *\ 8\ bytes\ magic\ string\ `RCLONE\\x00\\x00`
\ \ *\ 24\ bytes\ Nonce\ (IV)

The\ initial\ nonce\ is\ generated\ from\ the\ operating\ systems\ crypto
strong\ random\ number\ generator.\ \ The\ nonce\ is\ incremented\ for\ each
chunk\ read\ making\ sure\ each\ nonce\ is\ unique\ for\ each\ block\ written.
The\ chance\ of\ a\ nonce\ being\ re\-used\ is\ minuscule.\ \ If\ you\ wrote\ an
exabyte\ of\ data\ (10¹⁸\ bytes)\ you\ would\ have\ a\ probability\ of
approximately\ 2×10⁻³²\ of\ re\-using\ a\ nonce.

####\ Chunk\ ####

Each\ chunk\ will\ contain\ 64kB\ of\ data,\ except\ for\ the\ last\ one\ which
may\ have\ less\ data.\ \ The\ data\ chunk\ is\ in\ standard\ NACL\ secretbox
format.\ Secretbox\ uses\ XSalsa20\ and\ Poly1305\ to\ encrypt\ and
authenticate\ messages.

Each\ chunk\ contains:

\ \ *\ 16\ Bytes\ of\ Poly1305\ authenticator
\ \ *\ 1\ \-\ 65536\ bytes\ XSalsa20\ encrypted\ data

64k\ chunk\ size\ was\ chosen\ as\ the\ best\ performing\ chunk\ size\ (the
authenticator\ takes\ too\ much\ time\ below\ this\ and\ the\ performance\ drops
off\ due\ to\ cache\ effects\ above\ this).\ \ Note\ that\ these\ chunks\ are
buffered\ in\ memory\ so\ they\ can\[aq]t\ be\ too\ big.

This\ uses\ a\ 32\ byte\ (256\ bit\ key)\ key\ derived\ from\ the\ user\ password.

####\ Examples\ ####

1\ byte\ file\ will\ encrypt\ to

\ \ *\ 32\ bytes\ header
\ \ *\ 17\ bytes\ data\ chunk

49\ bytes\ total

1MB\ (1048576\ bytes)\ file\ will\ encrypt\ to

\ \ *\ 32\ bytes\ header
\ \ *\ 16\ chunks\ of\ 65568\ bytes

1049120\ bytes\ total\ (a\ 0.05%\ overhead).\ \ This\ is\ the\ overhead\ for\ big
files.

###\ Name\ encryption\ ###

File\ names\ are\ encrypted\ segment\ by\ segment\ \-\ the\ path\ is\ broken\ up
into\ `/`\ separated\ strings\ and\ these\ are\ encrypted\ individually.

File\ segments\ are\ padded\ using\ using\ PKCS#7\ to\ a\ multiple\ of\ 16\ bytes
before\ encryption.

They\ are\ then\ encrypted\ with\ EME\ using\ AES\ with\ 256\ bit\ key.\ EME
(ECB\-Mix\-ECB)\ is\ a\ wide\-block\ encryption\ mode\ presented\ in\ the\ 2003
paper\ "A\ Parallelizable\ Enciphering\ Mode"\ by\ Halevi\ and\ Rogaway.

This\ makes\ for\ deterministic\ encryption\ which\ is\ what\ we\ want\ \-\ the
same\ filename\ must\ encrypt\ to\ the\ same\ thing\ otherwise\ we\ can\[aq]t\ find
it\ on\ the\ cloud\ storage\ system.

This\ means\ that

\ \ *\ filenames\ with\ the\ same\ name\ will\ encrypt\ the\ same
\ \ *\ filenames\ which\ start\ the\ same\ won\[aq]t\ have\ a\ common\ prefix

This\ uses\ a\ 32\ byte\ key\ (256\ bits)\ and\ a\ 16\ byte\ (128\ bits)\ IV\ both\ of
which\ are\ derived\ from\ the\ user\ password.

After\ encryption\ they\ are\ written\ out\ using\ a\ modified\ version\ of
standard\ `base32`\ encoding\ as\ described\ in\ RFC4648.\ \ The\ standard
encoding\ is\ modified\ in\ two\ ways:

\ \ *\ it\ becomes\ lower\ case\ (no\-one\ likes\ upper\ case\ filenames!)
\ \ *\ we\ strip\ the\ padding\ character\ `=`

`base32`\ is\ used\ rather\ than\ the\ more\ efficient\ `base64`\ so\ rclone\ can\ be
used\ on\ case\ insensitive\ remotes\ (eg\ Windows,\ Amazon\ Drive).

###\ Key\ derivation\ ###

Rclone\ uses\ `scrypt`\ with\ parameters\ `N=16384,\ r=8,\ p=1`\ with\ an
optional\ user\ supplied\ salt\ (password2)\ to\ derive\ the\ 32+32+16\ =\ 80
bytes\ of\ key\ material\ required.\ \ If\ the\ user\ doesn\[aq]t\ supply\ a\ salt
then\ rclone\ uses\ an\ internal\ one.

`scrypt`\ makes\ it\ impractical\ to\ mount\ a\ dictionary\ attack\ on\ rclone
encrypted\ data.\ \ For\ full\ protection\ against\ this\ you\ should\ always\ use
a\ salt.

Dropbox
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Paths\ are\ specified\ as\ `remote:path`

Dropbox\ paths\ may\ be\ as\ deep\ as\ required,\ eg
`remote:directory/subdirectory`.

The\ initial\ setup\ for\ dropbox\ involves\ getting\ a\ token\ from\ Dropbox
which\ you\ need\ to\ do\ in\ your\ browser.\ \ `rclone\ config`\ walks\ you
through\ it.

Here\ is\ an\ example\ of\ how\ to\ make\ a\ remote\ called\ `remote`.\ \ First\ run:

\ \ \ \ rclone\ ls\ remote:

To\ copy\ a\ local\ directory\ to\ a\ dropbox\ directory\ called\ backup

\ \ \ \ rclone\ copy\ /home/source\ remote:backup

###\ Dropbox\ for\ business\ ###

Rclone\ supports\ Dropbox\ for\ business\ and\ Team\ Folders.

When\ using\ Dropbox\ for\ business\ `remote:`\ and\ `remote:path/to/file`
will\ refer\ to\ your\ personal\ folder.

If\ you\ wish\ to\ see\ Team\ Folders\ you\ must\ use\ a\ leading\ `/`\ in\ the
path,\ so\ `rclone\ lsd\ remote:/`\ will\ refer\ to\ the\ root\ and\ show\ you\ all
Team\ Folders\ and\ your\ User\ Folder.

You\ can\ then\ use\ team\ folders\ like\ this\ `remote:/TeamFolder`\ and
`remote:/TeamFolder/path/to/file`.

A\ leading\ `/`\ for\ a\ Dropbox\ personal\ account\ will\ do\ nothing,\ but\ it
will\ take\ an\ extra\ HTTP\ transaction\ so\ it\ should\ be\ avoided.

###\ Modified\ time\ and\ Hashes\ ###

Dropbox\ supports\ modified\ times,\ but\ the\ only\ way\ to\ set\ a
modification\ time\ is\ to\ re\-upload\ the\ file.

This\ means\ that\ if\ you\ uploaded\ your\ data\ with\ an\ older\ version\ of
rclone\ which\ didn\[aq]t\ support\ the\ v2\ API\ and\ modified\ times,\ rclone\ will
decide\ to\ upload\ all\ your\ old\ data\ to\ fix\ the\ modification\ times.\ \ If
you\ don\[aq]t\ want\ this\ to\ happen\ use\ `\-\-size\-only`\ or\ `\-\-checksum`\ flag
to\ stop\ it.

Dropbox\ supports\ [its\ own\ hash
type](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/content\-hash)\ which
is\ checked\ for\ all\ transfers.

###\ Standard\ Options

Here\ are\ the\ standard\ options\ specific\ to\ dropbox\ (Dropbox).

####\ \-\-dropbox\-client\-id

###\ Advanced\ Options

Here\ are\ the\ advanced\ options\ specific\ to\ dropbox\ (Dropbox).

####\ \-\-dropbox\-chunk\-size

Upload\ chunk\ size.\ (<\ 150M).

Any\ files\ larger\ than\ this\ will\ be\ uploaded\ in\ chunks\ of\ this\ size.

Note\ that\ chunks\ are\ buffered\ in\ memory\ (one\ at\ a\ time)\ so\ rclone\ can
deal\ with\ retries.\ \ Setting\ this\ larger\ will\ increase\ the\ speed
slightly\ (at\ most\ 10%\ for\ 128MB\ in\ tests)\ at\ the\ cost\ of\ using\ more
memory.\ \ It\ can\ be\ set\ smaller\ if\ you\ are\ tight\ on\ memory.

###\ Limitations\ ###

Note\ that\ Dropbox\ is\ case\ insensitive\ so\ you\ can\[aq]t\ have\ a\ file\ called
"Hello.doc"\ and\ one\ called\ "hello.doc".

There\ are\ some\ file\ names\ such\ as\ `thumbs.db`\ which\ Dropbox\ can\[aq]t
store.\ \ There\ is\ a\ full\ list\ of\ them\ in\ the\ ["Ignored\ Files"\ section
of\ this\ document](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/145).\ \ Rclone\ will
issue\ an\ error\ message\ `File\ name\ disallowed\ \-\ not\ uploading`\ if\ it
attempts\ to\ upload\ one\ of\ those\ file\ names,\ but\ the\ sync\ won\[aq]t\ fail.

If\ you\ have\ more\ than\ 10,000\ files\ in\ a\ directory\ then\ `rclone\ purge
dropbox:dir`\ will\ return\ the\ error\ `Failed\ to\ purge:\ There\ are\ too
many\ files\ involved\ in\ this\ operation`.\ \ As\ a\ work\-around\ do\ an
`rclone\ delete\ dropbox:dir`\ followed\ by\ an\ `rclone\ rmdir\ dropbox:dir`.

FTP
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

FTP\ is\ the\ File\ Transfer\ Protocol.\ FTP\ support\ is\ provided\ using\ the
[github.com/jlaffaye/ftp](https://godoc.org/github.com/jlaffaye/ftp)
package.

Here\ is\ an\ example\ of\ making\ an\ FTP\ configuration.\ \ First\ run

\ \ \ \ rclone\ config

This\ will\ guide\ you\ through\ an\ interactive\ setup\ process.\ An\ FTP\ remote\ only
needs\ a\ host\ together\ with\ and\ a\ username\ and\ a\ password.\ With\ anonymous\ FTP
server,\ you\ will\ need\ to\ use\ `anonymous`\ as\ username\ and\ your\ email\ address\ as
the\ password.

This\ remote\ is\ called\ `remote`\ and\ can\ now\ be\ used\ like\ this

See\ all\ directories\ in\ the\ home\ directory

\ \ \ \ rclone\ lsd\ remote:

Make\ a\ new\ directory

\ \ \ \ rclone\ mkdir\ remote:path/to/directory

List\ the\ contents\ of\ a\ directory

\ \ \ \ rclone\ ls\ remote:path/to/directory

Sync\ `/home/local/directory`\ to\ the\ remote\ directory,\ deleting\ any
excess\ files\ in\ the\ directory.

\ \ \ \ rclone\ sync\ /home/local/directory\ remote:directory

###\ Modified\ time\ ###

FTP\ does\ not\ support\ modified\ times.\ \ Any\ times\ you\ see\ on\ the\ server
will\ be\ time\ of\ upload.

###\ Checksums\ ###

FTP\ does\ not\ support\ any\ checksums.

####\ Restricted\ filename\ characters

In\ addition\ to\ the\ [default\ restricted\ characters\ set](/overview/#restricted\-characters)
the\ following\ characters\ are\ also\ replaced:

File\ names\ can\ also\ not\ end\ with\ the\ following\ characters.
These\ only\ get\ replaced\ if\ they\ are\ last\ character\ in\ the\ name:

|\ Character\ |\ Value\ |\ Replacement\ |
|\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |:\-\-\-\-\-:|:\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-:|
|\ SP\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\ 0x20\ \ |\ ␠\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |

Note\ that\ not\ all\ FTP\ servers\ can\ have\ all\ characters\ in\ file\ names,\ for\ example:

|\ FTP\ Server|\ Forbidden\ characters\ |
|\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |:\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-:|
|\ proftpd\ \ \ |\ `*`\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |
|\ pureftpd\ \ |\ `\\\ [\ ]`\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |

###\ Implicit\ TLS\ ###

FTP\ supports\ implicit\ FTP\ over\ TLS\ servers\ (FTPS).\ This\ has\ to\ be\ enabled
in\ the\ config\ for\ the\ remote.\ The\ default\ FTPS\ port\ is\ `990`\ so\ the
port\ will\ likely\ have\ to\ be\ explictly\ set\ in\ the\ config\ for\ the\ remote.

###\ Limitations\ ###

Note\ that\ since\ FTP\ isn\[aq]t\ HTTP\ based\ the\ following\ flags\ don\[aq]t\ work
with\ it:\ `\-\-dump\-headers`,\ `\-\-dump\-bodies`,\ `\-\-dump\-auth`

Note\ that\ `\-\-timeout`\ isn\[aq]t\ supported\ (but\ `\-\-contimeout`\ is).

Note\ that\ `\-\-bind`\ isn\[aq]t\ supported.

FTP\ could\ support\ server\ side\ move\ but\ doesn\[aq]t\ yet.

Note\ that\ the\ ftp\ backend\ does\ not\ support\ the\ `ftp_proxy`\ environment
variable\ yet.

Note\ that\ while\ implicit\ FTP\ over\ TLS\ is\ supported,
explicit\ FTP\ over\ TLS\ is\ not.

Google\ Cloud\ Storage
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Paths\ are\ specified\ as\ `remote:bucket`\ (or\ `remote:`\ for\ the\ `lsd`

Note\ that\ rclone\ runs\ a\ webserver\ on\ your\ local\ machine\ to\ collect\ the
token\ as\ returned\ from\ Google\ if\ you\ use\ auto\ config\ mode.\ This\ only
runs\ from\ the\ moment\ it\ opens\ your\ browser\ to\ the\ moment\ you\ get\ back
the\ verification\ code.\ \ This\ is\ on\ `http://127.0.0.1:53682/`\ and\ this
it\ may\ require\ you\ to\ unblock\ it\ temporarily\ if\ you\ are\ running\ a\ host
firewall,\ or\ use\ manual\ mode.

This\ remote\ is\ called\ `remote`\ and\ can\ now\ be\ used\ like\ this

See\ all\ the\ buckets\ in\ your\ project

\ \ \ \ rclone\ lsd\ remote:

Make\ a\ new\ bucket

\ \ \ \ rclone\ mkdir\ remote:bucket

List\ the\ contents\ of\ a\ bucket

\ \ \ \ rclone\ ls\ remote:bucket

Sync\ `/home/local/directory`\ to\ the\ remote\ bucket,\ deleting\ any\ excess
files\ in\ the\ bucket.

\ \ \ \ rclone\ sync\ /home/local/directory\ remote:bucket

###\ Service\ Account\ support\ ###

You\ can\ set\ up\ rclone\ with\ Google\ Cloud\ Storage\ in\ an\ unattended\ mode,
i.e.\ not\ tied\ to\ a\ specific\ end\-user\ Google\ account.\ This\ is\ useful
when\ you\ want\ to\ synchronise\ files\ onto\ machines\ that\ don\[aq]t\ have
actively\ logged\-in\ users,\ for\ example\ build\ machines.

To\ get\ credentials\ for\ Google\ Cloud\ Platform
[IAM\ Service\ Accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service\-accounts),
please\ head\ to\ the
[Service\ Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/permissions/serviceaccounts)
section\ of\ the\ Google\ Developer\ Console.\ Service\ Accounts\ behave\ just
like\ normal\ `User`\ permissions\ in
[Google\ Cloud\ Storage\ ACLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access\-control),
so\ you\ can\ limit\ their\ access\ (e.g.\ make\ them\ read\ only).\ After
creating\ an\ account,\ a\ JSON\ file\ containing\ the\ Service\ Account\[aq]s
credentials\ will\ be\ downloaded\ onto\ your\ machines.\ These\ credentials
are\ what\ rclone\ will\ use\ for\ authentication.

To\ use\ a\ Service\ Account\ instead\ of\ OAuth2\ token\ flow,\ enter\ the\ path
to\ your\ Service\ Account\ credentials\ at\ the\ `service_account_file`
prompt\ and\ rclone\ won\[aq]t\ use\ the\ browser\ based\ authentication
flow.\ If\ you\[aq]d\ rather\ stuff\ the\ contents\ of\ the\ credentials\ file\ into
the\ rclone\ config\ file,\ you\ can\ set\ `service_account_credentials`\ with
the\ actual\ contents\ of\ the\ file\ instead,\ or\ set\ the\ equivalent
environment\ variable.

###\ Application\ Default\ Credentials\ ###

If\ no\ other\ source\ of\ credentials\ is\ provided,\ rclone\ will\ fall\ back
to
[Application\ Default\ Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/video\-intelligence/docs/common/auth#authenticating_with_application_default_credentials)
this\ is\ useful\ both\ when\ you\ already\ have\ configured\ authentication
for\ your\ developer\ account,\ or\ in\ production\ when\ running\ on\ a\ google
compute\ host.\ Note\ that\ if\ running\ in\ docker,\ you\ may\ need\ to\ run
additional\ commands\ on\ your\ google\ compute\ machine\ \-
[see\ this\ page](https://cloud.google.com/container\-registry/docs/advanced\-authentication#gcloud_as_a_docker_credential_helper).

Note\ that\ in\ the\ case\ application\ default\ credentials\ are\ used,\ there
is\ no\ need\ to\ explicitly\ configure\ a\ project\ number.

###\ \-\-fast\-list\ ###

This\ remote\ supports\ `\-\-fast\-list`\ which\ allows\ you\ to\ use\ fewer
transactions\ in\ exchange\ for\ more\ memory.\ See\ the\ [rclone
docs](/docs/#fast\-list)\ for\ more\ details.

###\ Modified\ time\ ###

Google\ google\ cloud\ storage\ stores\ md5sums\ natively\ and\ rclone\ stores
modification\ times\ as\ metadata\ on\ the\ object,\ under\ the\ "mtime"\ key\ in
RFC3339\ format\ accurate\ to\ 1ns.

Google\ Drive
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Paths\ are\ specified\ as\ `drive:path`

Drive\ paths\ may\ be\ as\ deep\ as\ required,\ eg\ `drive:directory/subdirectory`.

The\ initial\ setup\ for\ drive\ involves\ getting\ a\ token\ from\ Google\ drive
which\ you\ need\ to\ do\ in\ your\ browser.\ \ `rclone\ config`\ walks\ you
through\ it.

Here\ is\ an\ example\ of\ how\ to\ make\ a\ remote\ called\ `remote`.\ \ First\ run:

\ \ \ \ \ rclone\ config

This\ will\ guide\ you\ through\ an\ interactive\ setup\ process:

\f[C]

Note\ that\ rclone\ runs\ a\ webserver\ on\ your\ local\ machine\ to\ collect\ the
token\ as\ returned\ from\ Google\ if\ you\ use\ auto\ config\ mode.\ This\ only
runs\ from\ the\ moment\ it\ opens\ your\ browser\ to\ the\ moment\ you\ get\ back
the\ verification\ code.\ \ This\ is\ on\ `http://127.0.0.1:53682/`\ and\ this
it\ may\ require\ you\ to\ unblock\ it\ temporarily\ if\ you\ are\ running\ a\ host
firewall,\ or\ use\ manual\ mode.

You\ can\ then\ use\ it\ like\ this,

List\ directories\ in\ top\ level\ of\ your\ drive

\ \ \ \ rclone\ lsd\ remote:

List\ all\ the\ files\ in\ your\ drive

\ \ \ \ rclone\ ls\ remote:

To\ copy\ a\ local\ directory\ to\ a\ drive\ directory\ called\ backup

\ \ \ \ rclone\ copy\ /home/source\ remote:backup

###\ Scopes\ ###

Rclone\ allows\ you\ to\ select\ which\ scope\ you\ would\ like\ for\ rclone\ to
use.\ \ This\ changes\ what\ type\ of\ token\ is\ granted\ to\ rclone.\ \ [The
scopes\ are\ defined
here.](https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/about\-auth).

The\ scope\ are

####\ drive\ ####

This\ is\ the\ default\ scope\ and\ allows\ full\ access\ to\ all\ files,\ except
for\ the\ Application\ Data\ Folder\ (see\ below).

Choose\ this\ one\ if\ you\ aren\[aq]t\ sure.

####\ drive.readonly\ ####

This\ allows\ read\ only\ access\ to\ all\ files.\ \ Files\ may\ be\ listed\ and
downloaded\ but\ not\ uploaded,\ renamed\ or\ deleted.

####\ drive.file\ ####

With\ this\ scope\ rclone\ can\ read/view/modify\ only\ those\ files\ and
folders\ it\ creates.

So\ if\ you\ uploaded\ files\ to\ drive\ via\ the\ web\ interface\ (or\ any\ other
means)\ they\ will\ not\ be\ visible\ to\ rclone.

This\ can\ be\ useful\ if\ you\ are\ using\ rclone\ to\ backup\ data\ and\ you\ want
to\ be\ sure\ confidential\ data\ on\ your\ drive\ is\ not\ visible\ to\ rclone.

Files\ created\ with\ this\ scope\ are\ visible\ in\ the\ web\ interface.

####\ drive.appfolder\ ####

This\ gives\ rclone\ its\ own\ private\ area\ to\ store\ files.\ \ Rclone\ will
not\ be\ able\ to\ see\ any\ other\ files\ on\ your\ drive\ and\ you\ won\[aq]t\ be\ able
to\ see\ rclone\[aq]s\ files\ from\ the\ web\ interface\ either.

####\ drive.metadata.readonly\ ####

This\ allows\ read\ only\ access\ to\ file\ names\ only.\ \ It\ does\ not\ allow
rclone\ to\ download\ or\ upload\ data,\ or\ rename\ or\ delete\ files\ or
directories.

###\ Root\ folder\ ID\ ###

You\ can\ set\ the\ `root_folder_id`\ for\ rclone.\ \ This\ is\ the\ directory
(identified\ by\ its\ `Folder\ ID`)\ that\ rclone\ considers\ to\ be\ the\ root
of\ your\ drive.

Normally\ you\ will\ leave\ this\ blank\ and\ rclone\ will\ determine\ the
correct\ root\ to\ use\ itself.

However\ you\ can\ set\ this\ to\ restrict\ rclone\ to\ a\ specific\ folder
hierarchy\ or\ to\ access\ data\ within\ the\ "Computers"\ tab\ on\ the\ drive
web\ interface\ (where\ files\ from\ Google\[aq]s\ Backup\ and\ Sync\ desktop
program\ go).

In\ order\ to\ do\ this\ you\ will\ have\ to\ find\ the\ `Folder\ ID`\ of\ the
directory\ you\ wish\ rclone\ to\ display.\ \ This\ will\ be\ the\ last\ segment
of\ the\ URL\ when\ you\ open\ the\ relevant\ folder\ in\ the\ drive\ web
interface.

So\ if\ the\ folder\ you\ want\ rclone\ to\ use\ has\ a\ URL\ which\ looks\ like
`https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh`
in\ the\ browser,\ then\ you\ use\ `1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh`\ as
the\ `root_folder_id`\ in\ the\ config.

**NB**\ folders\ under\ the\ "Computers"\ tab\ seem\ to\ be\ read\ only\ (drive
gives\ a\ 500\ error)\ when\ using\ rclone.

There\ doesn\[aq]t\ appear\ to\ be\ an\ API\ to\ discover\ the\ folder\ IDs\ of\ the
"Computers"\ tab\ \-\ please\ contact\ us\ if\ you\ know\ otherwise!

Note\ also\ that\ rclone\ can\[aq]t\ access\ any\ data\ under\ the\ "Backups"\ tab\ on
the\ google\ drive\ web\ interface\ yet.

###\ Service\ Account\ support\ ###

You\ can\ set\ up\ rclone\ with\ Google\ Drive\ in\ an\ unattended\ mode,
i.e.\ not\ tied\ to\ a\ specific\ end\-user\ Google\ account.\ This\ is\ useful
when\ you\ want\ to\ synchronise\ files\ onto\ machines\ that\ don\[aq]t\ have
actively\ logged\-in\ users,\ for\ example\ build\ machines.

To\ use\ a\ Service\ Account\ instead\ of\ OAuth2\ token\ flow,\ enter\ the\ path
to\ your\ Service\ Account\ credentials\ at\ the\ `service_account_file`
prompt\ during\ `rclone\ config`\ and\ rclone\ won\[aq]t\ use\ the\ browser\ based
authentication\ flow.\ If\ you\[aq]d\ rather\ stuff\ the\ contents\ of\ the
credentials\ file\ into\ the\ rclone\ config\ file,\ you\ can\ set
`service_account_credentials`\ with\ the\ actual\ contents\ of\ the\ file
instead,\ or\ set\ the\ equivalent\ environment\ variable.

####\ Use\ case\ \-\ Google\ Apps/G\-suite\ account\ and\ individual\ Drive\ ####

Let\[aq]s\ say\ that\ you\ are\ the\ administrator\ of\ a\ Google\ Apps\ (old)\ or
G\-suite\ account.
The\ goal\ is\ to\ store\ data\ on\ an\ individual\[aq]s\ Drive\ account,\ who\ IS
a\ member\ of\ the\ domain.
We\[aq]ll\ call\ the\ domain\ **example.com**,\ and\ the\ user
**foo\@example.com**.

There\[aq]s\ a\ few\ steps\ we\ need\ to\ go\ through\ to\ accomplish\ this:

#####\ 1.\ Create\ a\ service\ account\ for\ example.com\ #####
\ \ \-\ To\ create\ a\ service\ account\ and\ obtain\ its\ credentials,\ go\ to\ the
[Google\ Developer\ Console](https://console.developers.google.com).
\ \ \-\ You\ must\ have\ a\ project\ \-\ create\ one\ if\ you\ don\[aq]t.
\ \ \-\ Then\ go\ to\ "IAM\ &\ admin"\ \->\ "Service\ Accounts".
\ \ \-\ Use\ the\ "Create\ Credentials"\ button.\ Fill\ in\ "Service\ account\ name"
with\ something\ that\ identifies\ your\ client.\ "Role"\ can\ be\ empty.
\ \ \-\ Tick\ "Furnish\ a\ new\ private\ key"\ \-\ select\ "Key\ type\ JSON".
\ \ \-\ Tick\ "Enable\ G\ Suite\ Domain\-wide\ Delegation".\ This\ option\ makes
"impersonation"\ possible,\ as\ documented\ here:
[Delegating\ domain\-wide\ authority\ to\ the\ service\ account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#delegatingauthority)
\ \ \-\ These\ credentials\ are\ what\ rclone\ will\ use\ for\ authentication.
If\ you\ ever\ need\ to\ remove\ access,\ press\ the\ "Delete\ service
account\ key"\ button.

#####\ 2.\ Allowing\ API\ access\ to\ example.com\ Google\ Drive\ #####
\ \ \-\ Go\ to\ example.com\[aq]s\ admin\ console
\ \ \-\ Go\ into\ "Security"\ (or\ use\ the\ search\ bar)
\ \ \-\ Select\ "Show\ more"\ and\ then\ "Advanced\ settings"
\ \ \-\ Select\ "Manage\ API\ client\ access"\ in\ the\ "Authentication"\ section
\ \ \-\ In\ the\ "Client\ Name"\ field\ enter\ the\ service\ account\[aq]s
"Client\ ID"\ \-\ this\ can\ be\ found\ in\ the\ Developer\ Console\ under
"IAM\ &\ Admin"\ \->\ "Service\ Accounts",\ then\ "View\ Client\ ID"\ for
the\ newly\ created\ service\ account.
It\ is\ a\ ~21\ character\ numerical\ string.
\ \ \-\ In\ the\ next\ field,\ "One\ or\ More\ API\ Scopes",\ enter
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`
to\ grant\ access\ to\ Google\ Drive\ specifically.

#####\ 3.\ Configure\ rclone,\ assuming\ a\ new\ install\ #####
\f[]

#####\ 4.\ Verify\ that\ it\[aq]s\ working\ #####
\ \ \-\ `rclone\ \-v\ \-\-drive\-impersonate\ foo\@example.com\ lsf\ gdrive:backup`
\ \ \-\ The\ arguments\ do:
\ \ \ \ \-\ `\-v`\ \-\ verbose\ logging
\ \ \ \ \-\ `\-\-drive\-impersonate\ foo\@example.com`\ \-\ this\ is\ what\ does
the\ magic,\ pretending\ to\ be\ user\ foo.
\ \ \ \ \-\ `lsf`\ \-\ list\ files\ in\ a\ parsing\ friendly\ way
\ \ \ \ \-\ `gdrive:backup`\ \-\ use\ the\ remote\ called\ gdrive,\ work\ in
the\ folder\ named\ backup.

###\ Team\ drives\ ###

If\ you\ want\ to\ configure\ the\ remote\ to\ point\ to\ a\ Google\ Team\ Drive
then\ answer\ `y`\ to\ the\ question\ `Configure\ this\ as\ a\ team\ drive?`.

This\ will\ fetch\ the\ list\ of\ Team\ Drives\ from\ google\ and\ allow\ you\ to
configure\ which\ one\ you\ want\ to\ use.\ \ You\ can\ also\ type\ in\ a\ team
drive\ ID\ if\ you\ prefer.

For\ example:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Configure this as a team drive?
y) Yes n) No y/n> y Fetching team drive list\&... Choose a number from
below, or type in your own value 1 / Rclone Test

###\ \-\-fast\-list\ ###

This\ remote\ supports\ `\-\-fast\-list`\ which\ allows\ you\ to\ use\ fewer
transactions\ in\ exchange\ for\ more\ memory.\ See\ the\ [rclone
docs](/docs/#fast\-list)\ for\ more\ details.

It\ does\ this\ by\ combining\ multiple\ `list`\ calls\ into\ a\ single\ API\ request.

This\ works\ by\ combining\ many\ `\[aq]%s\[aq]\ in\ parents`\ filters\ into\ one\ expression.
To\ list\ the\ contents\ of\ directories\ a,\ b\ and\ c,\ the\ following\ requests\ will\ be\ send\ by\ the\ regular\ `List`\ function:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
trashed=false and `a' in parents trashed=false and `b' in parents
trashed=false and `c' in parents
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
These\ can\ now\ be\ combined\ into\ a\ single\ request:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
trashed=false and (`a' in parents or `b' in parents or `c' in parents)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

The\ implementation\ of\ `ListR`\ will\ put\ up\ to\ 50\ `parents`\ filters\ into\ one\ request.
It\ will\ \ use\ the\ `\-\-checkers`\ value\ to\ specify\ the\ number\ of\ requests\ to\ run\ in\ parallel.

In\ tests,\ these\ batch\ requests\ were\ up\ to\ 20x\ faster\ than\ the\ regular\ method.
Running\ the\ following\ command\ against\ different\ sized\ folders\ gives:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
rclone lsjson \-vv \-R \[en]checkers=6 gdrive:folder
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

small\ folder\ (220\ directories,\ 700\ files):

\-\ without\ `\-\-fast\-list`:\ 38s
\-\ with\ `\-\-fast\-list`:\ 10s

large\ folder\ (10600\ directories,\ 39000\ files):

\-\ without\ `\-\-fast\-list`:\ 22:05\ min
\-\ with\ `\-\-fast\-list`:\ 58s

###\ Modified\ time\ ###

Google\ drive\ stores\ modification\ times\ accurate\ to\ 1\ ms.

####\ Restricted\ filename\ characters

Only\ Invalid\ UTF\-8\ bytes\ will\ be\ [replaced](/overview/#invalid\-utf8),
as\ they\ can\[aq]t\ be\ used\ in\ JSON\ strings.

In\ contrast\ to\ other\ backends,\ `/`\ can\ also\ be\ used\ in\ names\ and\ `.`
or\ `..`\ are\ valid\ names.

###\ Revisions\ ###

Google\ drive\ stores\ revisions\ of\ files.\ \ When\ you\ upload\ a\ change\ to
an\ existing\ file\ to\ google\ drive\ using\ rclone\ it\ will\ create\ a\ new
revision\ of\ that\ file.

Revisions\ follow\ the\ standard\ google\ policy\ which\ at\ time\ of\ writing
was

\ \ *\ They\ are\ deleted\ after\ 30\ days\ or\ 100\ revisions\ (whatever\ comes\ first).
\ \ *\ They\ do\ not\ count\ towards\ a\ user\ storage\ quota.

###\ Deleting\ files\ ###

By\ default\ rclone\ will\ send\ all\ files\ to\ the\ trash\ when\ deleting
files.\ \ If\ deleting\ them\ permanently\ is\ required\ then\ use\ the
`\-\-drive\-use\-trash=false`\ flag,\ or\ set\ the\ equivalent\ environment
variable.

###\ Emptying\ trash\ ###

If\ you\ wish\ to\ empty\ your\ trash\ you\ can\ use\ the\ `rclone\ cleanup\ remote:`
command\ which\ will\ permanently\ delete\ all\ your\ trashed\ files.\ This\ command
does\ not\ take\ any\ path\ arguments.

Note\ that\ Google\ Drive\ takes\ some\ time\ (minutes\ to\ days)\ to\ empty\ the
trash\ even\ though\ the\ command\ returns\ within\ a\ few\ seconds.\ \ No\ output
is\ echoed,\ so\ there\ will\ be\ no\ confirmation\ even\ using\ \-v\ or\ \-vv.

###\ Quota\ information\ ###

To\ view\ your\ current\ quota\ you\ can\ use\ the\ `rclone\ about\ remote:`
command\ which\ will\ display\ your\ usage\ limit\ (quota),\ the\ usage\ in\ Google
Drive,\ the\ size\ of\ all\ files\ in\ the\ Trash\ and\ the\ space\ used\ by\ other
Google\ services\ such\ as\ Gmail.\ This\ command\ does\ not\ take\ any\ path
arguments.

####\ Import/Export\ of\ google\ documents\ ####

Google\ documents\ can\ be\ exported\ from\ and\ uploaded\ to\ Google\ Drive.

When\ rclone\ downloads\ a\ Google\ doc\ it\ chooses\ a\ format\ to\ download
depending\ upon\ the\ `\-\-drive\-export\-formats`\ setting.
By\ default\ the\ export\ formats\ are\ `docx,xlsx,pptx,svg`\ which\ are\ a
sensible\ default\ for\ an\ editable\ document.

When\ choosing\ a\ format,\ rclone\ runs\ down\ the\ list\ provided\ in\ order
and\ chooses\ the\ first\ file\ format\ the\ doc\ can\ be\ exported\ as\ from\ the
list.\ If\ the\ file\ can\[aq]t\ be\ exported\ to\ a\ format\ on\ the\ formats\ list,
then\ rclone\ will\ choose\ a\ format\ from\ the\ default\ list.

If\ you\ prefer\ an\ archive\ copy\ then\ you\ might\ use\ `\-\-drive\-export\-formats
pdf`,\ or\ if\ you\ prefer\ openoffice/libreoffice\ formats\ you\ might\ use
`\-\-drive\-export\-formats\ ods,odt,odp`.

Note\ that\ rclone\ adds\ the\ extension\ to\ the\ google\ doc,\ so\ if\ it\ is
called\ `My\ Spreadsheet`\ on\ google\ docs,\ it\ will\ be\ exported\ as\ `My
Spreadsheet.xlsx`\ or\ `My\ Spreadsheet.pdf`\ etc.

When\ importing\ files\ into\ Google\ Drive,\ rclone\ will\ convert\ all
files\ with\ an\ extension\ in\ `\-\-drive\-import\-formats`\ to\ their
associated\ document\ type.
rclone\ will\ not\ convert\ any\ files\ by\ default,\ since\ the\ conversion
is\ lossy\ process.

The\ conversion\ must\ result\ in\ a\ file\ with\ the\ same\ extension\ when
the\ `\-\-drive\-export\-formats`\ rules\ are\ applied\ to\ the\ uploaded\ document.

Here\ are\ some\ examples\ for\ allowed\ and\ prohibited\ conversions.

|\ export\-formats\ |\ import\-formats\ |\ Upload\ Ext\ |\ Document\ Ext\ |\ Allowed\ |
|\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ |
|\ odt\ |\ odt\ |\ odt\ |\ odt\ |\ Yes\ |
|\ odt\ |\ docx,odt\ |\ odt\ |\ odt\ |\ Yes\ |
|\ \ |\ docx\ |\ docx\ |\ docx\ |\ Yes\ |
|\ \ |\ odt\ |\ odt\ |\ docx\ |\ No\ |
|\ odt,docx\ |\ docx,odt\ |\ docx\ |\ odt\ |\ No\ |
|\ docx,odt\ |\ docx,odt\ |\ docx\ |\ docx\ |\ Yes\ |
|\ docx,odt\ |\ docx,odt\ |\ odt\ |\ docx\ |\ No\ |

This\ limitation\ can\ be\ disabled\ by\ specifying\ `\-\-drive\-allow\-import\-name\-change`.
When\ using\ this\ flag,\ rclone\ can\ convert\ multiple\ files\ types\ resulting
in\ the\ same\ document\ type\ at\ once,\ eg\ with\ `\-\-drive\-import\-formats\ docx,odt,txt`,
all\ files\ having\ these\ extension\ would\ result\ in\ a\ document\ represented\ as\ a\ docx\ file.
This\ brings\ the\ additional\ risk\ of\ overwriting\ a\ document,\ if\ multiple\ files

Instructs\ rclone\ to\ operate\ on\ your\ "Shared\ with\ me"\ folder\ (where
Google\ Drive\ lets\ you\ access\ the\ files\ and\ folders\ others\ have\ shared
with\ you).

This\ works\ both\ with\ the\ "list"\ (lsd,\ lsl,\ etc)\ and\ the\ "copy"
commands\ (copy,\ sync,\ etc),\ and\ with\ all\ other\ commands\ too.

####\ \-\-drive\-use\-created\-date

Use\ file\ created\ date\ instead\ of\ modified\ date.,

Useful\ when\ downloading\ data\ and\ you\ want\ the\ creation\ date\ used\ in
place\ of\ the\ last\ modified\ date.

**WARNING**:\ This\ flag\ may\ have\ some\ unexpected\ consequences.

When\ uploading\ to\ your\ drive\ all\ files\ will\ be\ overwritten\ unless\ they
haven\[aq]t\ been\ modified\ since\ their\ creation.\ And\ the\ inverse\ will\ occur
while\ downloading.\ \ This\ side\ effect\ can\ be\ avoided\ by\ using\ the
"\-\-checksum"\ flag.

This\ feature\ was\ implemented\ to\ retain\ photos\ capture\ date\ as\ recorded
by\ google\ photos.\ You\ will\ first\ need\ to\ check\ the\ "Create\ a\ Google
Photos\ folder"\ option\ in\ your\ google\ drive\ settings.\ You\ can\ then\ copy
or\ move\ the\ photos\ locally\ and\ use\ the\ date\ the\ image\ was\ taken
(created)\ set\ as\ the\ modification\ date.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ use_created_date

\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ ""

####\ \-\-drive\-alternate\-export

Use\ alternate\ export\ URLs\ for\ google\ documents\ export.,

If\ this\ option\ is\ set\ this\ instructs\ rclone\ to\ use\ an\ alternate\ set\ of
export\ URLs\ for\ drive\ documents.\ \ Users\ have\ reported\ that\ the
official\ export\ URLs\ can\[aq]t\ export\ large\ documents,\ whereas\ these
unofficial\ ones\ can.

See\ rclone\ issue\ [#2243](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2243)\ for\ background,
[this\ google\ drive\ issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36761333)\ and

####\ \-\-drive\-chunk\-size

Upload\ chunk\ size.\ Must\ a\ power\ of\ 2\ >=\ 256k.

Making\ this\ larger\ will\ improve\ performance,\ but\ note\ that\ each\ chunk
is\ buffered\ in\ memory\ one\ per\ transfer.

Reducing\ this\ will\ reduce\ memory\ usage\ but\ decrease\ performance.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ chunk_size
\-\ Env\ Var:\ \ \ \ \ RCLONE_DRIVE_CHUNK_SIZE
\-\ Type:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ SizeSuffix
\-\ Default:\ \ \ \ \ 8M

####\ \-\-drive\-acknowledge\-abuse

Set\ to\ allow\ files\ which\ return\ cannotDownloadAbusiveFile\ to\ be\ downloaded.

If\ downloading\ a\ file\ returns\ the\ error\ "This\ file\ has\ been\ identified
as\ malware\ or\ spam\ and\ cannot\ be\ downloaded"\ with\ the\ error\ code
"cannotDownloadAbusiveFile"\ then\ supply\ this\ flag\ to\ rclone\ to
indicate\ you\ acknowledge\ the\ risks\ of\ downloading\ the\ file\ and\ rclone
will\ download\ it\ anyway.

\-\ Config:\ \ \ \ \ \ acknowledge_abuse

####\ \-\-drive\-server\-side\-across\-configs

Allow\ server\ side\ operations\ (eg\ copy)\ to\ work\ across\ different\ drive\ configs.

This\ can\ be\ useful\ if\ you\ wish\ to\ do\ a\ server\ side\ copy\ between\ two

###\ Limitations\ ###

Drive\ has\ quite\ a\ lot\ of\ rate\ limiting.\ \ This\ causes\ rclone\ to\ be
limited\ to\ transferring\ about\ 2\ files\ per\ second\ only.\ \ Individual
files\ may\ be\ transferred\ much\ faster\ at\ 100s\ of\ MBytes/s\ but\ lots\ of
small\ files\ can\ take\ a\ long\ time.

Server\ side\ copies\ are\ also\ subject\ to\ a\ separate\ rate\ limit.\ If\ you
see\ User\ rate\ limit\ exceeded\ errors,\ wait\ at\ least\ 24\ hours\ and\ retry.
You\ can\ disable\ server\ side\ copies\ with\ `\-\-disable\ copy`\ to\ download
and\ upload\ the\ files\ if\ you\ prefer.

####\ Limitations\ of\ Google\ Docs\ ####

Google\ docs\ will\ appear\ as\ size\ \-1\ in\ `rclone\ ls`\ and\ as\ size\ 0\ in
anything\ which\ uses\ the\ VFS\ layer,\ eg\ `rclone\ mount`,\ `rclone\ serve`.

This\ is\ because\ rclone\ can\[aq]t\ find\ out\ the\ size\ of\ the\ Google\ docs
without\ downloading\ them.

Google\ docs\ will\ transfer\ correctly\ with\ `rclone\ sync`,\ `rclone\ copy`
etc\ as\ rclone\ knows\ to\ ignore\ the\ size\ when\ doing\ the\ transfer.

However\ an\ unfortunate\ consequence\ of\ this\ is\ that\ you\ may\ not\ be\ able
to\ download\ Google\ docs\ using\ `rclone\ mount`.\ If\ it\ doesn\[aq]t\ work\ you
will\ get\ a\ 0\ sized\ file.\ \ If\ you\ try\ again\ the\ doc\ may\ gain\ its
correct\ size\ and\ be\ downloadable.\ Whther\ it\ will\ work\ on\ not\ depends
on\ the\ application\ accessing\ the\ mount\ and\ the\ OS\ you\ are\ running\ \-
experiment\ to\ find\ out\ if\ it\ does\ work\ for\ you!

###\ Duplicated\ files\ ###

Sometimes,\ for\ no\ reason\ I\[aq]ve\ been\ able\ to\ track\ down,\ drive\ will
duplicate\ a\ file\ that\ rclone\ uploads.\ \ Drive\ unlike\ all\ the\ other
remotes\ can\ have\ duplicated\ files.

Duplicated\ files\ cause\ problems\ with\ the\ syncing\ and\ you\ will\ see
messages\ in\ the\ log\ about\ duplicates.

Use\ `rclone\ dedupe`\ to\ fix\ duplicated\ files.

Note\ that\ this\ isn\[aq]t\ just\ a\ problem\ with\ rclone,\ even\ Google\ Photos\ on
Android\ duplicates\ files\ on\ drive\ sometimes.

###\ Rclone\ appears\ to\ be\ re\-copying\ files\ it\ shouldn\[aq]t\ ###

The\ most\ likely\ cause\ of\ this\ is\ the\ duplicated\ file\ issue\ above\ \-\ run
`rclone\ dedupe`\ and\ check\ your\ logs\ for\ duplicate\ object\ or\ directory
messages.

This\ can\ also\ be\ caused\ by\ a\ delay/caching\ on\ google\ drive\[aq]s\ end\ when
comparing\ directory\ listings.\ Specifically\ with\ team\ drives\ used\ in
combination\ with\ \-\-fast\-list.\ Files\ that\ were\ uploaded\ recently\ may
not\ appear\ on\ the\ directory\ list\ sent\ to\ rclone\ when\ using\ \-\-fast\-list.

Waiting\ a\ moderate\ period\ of\ time\ between\ attempts\ (estimated\ to\ be
approximately\ 1\ hour)\ and/or\ not\ using\ \-\-fast\-list\ both\ seem\ to\ be
effective\ in\ preventing\ the\ problem.

###\ Making\ your\ own\ client_id\ ###

When\ you\ use\ rclone\ with\ Google\ drive\ in\ its\ default\ configuration\ you
are\ using\ rclone\[aq]s\ client_id.\ \ This\ is\ shared\ between\ all\ the\ rclone
users.\ \ There\ is\ a\ global\ rate\ limit\ on\ the\ number\ of\ queries\ per
second\ that\ each\ client_id\ can\ do\ set\ by\ Google.\ \ rclone\ already\ has\ a
high\ quota\ and\ I\ will\ continue\ to\ make\ sure\ it\ is\ high\ enough\ by
contacting\ Google.

It\ is\ strongly\ recommended\ to\ use\ your\ own\ client\ ID\ as\ the\ default\ rclone\ ID\ is\ heavily\ used.\ If\ you\ have\ multiple\ services\ running,\ it\ is\ recommended\ to\ use\ an\ API\ key\ for\ each\ service.\ The\ default\ Google\ quota\ is\ 10\ transactions\ per\ second\ so\ it\ is\ recommended\ to\ stay\ under\ that\ number\ as\ if\ you\ use\ more\ than\ that,\ it\ will\ cause\ rclone\ to\ rate\ limit\ and\ make\ things\ slower.

Here\ is\ how\ to\ create\ your\ own\ Google\ Drive\ client\ ID\ for\ rclone:

1.\ Log\ into\ the\ [Google\ API
Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)\ with\ your\ Google
account.\ It\ doesn\[aq]t\ matter\ what\ Google\ account\ you\ use.\ (It\ need\ not
be\ the\ same\ account\ as\ the\ Google\ Drive\ you\ want\ to\ access)

2.\ Select\ a\ project\ or\ create\ a\ new\ project.

3.\ Under\ "ENABLE\ APIS\ AND\ SERVICES"\ search\ for\ "Drive",\ and\ enable\ the
"Google\ Drive\ API".

4.\ Click\ "Credentials"\ in\ the\ left\-side\ panel\ (not\ "Create
credentials",\ which\ opens\ the\ wizard),\ then\ "Create\ credentials",\ then
"OAuth\ client\ ID".\ \ It\ will\ prompt\ you\ to\ set\ the\ OAuth\ consent\ screen
product\ name,\ if\ you\ haven\[aq]t\ set\ one\ already.

5.\ Choose\ an\ application\ type\ of\ "other",\ and\ click\ "Create".\ (the
default\ name\ is\ fine)

6.\ It\ will\ show\ you\ a\ client\ ID\ and\ client\ secret.\ \ Use\ these\ values
in\ rclone\ config\ to\ add\ a\ new\ remote\ or\ edit\ an\ existing\ remote.

The\ rclone\ backend\ for\ [Google\ Photos](https://www.google.com/photos/about/)\ is
a\ specialized\ backend\ for\ transferring\ photos\ and\ videos\ to\ and\ from
Google\ Photos.

**NB**\ The\ Google\ Photos\ API\ which\ rclone\ uses\ has\ quite\ a\ few
limitations,\ so\ please\ read\ the\ [limitations\ section](#limitations)
carefully\ to\ make\ sure\ it\ is\ suitable\ for\ your\ use.

##\ Configuring\ Google\ Photos

The\ initial\ setup\ for\ google\ cloud\ storage\ involves\ getting\ a\ token\ from\ Google\ Photos
which\ you\ need\ to\ do\ in\ your\ browser.\ \ `rclone\ config`\ walks\ you
through\ it.

Here\ is\ an\ example\ of\ how\ to\ make\ a\ remote\ called\ `remote`.\ \ First\ run:

\ \ \ \ \ rclone\ config

This\ will\ guide\ you\ through\ an\ interactive\ setup\ process:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
No remotes found \- make a new one n) New remote s) Set configuration
password q) Quit config n/s/q> n name> remote Type of storage to
configure.
Enter a string value.
Press Enter for the default ("\[lq]). Choose a number from below, or
type in your own value [snip] XX / Google Photos \ \[rq]google photos"
[snip] Storage> google photos ** See help for google photos backend at:
https://rclone.org/googlephotos/ **
.PP
Google Application Client Id Leave blank normally.
Enter a string value.
Press Enter for the default ("\[lq]). client_id> Google Application
Client Secret Leave blank normally. Enter a string value. Press Enter
for the default (\[rq]").
client_secret> Set to make the Google Photos backend read only.
.PP
If you choose read only then rclone will only request read only access
to your photos, otherwise rclone will request full access.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[] and this may require you to
unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall, or use manual
mode.
T}
T{
This remote is called \f[C]remote\f[] and can now be used like this
T}
T{
See all the albums in your photos
T}
T{
rclone lsd remote:album
T}
T{
Make a new album
T}
T{
rclone mkdir remote:album/newAlbum
T}
T{
List the contents of an album
T}
T{
rclone ls remote:album/newAlbum
T}
T{
Sync \f[C]/home/local/images\f[] to the Google Photos, removing any
excess files in the album.
T}
T{
rclone sync /home/local/image remote:album/newAlbum
T}
T{
## Layout
T}
T{
As Google Photos is not a general purpose cloud storage system the
backend is laid out to help you navigate it.
T}
T{
The directories under \f[C]media\f[] show different ways of categorizing
the media.
Each file will appear multiple times.
So if you want to make a backup of your google photos you might choose
to backup \f[C]remote:media/by\-month\f[].
(\f[B]NB\f[] \f[C]remote:media/by\-day\f[] is rather slow at the moment
so avoid for syncing.)
T}
T{
Note that all your photos and videos will appear somewhere under
\f[C]media\f[], but they may not appear under \f[C]album\f[] unless
you've put them into albums.
T}
T{
\f[C]/\ \-\ upload\ \-\ file1.jpg\ \-\ file2.jpg\ \-\ ...\ \-\ media\ \-\ all\ \-\ file1.jpg\ \-\ file2.jpg\ \-\ ...\ \-\ by\-year\ \-\ 2000\ \-\ file1.jpg\ \-\ ...\ \-\ 2001\ \-\ file2.jpg\ \-\ ...\ \-\ ...\ \-\ by\-month\ \-\ 2000\ \-\ 2000\-01\ \-\ file1.jpg\ \-\ ...\ \-\ 2000\-02\ \-\ file2.jpg\ \-\ ...\ \-\ ...\ \-\ by\-day\ \-\ 2000\ \-\ 2000\-01\-01\ \-\ file1.jpg\ \-\ ...\ \-\ 2000\-01\-02\ \-\ file2.jpg\ \-\ ...\ \-\ ...\ \-\ album\ \-\ album\ name\ \-\ album\ name/sub\ \-\ shared\-album\ \-\ album\ name\ \-\ album\ name/sub\f[]
T}
T{
There are two writable parts of the tree, the \f[C]upload\f[] directory
and sub directories of the the \f[C]album\f[] directory.
T}
T{
The \f[C]upload\f[] directory is for uploading files you don't want to
put into albums.
This will be empty to start with and will contain the files you've
uploaded for one rclone session only, becoming empty again when you
restart rclone.
The use case for this would be if you have a load of files you just want
to once off dump into Google Photos.
For repeated syncing, uploading to \f[C]album\f[] will work better.
T}
T{
Directories within the \f[C]album\f[] directory are also writeable and
you may create new directories (albums) under \f[C]album\f[].
If you copy files with a directory hierarchy in there then rclone will
create albums with the \f[C]/\f[] character in them.
For example if you do
T}
T{
rclone copy /path/to/images remote:album/images
T}
T{
and the images directory contains
T}
T{
\f[C]images\ \-\ file1.jpg\ dir\ file2.jpg\ dir2\ dir3\ file3.jpg\f[]
T}
T{
Then rclone will create the following albums with the following files in
T}
T{
\- images \- file1.jpg \- images/dir \- file2.jpg \- images/dir2/dir3 \-
file3.jpg
T}
T{
This means that you can use the \f[C]album\f[] path pretty much like a
normal filesystem and it is a good target for repeated syncing.
T}
T{
The \f[C]shared\-album\f[] directory shows albums shared with you or by
you.
This is similar to the Sharing tab in the Google Photos web interface.
T}
T{
## Limitations
T}
T{
Only images and videos can be uploaded.
If you attempt to upload non videos or images or formats that Google
Photos doesn't understand, rclone will upload the file, then Google
Photos will give an error when it is put turned into a media item.
T}
T{
Note that all media items uploaded to Google Photos through the API are
stored in full resolution at \[lq]original quality\[rq] and
\f[B]will\f[] count towards your storage quota in your Google Account.
The API does \f[B]not\f[] offer a way to upload in \[lq]high
quality\[rq] mode..
T}
T{
### Downloading Images
T}
T{
When Images are downloaded this strips EXIF location (according to the
docs and my tests).
This is a limitation of the Google Photos API and is covered by bug
#112096115 (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/112096115).
T}
T{
\f[B]The current google API does not allow photos to be downloaded at
original resolution. This is very important if you are, for example,
relying on \[lq]Google Photos\[rq] as a backup of your photos. You will
not be able to use rclone to redownload original images. You could use
`google takeout' to recover the original photos as a last resort\f[]
T}
T{
### Downloading Videos
T}
T{
When videos are downloaded they are downloaded in a really compressed
version of the video compared to downloading it via the Google Photos
web interface.
This is covered by bug
#113672044 (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/113672044).
T}
T{
### Duplicates
T}
T{
If a file name is duplicated in a directory then rclone will add the
file ID into its name.
So two files called \f[C]file.jpg\f[] would then appear as
\f[C]file\ {123456}.jpg\f[] and \f[C]file\ {ABCDEF}.jpg\f[] (the actual
IDs are a lot longer alas!).
T}
T{
If you upload the same image (with the same binary data) twice then
Google Photos will deduplicate it.
However it will retain the filename from the first upload which may
confuse rclone.
For example if you uploaded an image to \f[C]upload\f[] then uploaded
the same image to \f[C]album/my_album\f[] the filename of the image in
\f[C]album/my_album\f[] will be what it was uploaded with initially, not
what you uploaded it with to \f[C]album\f[].
In practise this shouldn't cause too many problems.
T}
T{
### Modified time
T}
T{
The date shown of media in Google Photos is the creation date as
determined by the EXIF information, or the upload date if that is not
known.
T}
T{
This is not changeable by rclone and is not the modification date of the
media on local disk.
This means that rclone cannot use the dates from Google Photos for
syncing purposes.
T}
T{
### Size
T}
T{
The Google Photos API does not return the size of media.
This means that when syncing to Google Photos, rclone can only do a file
existence check.
T}
T{
It is possible to read the size of the media, but this needs an extra
HTTP HEAD request per media item so is \f[B]very slow\f[] and uses up a
lot of transactions.
This can be enabled with the \f[C]\-\-gphotos\-read\-size\f[] option or
the \f[C]read_size\ =\ true\f[] config parameter.
T}
T{
If you want to use the backend with \f[C]rclone\ mount\f[] you may need
to enable this flag (depending on your OS and application using the
photos) otherwise you may not be able to read media off the mount.
You'll need to experiment to see if it works for you without the flag.
T}
T{
### Albums
T}
T{
Rclone can only upload files to albums it created.
This is a limitation of the Google Photos
API (https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/manage-albums).
T}
T{
Rclone can remove files it uploaded from albums it created only.
T}
T{
### Deleting files
T}
T{
Rclone can remove files from albums it created, but note that the Google
Photos API does not allow media to be deleted permanently so this media
will still remain.
See bug #109759781 (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/109759781).
T}
T{
Rclone cannot delete files anywhere except under \f[C]album\f[].
T}
T{
### Deleting albums
T}
T{
The Google Photos API does not support deleting albums \- see bug
#135714733 (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/135714733).
T}
T{
 ### Standard Options

Google Application Client Secret Leave blank normally.
T}
T{
\- Config: client_secret \- Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_CLIENT_SECRET \-

T}
T{
#### \[en]gphotos\-read\-only
T}
T{
Set to make the Google Photos backend read only.
T}
T{
If you choose read only then rclone will only request read only access
to your photos, otherwise rclone will request full access.
T}
T{
\- Config: read_only \- Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_READ_ONLY \- Type: bool
\- Default: false
T}
T{
### Advanced Options
T}
T{
Here are the advanced options specific to google photos (Google Photos).
T}
T{
#### \[en]gphotos\-read\-size
T}
T{
Set to read the size of media items.
T}
T{
Normally rclone does not read the size of media items since this takes
another transaction.
This isn't necessary for syncing.
However rclone mount needs to know the size of files in advance of
reading them, so setting this flag when using rclone mount is
recommended if you want to read the media.
T}
T{
\- Config: read_size \- Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_READ_SIZE \- Type: bool
\- Default: false
T}

HTTP

.TE
.PP
The HTTP remote is a read only remote for reading files of a webserver.
The webserver should provide file listings which rclone will read and
turn into a remote.
This has been tested with common webservers such as Apache/Nginx/Caddy
and will likely work with file listings from most web servers.

.PP
A / on the end of a path is how rclone normally tells the difference
between files and directories.
If this flag is set, then rclone will treat all files with
Content\-Type: text/html as directories and read URLs from them rather
than downloading them.
.PP
Note that this may cause rclone to confuse genuine HTML files with
directories.

When doing streaming uploads (eg using rcat or mount) setting this flag
will cause the swift backend to not upload chunked files.

.SS Devices and Mountpoints
.PP
The official Jottacloud client registers a device for each computer you
install it on and then creates a mountpoint for each folder you select
for Backup.
The web interface uses a special device called Jotta for the Archive,
Sync and Shared mountpoints.
In most cases you'll want to use the Jotta/Archive device/mounpoint
however if you want to access files uploaded by the official rclone
provides the option to select other devices and mountpoints during
config.
.SS \[en]fast\-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] which allows you to use
fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (/docs/#fast-list) for more details.
.PP
Note that the implementation in Jottacloud always uses only a single API
request to get the entire list, so for large folders this could lead to
long wait time before the first results are shown.
.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
Jottacloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
.PP
Jottacloud supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.PP
Note that Jottacloud requires the MD5 hash before upload so if the
source does not have an MD5 checksum then the file will be cached
temporarily on disk (wherever the \f[C]TMPDIR\f[] environment variable
points to) before it is uploaded.
Small files will be cached in memory \- see the
\f[C]\-\-jottacloud\-md5\-memory\-limit\f[] flag.
.SS Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters
set (/overview/#restricted-characters) the following characters are also

.PP
Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be replaced (/overview/#invalid-utf8), as
they can't be used in XML strings.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
By default rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files.
Due to a lack of API documentation emptying the trash is currently only
possible via the Jottacloud website.
If deleting permanently is required then use the
\f[C]\-\-jottacloud\-hard\-delete\f[] flag, or set the equivalent
environment variable.
.SS Versions
.PP
Jottacloud supports file versioning.
When rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a new version of
it.
Currently rclone only supports retrieving the current version but older
versions can be accessed via the Jottacloud Website.
.SS Quota information
.PP
To view your current quota you can use the
\f[C]rclone\ about\ remote:\f[] command which will display your usage
limit (unless it is unlimited) and the current usage.
.SS Device IDs
.PP
Jottacloud requires each `device' to be registered.
Rclone brings such a registration to easily access your account but if
you want to use Jottacloud together with rclone on multiple machines you
NEED to create a seperate deviceID/deviceSecrect on each machine.
You will asked during setting up the remote.
Please be aware that this also means that copying the rclone config from
one machine to another does NOT work with Jottacloud accounts.
You have to create it on each machine.
.SS Advanced Options
.PP
Here are the advanced options specific to jottacloud (JottaCloud).
.SS \[en]jottacloud\-md5\-memory\-limit

.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Jottacloud is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
\[lq]Hello.doc\[rq] and one called \[lq]hello.doc\[rq].
.PP
There are quite a few characters that can't be in Jottacloud file names.
Rclone will map these names to and from an identical looking unicode
equivalent.
For example if a file has a ?
in it will be mapped to ？ instead.
.PP
Jottacloud only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.
.SS Troubleshooting
.PP
Jottacloud exhibits some inconsistent behaviours regarding deleted files
and folders which may cause Copy, Move and DirMove operations to
previously deleted paths to fail.
Emptying the trash should help in such cases.
.SS Koofr
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[].
.PP
The initial setup for Koofr involves creating an application password
for rclone.
You can do that by opening the Koofr web
application (https://app.koofr.net/app/admin/preferences/password),
giving the password a nice name like \f[C]rclone\f[] and clicking on
generate.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]koofr\f[].

.SS Mail.ru Cloud
.PP
Mail.ru Cloud (https://cloud.mail.ru/) is a cloud storage provided by a
Russian internet company Mail.Ru Group (https://mail.ru).
The official desktop client is Disk\-O: (https://disk-o.cloud/),
available only on Windows.
(Please note that official sites are in Russian)
.SS Features highlights
.IP \[bu] 2
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[]

Configuration of this backend does not require a local web browser.
You can use the configured backend as shown below:
.PP
See top level directories
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ lsd\ remote:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Make a new directory
.IP

excess files in the path.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ /home/local/directory\ remote:directory
\f[]
.fi
.SS Modified time
.PP
Files support a modification time attribute with up to 1 second
precision.
Directories do not have a modification time, which is shown as \[lq]Jan
1 1970\[rq].
.SS Hash checksums
.PP
Hash sums use a custom Mail.ru algorithm based on SHA1.
If file size is less than or equal to the SHA1 block size (20 bytes),
its hash is simply its data right\-padded with zero bytes.
Hash sum of a larger file is computed as a SHA1 sum of the file data
bytes concatenated with a decimal representation of the data length.
.SS Emptying Trash
.PP
Removing a file or directory actually moves it to the trash, which is
not visible to rclone but can be seen in a web browser.
The trashed file still occupies part of total quota.
If you wish to empty your trash and free some quota, you can use the
\f[C]rclone\ cleanup\ remote:\f[] command, which will permanently delete
all your trashed files.
This command does not take any path arguments.
.SS Quota information
.PP
To view your current quota you can use the
\f[C]rclone\ about\ remote:\f[] command which will display your usage
limit (quota) and the current usage.

File size limits depend on your account.
A single file size is limited by 2G for a free account and unlimited for
paid tariffs.
Please refer to the Mail.ru site for the total uploaded size limits.

It is especially efficient in case of generally available files like
popular books, video or audio clips, because files are searched by hash
in all accounts of all mailru users.
Please note that rclone may need local memory and disk space to
calculate content hash in advance and decide whether full upload is
required.
Also, if rclone does not know file size in advance (e.g.\ in case of
streaming or partial uploads), it will not even try this optimization.

.SS Mega
.PP
Mega (https://mega.nz/) is a cloud storage and file hosting service
known for its security feature where all files are encrypted locally
before they are uploaded.
This prevents anyone (including employees of Mega) from accessing the
files without knowledge of the key used for encryption.
.PP
This is an rclone backend for Mega which supports the file transfer
features of Mega using the same client side encryption.
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[].
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[].
First run:
.IP

\f[B]NOTE:\f[] The encryption keys need to have been already generated
after a regular login via the browser, otherwise attempting to use the

.PP
Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be replaced (/overview/#invalid-utf8), as
they can't be used in JSON strings.
.SS Duplicated files
.PP
Mega can have two files with exactly the same name and path (unlike a
normal file system).
.PP
Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.
.PP
Use \f[C]rclone\ dedupe\f[] to fix duplicated files.
.SS Failure to log\-in
.PP
Mega remotes seem to get blocked (reject logins) under \[lq]heavy
use\[rq].
We haven't worked out the exact blocking rules but it seems to be
related to fast paced, sucessive rclone commands.
.PP
For example, executing this command 90 times in a row
\f[C]rclone\ link\ remote:file\f[] will cause the remote to become
\[lq]blocked\[rq].
This is not an abnormal situation, for example if you wish to get the
public links of a directory with hundred of files\&... After more or
less a week, the remote will remote accept rclone logins normally again.
.PP
You can mitigate this issue by mounting the remote it with
\f[C]rclone\ mount\f[].
This will log\-in when mounting and a log\-out when unmounting only.
You can also run \f[C]rclone\ rcd\f[] and then use \f[C]rclone\ rc\f[]
to run the commands over the API to avoid logging in each time.
.PP
Rclone does not currently close mega sessions (you can see them in the
web interface), however closing the sessions does not solve the issue.
.PP
If you space rclone commands by 3 seconds it will avoid blocking the
remote.
We haven't identified the exact blocking rules, so perhaps one could
execute the command 80 times without waiting and avoid blocking by
waiting 3 seconds, then continuing\&...
.PP
Note that this has been observed by trial and error and might not be set
in stone.
.PP
Other tools seem not to produce this blocking effect, as they use a
different working approach (state\-based, using sessionIDs instead of
log\-in) which isn't compatible with the current stateless rclone
approach.
.PP
Note that once blocked, the use of other tools (such as megacmd) is not
a sure workaround: following megacmd login times have been observed in
sucession for blocked remote: 7 minutes, 20 min, 30min, 30 min, 30min.
Web access looks unaffected though.
.PP
Investigation is continuing in relation to workarounds based on
timeouts, pacers, retrials and tpslimits \- if you discover something
relevant, please post on the forum.
.PP
So, if rclone was working nicely and suddenly you are unable to log\-in
and you are sure the user and the password are correct, likely you have
got the remote blocked for a while.
.SS Standard Options

than permanently deleting them.
If you specify this then rclone will permanently delete objects instead.

Config: hard_delete
.IP \[bu] 2
Env Var: RCLONE_MEGA_HARD_DELETE
.IP \[bu] 2
Type: bool
.IP \[bu] 2
Default: false
.SS Limitations
.PP
This backend uses the go\-mega go
library (https://github.com/t3rm1n4l/go-mega) which is an opensource go
library implementing the Mega API.
There doesn't appear to be any documentation for the mega protocol
beyond the mega C++ SDK (https://github.com/meganz/sdk) source code so
there are likely quite a few errors still remaining in this library.
.PP
Mega allows duplicate files which may confuse rclone.
.SS Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:container\f[] (or \f[C]remote:\f[]
for the \f[C]lsd\f[] command.) You may put subdirectories in too, eg
\f[C]remote:container/path/to/dir\f[].
.PP
Here is an example of making a Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
configuration.
For a remote called \f[C]remote\f[].
First run:

.SS \[en]fast\-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] which allows you to use
fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (/docs/#fast-list) for more details.
.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object with the
\f[C]mtime\f[] key.
It is stored using RFC3339 Format time with nanosecond precision.
The metadata is supplied during directory listings so there is no
overhead to using it.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
In addition to the default restricted characters
set (/overview/#restricted-characters) the following characters are also
replaced:

.PP
Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be replaced (/overview/#invalid-utf8), as
they can't be used in JSON strings.
.SS Hashes
.PP
MD5 hashes are stored with blobs.
However blobs that were uploaded in chunks only have an MD5 if the
source remote was capable of MD5 hashes, eg the local disk.
.SS Authenticating with Azure Blob Storage
.PP
Rclone has 3 ways of authenticating with Azure Blob Storage:
.SS Account and Key
.PP
This is the most straight forward and least flexible way.
Just fill in the \f[C]account\f[] and \f[C]key\f[] lines and leave the
rest blank.
.SS SAS URL
.PP
This can be an account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL
.PP
To use it leave \f[C]account\f[], \f[C]key\f[] blank and fill in
\f[C]sas_url\f[].
.PP
Account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL can be obtained from
Azure portal or Azure Storage Explorer.
To get a container level SAS URL right click on a container in the Azure
Blob explorer in the Azure portal.
.PP
If You use container level SAS URL, rclone operations are permitted only
on particular container, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ ls\ azureblob:container\ or\ rclone\ ls\ azureblob:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Since container name already exists in SAS URL, you can leave it empty
as well.
.PP
However these will not work
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ lsd\ azureblob:
rclone\ ls\ azureblob:othercontainer
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This would be useful for temporarily allowing third parties access to a
single container or putting credentials into an untrusted environment.
.SS Multipart uploads
.PP
Rclone supports multipart uploads with Azure Blob storage.
Files bigger than 256MB will be uploaded using chunked upload by
default.
.PP
The files will be uploaded in parallel in 4MB chunks (by default).
Note that these chunks are buffered in memory and there may be up to
\f[C]\-\-transfers\f[] of them being uploaded at once.
.PP
Files can't be split into more than 50,000 chunks so by default, so the
largest file that can be uploaded with 4MB chunk size is 195GB.
Above this rclone will double the chunk size until it creates less than
50,000 chunks.
By default this will mean a maximum file size of 3.2TB can be uploaded.
This can be raised to 5TB using
\f[C]\-\-azureblob\-chunk\-size\ 100M\f[].
.PP
Note that rclone doesn't commit the block list until the end of the
upload which means that there is a limit of 9.5TB of multipart uploads
in progress as Azure won't allow more than that amount of uncommitted
blocks.

.PP
If there is no \[lq]access tier\[rq] specified, rclone doesn't apply any
tier.
rclone performs \[lq]Set Tier\[rq] operation on blobs while uploading,
if objects are not modified, specifying \[lq]access tier\[rq] to new one
will have no effect.
If blobs are in \[lq]archive tier\[rq] at remote, trying to perform data
transfer operations from remote will not be allowed.

See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Microsoft.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[] like this,
.PP
List directories in top level of your OneDrive
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ lsd\ remote:
\f[]
.fi
.PP

.SS Getting your own Client ID and Key
.PP
rclone uses a pair of Client ID and Key shared by all rclone users when
performing requests by default.
If you are having problems with them (E.g., seeing a lot of throttling),
you can get your own Client ID and Key by following the steps below:
.IP "1." 3
Open
https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade,
then click \f[C]New\ registration\f[].
.IP "2." 3
Enter a name for your app, choose your account type, select \f[C]Web\f[]
in \f[C]Redirect\ URI\f[] Enter \f[C]http://localhost:53682/\f[] and
click Register.
Copy and keep the \f[C]Application\ (client)\ ID\f[] under the app name
for later use.
.IP "3." 3
Under \f[C]manage\f[] select \f[C]Certificates\ &\ secrets\f[], click
\f[C]New\ client\ secret\f[].
Copy and keep that secret for later use.
.IP "4." 3
Under \f[C]manage\f[] select \f[C]API\ permissions\f[], click
\f[C]Add\ a\ permission\f[] and select \f[C]Microsoft\ Graph\f[] then
select \f[C]delegated\ permissions\f[].
.IP "5." 3
Search and select the follwing permssions: \f[C]Files.Read\f[],
\f[C]Files.ReadWrite\f[], \f[C]Files.Read.All\f[],
\f[C]Files.ReadWrite.All\f[], \f[C]offline_access\f[],
\f[C]User.Read\f[].
Once selected click \f[C]Add\ permissions\f[] at the bottom.
.PP
Now the application is complete.
Run \f[C]rclone\ config\f[] to create or edit a OneDrive remote.
Supply the app ID and password as Client ID and Secret, respectively.
rclone will walk you through the remaining steps.
.SS Modification time and hashes
.PP
OneDrive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
.PP
OneDrive personal supports SHA1 type hashes.
OneDrive for business and Sharepoint Server support
QuickXorHash (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/code-snippets/quickxorhash).
.PP
For all types of OneDrive you can use the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.

Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be replaced (/overview/#invalid-utf8), as
they can't be used in JSON strings.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.
Microsoft doesn't provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to
empty the trash, so you will have to do that with one of Microsoft's
apps or via the OneDrive website.
.SS Standard Options

.SS \[en]onedrive\-expose\-onenote\-files
.PP
Set to make OneNote files show up in directory listings.
.PP
By default rclone will hide OneNote files in directory listings because
operations like \[lq]Open\[rq] and \[lq]Update\[rq] won't work on them.
But this behaviour may also prevent you from deleting them.
If you want to delete OneNote files or otherwise want them to show up in
directory listing, set this option.

Default: false
.SS Limitations
.SS Naming
.PP
Note that OneDrive is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
\[lq]Hello.doc\[rq] and one called \[lq]hello.doc\[rq].
.PP
There are quite a few characters that can't be in OneDrive file names.
These can't occur on Windows platforms, but on non\-Windows platforms
they are common.
Rclone will map these names to and from an identical looking unicode
equivalent.
For example if a file has a \f[C]?\f[] in it will be mapped to
\f[C]？\f[] instead.
.SS File sizes
.PP
The largest allowed file sizes are 15GB for OneDrive for Business and
35GB for OneDrive Personal (Updated 4 Jan 2019).
.SS Path length
.PP
The entire path, including the file name, must contain fewer than 400
characters for OneDrive, OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online.
If you are encrypting file and folder names with rclone, you may want to
pay attention to this limitation because the encrypted names are
typically longer than the original ones.
.SS Number of files
.PP
OneDrive seems to be OK with at least 50,000 files in a folder, but at
100,000 rclone will get errors listing the directory like
\f[C]couldn't\ list\ files:\ UnknownError:\f[].
See #2707 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2707) for more info.
.PP
An official document about the limitations for different types of
OneDrive can be found
here (https://support.office.com/en-us/article/invalid-file-names-and-file-types-in-onedrive-onedrive-for-business-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa).
.SS Versioning issue
.PP
Every change in OneDrive causes the service to create a new version.
This counts against a users quota.
For example changing the modification time of a file creates a second
version, so the file is using twice the space.
.PP
The \f[C]copy\f[] is the only rclone command affected by this as we copy
the file and then afterwards set the modification time to match the
source file.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[]: Starting October 2018, users will no longer be able to
disable versioning by default.
This is because Microsoft has brought an
update (https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-OneDrive-Blog/New-Updates-to-OneDrive-and-SharePoint-Team-Site-Versioning/ba-p/204390)
to the mechanism.
To change this new default setting, a PowerShell command is required to
be run by a SharePoint admin.
If you are an admin, you can run these commands in PowerShell to change
that setting:
.IP "1." 3
\f[C]Install\-Module\ \-Name\ Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell\f[]
(in case you haven't installed this already)
.IP "2." 3
\f[C]Import\-Module\ Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell\ \-DisableNameChecking\f[]
.IP "3." 3
\f[C]Connect\-SPOService\ \-Url\ https://YOURSITE\-admin.sharepoint.com\ \-Credential\ YOU\@YOURSITE.COM\f[]
(replacing \f[C]YOURSITE\f[], \f[C]YOU\f[], \f[C]YOURSITE.COM\f[] with
the actual values; this will prompt for your credentials)
.IP "4." 3
\f[C]Set\-SPOTenant\ \-EnableMinimumVersionRequirement\ $False\f[]
.IP "5." 3
\f[C]Disconnect\-SPOService\f[] (to disconnect from the server)
.PP
\f[I]Below are the steps for normal users to disable versioning. If you
don't see the \[lq]No Versioning\[rq] option, make sure the above
requirements are met.\f[]
.PP
User Weropol (https://github.com/Weropol) has found a method to disable
versioning on OneDrive
.IP "1." 3
Open the settings menu by clicking on the gear symbol at the top of the
OneDrive Business page.
.IP "2." 3
Click Site settings.
.IP "3." 3
Once on the Site settings page, navigate to Site Administration > Site
libraries and lists.
.IP "4." 3
Click Customize \[lq]Documents\[rq].
.IP "5." 3
Click General Settings > Versioning Settings.
.IP "6." 3
Under Document Version History select the option No versioning.
Note: This will disable the creation of new file versions, but will not
remove any previous versions.
Your documents are safe.
.IP "7." 3
Apply the changes by clicking OK.
.IP "8." 3
Use rclone to upload or modify files.
(I also use the \[en]no\-update\-modtime flag)
.IP "9." 3
Restore the versioning settings after using rclone.

.SS Troubleshooting
.SS Unexpected file size/hash differences on Sharepoint
.PP
It is a
known (https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs/issues/935#issuecomment-441741631)
issue that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for Business) silently
modifies uploaded files, mainly Office files (.docx, .xlsx, etc.),
causing file size and hash checks to fail.
To use rclone with such affected files on Sharepoint, you may disable
these checks with the following command line arguments:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-ignore\-checksum\ \-\-ignore\-size
\f[]
.fi
.SS Replacing/deleting existing files on Sharepoint gets \[lq]item not
found\[rq]
.PP
It is a
known (https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs/issues/1068) issue
that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for Business) may return
\[lq]item not found\[rq] errors when users try to replace or delete
uploaded files; this seems to mainly affect Office files (.docx, .xlsx,
etc.).
As a workaround, you may use the \f[C]\-\-backup\-dir\ <BACKUP_DIR>\f[]
command line argument so rclone moves the files to be replaced/deleted
into a given backup directory (instead of directly replacing/deleting
them).
For example, to instruct rclone to move the files into the directory
\f[C]rclone\-backup\-dir\f[] on backend \f[C]mysharepoint\f[], you may
use:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-backup\-dir\ mysharepoint:rclone\-backup\-dir
\f[]
.fi
.SS access_denied (AADSTS65005)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Error:\ access_denied
Code:\ AADSTS65005
Description:\ Using\ application\ \[aq]rclone\[aq]\ is\ currently\ not\ supported\ for\ your\ organization\ [YOUR_ORGANIZATION]\ because\ it\ is\ in\ an\ unmanaged\ state.\ An\ administrator\ needs\ to\ claim\ ownership\ of\ the\ company\ by\ DNS\ validation\ of\ [YOUR_ORGANIZATION]\ before\ the\ application\ rclone\ can\ be\ provisioned.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This means that rclone can't use the OneDrive for Business API with your
account.
You can't do much about it, maybe write an email to your admins.
.PP
However, there are other ways to interact with your OneDrive account.
Have a look at the webdav backend: https://rclone.org/webdav/#sharepoint
.SS invalid_grant (AADSTS50076)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Error:\ invalid_grant
Code:\ AADSTS50076
Description:\ Due\ to\ a\ configuration\ change\ made\ by\ your\ administrator,\ or\ because\ you\ moved\ to\ a\ new\ location,\ you\ must\ use\ multi\-factor\ authentication\ to\ access\ \[aq]...\[aq].
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you see the error above after enabling multi\-factor authentication
for your account, you can fix it by refreshing your OAuth refresh token.
To do that, run \f[C]rclone\ config\f[], and choose to edit your
OneDrive backend.
Then, you don't need to actually make any changes until you reach this
question: \f[C]Already\ have\ a\ token\ \-\ refresh?\f[].
For this question, answer \f[C]y\f[] and go through the process to
refresh your token, just like the first time the backend is configured.
After this, rclone should work again for this backend.

.SS Configuration from an OpenStack credentials file
.PP
An OpenStack credentials file typically looks something something like
this (without the comments)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export\ OS_AUTH_URL=https://a.provider.net/v2.0
export\ OS_TENANT_ID=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
export\ OS_TENANT_NAME="1234567890123456"
export\ OS_USERNAME="123abc567xy"
echo\ "Please\ enter\ your\ OpenStack\ Password:\ "
read\ \-sr\ OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
export\ OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
export\ OS_REGION_NAME="SBG1"
if\ [\ \-z\ "$OS_REGION_NAME"\ ];\ then\ unset\ OS_REGION_NAME;\ fi
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The config file needs to look something like this where
\f[C]$OS_USERNAME\f[] represents the value of the \f[C]OS_USERNAME\f[]
variable \- \f[C]123abc567xy\f[] in the example above.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[remote]
type\ =\ swift
user\ =\ $OS_USERNAME
key\ =\ $OS_PASSWORD
auth\ =\ $OS_AUTH_URL
tenant\ =\ $OS_TENANT_NAME
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that you may (or may not) need to set \f[C]region\f[] too \- try
without first.
.SS Configuration from the environment
.PP
If you prefer you can configure rclone to use swift using a standard set
of OpenStack environment variables.
.PP
When you run through the config, make sure you choose \f[C]true\f[] for
\f[C]env_auth\f[] and leave everything else blank.
.PP
rclone will then set any empty config parameters from the environment
using standard OpenStack environment variables.
There is a list of the
variables (https://godoc.org/github.com/ncw/swift#Connection.ApplyEnvironment)
in the docs for the swift library.
.SS Using an alternate authentication method
.PP
If your OpenStack installation uses a non\-standard authentication
method that might not be yet supported by rclone or the underlying swift
library, you can authenticate externally (e.g.\ calling manually the
\f[C]openstack\f[] commands to get a token).
Then, you just need to pass the two configuration variables
\f[C]auth_token\f[] and \f[C]storage_url\f[].
If they are both provided, the other variables are ignored.
rclone will not try to authenticate but instead assume it is already
authenticated and use these two variables to access the OpenStack
installation.
.SS Using rclone without a config file
.PP
You can use rclone with swift without a config file, if desired, like
this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
source\ openstack\-credentials\-file
export\ RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_TYPE=swift
export\ RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_ENV_AUTH=true
rclone\ lsd\ myremote:
\f[]
.fi
.SS \[en]fast\-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]\-\-fast\-list\f[] which allows you to use
fewer transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (/docs/#fast-list) for more details.
.SS \[en]update and \[en]use\-server\-modtime
.PP
As noted below, the modified time is stored on metadata on the object.
It is used by default for all operations that require checking the time
a file was last updated.
It allows rclone to treat the remote more like a true filesystem, but it
is inefficient because it requires an extra API call to retrieve the
metadata.
.PP
For many operations, the time the object was last uploaded to the remote
is sufficient to determine if it is \[lq]dirty\[rq].
By using \f[C]\-\-update\f[] along with
\f[C]\-\-use\-server\-modtime\f[], you can avoid the extra API call and
simply upload files whose local modtime is newer than the time it was
last uploaded.

.SS \[en]swift\-no\-chunk
.PP
Don't chunk files during streaming upload.
.PP
When doing streaming uploads (eg using rcat or mount) setting this flag
will cause the swift backend to not upload chunked files.
.PP
This will limit the maximum upload size to 5GB.
However non chunked files are easier to deal with and have an MD5SUM.
.PP
Rclone will still chunk files bigger than chunk_size when doing normal
copy operations.

.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X\-Object\-Meta\-Mtime\f[] as floating point since the epoch
accurate to 1 ns.
.PP
This is a defacto standard (used in the official python\-swiftclient

.PP
Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be replaced (/overview/#invalid-utf8), as
they can't be used in JSON strings.
.SS Limitations
.PP
The Swift API doesn't return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won't check or use the
MD5SUM for these.
.SS Troubleshooting
.SS Rclone gives Failed to create file system for \[lq]remote:\[rq]: Bad
Request
.PP
Due to an oddity of the underlying swift library, it gives a \[lq]Bad
Request\[rq] error rather than a more sensible error when the
authentication fails for Swift.
.PP
So this most likely means your username / password is wrong.
You can investigate further with the \f[C]\-\-dump\-bodies\f[] flag.
.PP
This may also be caused by specifying the region when you shouldn't have
(eg OVH).
.SS Rclone gives Failed to create file system: Response didn't have
storage storage url and auth token
.PP
This is most likely caused by forgetting to specify your tenant when
setting up a swift remote.
.SS pCloud
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[].
.PP
The initial setup for pCloud involves getting a token from pCloud which
you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone\ config\f[] walks you through it.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[].

See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from pCloud.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
pCloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
In order to set a Modification time pCloud requires the object be
re\-uploaded.
.PP
pCloud supports MD5 and SHA1 type hashes, so you can use the
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.SS Restricted filename characters

.SS SFTP
.PP
SFTP is the Secure (or SSH) File Transfer
Protocol (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol).
.PP
The SFTP backend can be used with a number of different providers:
.IP \[bu] 2
C14
.IP \[bu] 2
rsync.net
.PP
SFTP runs over SSH v2 and is installed as standard with most modern SSH
installations.
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[].
If the path does not begin with a \f[C]/\f[] it is relative to the home
directory of the user.
An empty path \f[C]remote:\f[] refers to the user's home directory.
.PP
"Note that some SFTP servers will need the leading / \- Synology is a
good example of this.
rsync.net, on the other hand, requires users to OMIT the leading /.
.PP
Here is an example of making an SFTP configuration.

\f[C]
rclone\ lsd\ remote:
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Make a new directory
.IP

.IP
.nf
\f[C]

any excess files in the directory.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ /home/local/directory\ remote:directory
\f[]
.fi
.SS SSH Authentication
.PP
The SFTP remote supports three authentication methods:
.IP \[bu] 2
Password
.IP \[bu] 2
Key file
.IP \[bu] 2
ssh\-agent
.PP
Key files should be PEM\-encoded private key files.
For instance \f[C]/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa\f[].
Only unencrypted OpenSSH or PEM encrypted files are supported.
.PP
If you don't specify \f[C]pass\f[] or \f[C]key_file\f[] then rclone will
attempt to contact an ssh\-agent.
.PP
You can also specify \f[C]key_use_agent\f[] to force the usage of an
ssh\-agent.
In this case \f[C]key_file\f[] can also be specified to force the usage
of a specific key in the ssh\-agent.
.PP
Using an ssh\-agent is the only way to load encrypted OpenSSH keys at
the moment.
.PP
If you set the \f[C]\-\-sftp\-ask\-password\f[] option, rclone will
prompt for a password when needed and no password has been configured.
.SS ssh\-agent on macOS
.PP
Note that there seem to be various problems with using an ssh\-agent on
macOS due to recent changes in the OS.
The most effective work\-around seems to be to start an ssh\-agent in
each session, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
eval\ `ssh\-agent\ \-s`\ &&\ ssh\-add\ \-A
\f[]
.fi
.PP
And then at the end of the session
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
eval\ `ssh\-agent\ \-k`
\f[]
.fi
.PP
These commands can be used in scripts of course.
.SS Modified time
.PP
Modified times are stored on the server to 1 second precision.
.PP
Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported.
.PP
Some SFTP servers disable setting/modifying the file modification time
after upload (for example, certain configurations of ProFTPd with
mod_sftp).
If you are using one of these servers, you can set the option
\f[C]set_modtime\ =\ false\f[] in your RClone backend configuration to
disable this behaviour.

SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and
\f[C]md5sum\f[] or \f[C]sha1sum\f[] as well as \f[C]echo\f[] are in the
remote's PATH.
This remote checksumming (file hashing) is recommended and enabled by
default.
Disabling the checksumming may be required if you are connecting to SFTP
servers which are not under your control, and to which the execution of
remote commands is prohibited.
Set the configuration option \f[C]disable_hashcheck\f[] to \f[C]true\f[]
to disable checksumming.
.PP
SFTP also supports \f[C]about\f[] if the same login has shell access and
\f[C]df\f[] are in the remote's PATH.
\f[C]about\f[] will return the total space, free space, and used space
on the remote for the disk of the specified path on the remote or, if
not set, the disk of the root on the remote.
\f[C]about\f[] will fail if it does not have shell access or if
\f[C]df\f[] is not in the remote's PATH.
.PP
Note that some SFTP servers (eg Synology) the paths are different for
SSH and SFTP so the hashes can't be calculated properly.
For them using \f[C]disable_hashcheck\f[] is a good idea.
.PP
The only ssh agent supported under Windows is Putty's pageant.
.PP
The Go SSH library disables the use of the aes128\-cbc cipher by
default, due to security concerns.
This can be re\-enabled on a per\-connection basis by setting the
\f[C]use_insecure_cipher\f[] setting in the configuration file to
\f[C]true\f[].
Further details on the insecurity of this cipher can be found [in this
paper] (http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/SandPfinal.pdf).

SFTP isn't supported under plan9 until this
issue (https://github.com/pkg/sftp/issues/156) is fixed.

Note that since SFTP isn't HTTP based the following flags don't work
with it: \f[C]\-\-dump\-headers\f[], \f[C]\-\-dump\-bodies\f[],
\f[C]\-\-dump\-auth\f[]
.PP
Note that \f[C]\-\-timeout\f[] isn't supported (but
\f[C]\-\-contimeout\f[] is).
.SS C14
.PP
C14 is supported through the SFTP backend.
.PP
See C14's
documentation (https://www.online.net/en/storage/c14-cold-storage)
.SS rsync.net

.SS Union
.PP
The \f[C]union\f[] remote provides a unification similar to UnionFS
using other remotes.
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required or a local path, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[] or
\f[C]/directory/subdirectory\f[].
.PP
During the initial setup with \f[C]rclone\ config\f[] you will specify
the target remotes as a space separated list.
The target remotes can either be a local paths or other remotes.
.PP
The order of the remotes is important as it defines which remotes take
precedence over others if there are files with the same name in the same
logical path.
The last remote is the topmost remote and replaces files with the same
name from previous remotes.
.PP
Only the last remote is used to write to and delete from, all other
remotes are read\-only.
.PP
Subfolders can be used in target remote.
Assume a union remote named \f[C]backup\f[] with the remotes
\f[C]mydrive:private/backup\ mydrive2:/backup\f[].
Invoking \f[C]rclone\ mkdir\ backup:desktop\f[] is exactly the same as
invoking \f[C]rclone\ mkdir\ mydrive2:/backup/desktop\f[].
.PP
There will be no special handling of paths containing \f[C]\&..\f[]
segments.
Invoking \f[C]rclone\ mkdir\ backup:../desktop\f[] is exactly the same
as invoking \f[C]rclone\ mkdir\ mydrive2:/backup/../desktop\f[].
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a union called \f[C]remote\f[] for
local folders.
First run:

Plain WebDAV does not support modified times.
However when used with Owncloud or Nextcloud rclone will support
modified times.
.PP
Likewise plain WebDAV does not support hashes, however when used with
Owncloud or Nextcloud rclone will support SHA1 and MD5 hashes.
Depending on the exact version of Owncloud or Nextcloud hashes may
appear on all objects, or only on objects which had a hash uploaded with
them.

.SS Provider notes
.PP
See below for notes on specific providers.
.SS Owncloud
.PP
Click on the settings cog in the bottom right of the page and this will
show the WebDAV URL that rclone needs in the config step.
It will look something like
\f[C]https://example.com/remote.php/webdav/\f[].
.PP
Owncloud supports modified times using the \f[C]X\-OC\-Mtime\f[] header.
.SS Nextcloud
.PP
This is configured in an identical way to Owncloud.
Note that Nextcloud does not support streaming of files (\f[C]rcat\f[])
whereas Owncloud does.
This may be
fixed (https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud-snap/issues/365) in the
future.
.SS Sharepoint
.PP
Rclone can be used with Sharepoint provided by OneDrive for Business or
Office365 Education Accounts.
This feature is only needed for a few of these Accounts, mostly
Office365 Education ones.
These accounts are sometimes not verified by the domain owner
github#1975 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1975)
.PP
This means that these accounts can't be added using the official API
(other Accounts should work with the \[lq]onedrive\[rq] option).
However, it is possible to access them using webdav.
.PP
To use a sharepoint remote with rclone, add it like this: First, you
need to get your remote's URL:
.IP \[bu] 2
Go here (https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/signin/) to open your
OneDrive or to sign in
.IP \[bu] 2
Now take a look at your address bar, the URL should look like this:
\f[C]https://[YOUR\-DOMAIN]\-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR\-EMAIL]/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx\f[]
.PP
You'll only need this URL upto the email address.
After that, you'll most likely want to add \[lq]/Documents\[rq].
That subdirectory contains the actual data stored on your OneDrive.
.PP
Add the remote to rclone like this: Configure the \f[C]url\f[] as
\f[C]https://[YOUR\-DOMAIN]\-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR\-EMAIL]/Documents\f[]
and use your normal account email and password for \f[C]user\f[] and
\f[C]pass\f[].
If you have 2FA enabled, you have to generate an app password.
Set the \f[C]vendor\f[] to \f[C]sharepoint\f[].
.PP
Your config file should look like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[sharepoint]
type\ =\ webdav
url\ =\ https://[YOUR\-DOMAIN]\-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR\-EMAIL]/Documents
vendor\ =\ other
user\ =\ YourEmailAddress
pass\ =\ encryptedpassword
\f[]
.fi
.SS Required Flags for SharePoint
.PP
As SharePoint does some special things with uploaded documents, you
won't be able to use the documents size or the documents hash to compare
if a file has been changed since the upload / which file is newer.
.PP
For Rclone calls copying files (especially Office files such as .docx,
\&.xlsx, etc.) from/to SharePoint (like copy, sync, etc.), you should
append these flags to ensure Rclone uses the \[lq]Last Modified\[rq]
datetime property to compare your documents:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-ignore\-size\ \-\-ignore\-checksum\ \-\-update
\f[]
.fi
.SS dCache
.PP
dCache is a storage system that supports many protocols and
authentication/authorisation schemes.
For WebDAV clients, it allows users to authenticate with username and
password (BASIC), X.509, Kerberos, and various bearer tokens, including
Macaroons (https://www.dcache.org/manuals/workshop-2017-05-29-Umea/000-Final/anupam_macaroons_v02.pdf)
and OpenID\-Connect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect)
access tokens.
.PP
Configure as normal using the \f[C]other\f[] type.
Don't enter a username or password, instead enter your Macaroon as the
\f[C]bearer_token\f[].
.PP
The config will end up looking something like this.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[dcache]
type\ =\ webdav
url\ =\ https://dcache...
vendor\ =\ other
user\ =
pass\ =
bearer_token\ =\ your\-macaroon
\f[]
.fi
.PP
There is a
script (https://github.com/sara-nl/GridScripts/blob/master/get-macaroon)
that obtains a Macaroon from a dCache WebDAV endpoint, and creates an
rclone config file.
.PP
Macaroons may also be obtained from the dCacheView
web\-browser/JavaScript client that comes with dCache.
.SS OpenID\-Connect
.PP
dCache also supports authenticating with OpenID\-Connect access tokens.
OpenID\-Connect is a protocol (based on OAuth 2.0) that allows services
to identify users who have authenticated with some central service.
.PP
Support for OpenID\-Connect in rclone is currently achieved using
another software package called
oidc\-agent (https://github.com/indigo-dc/oidc-agent).
This is a command\-line tool that facilitates obtaining an access token.
Once installed and configured, an access token is obtained by running
the \f[C]oidc\-token\f[] command.
The following example shows a (shortened) access token obtained from the
\f[I]XDC\f[] OIDC Provider.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
paul\@celebrimbor:~$\ oidc\-token\ XDC
eyJraWQ[...]QFXDt0
paul\@celebrimbor:~$
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[] Before the \f[C]oidc\-token\f[] command will work, the
refresh token must be loaded into the oidc agent.
This is done with the \f[C]oidc\-add\f[] command (e.g.,
\f[C]oidc\-add\ XDC\f[]).
This is typically done once per login session.
Full details on this and how to register oidc\-agent with your OIDC
Provider are provided in the oidc\-agent
documentation (https://indigo-dc.gitbooks.io/oidc-agent/).
.PP
The rclone \f[C]bearer_token_command\f[] configuration option is used to
fetch the access token from oidc\-agent.
.PP
Configure as a normal WebDAV endpoint, using the `other' vendor, leaving
the username and password empty.
When prompted, choose to edit the advanced config and enter the command
to get a bearer token (e.g., \f[C]oidc\-agent\ XDC\f[]).
.PP
The following example config shows a WebDAV endpoint that uses
oidc\-agent to supply an access token from the \f[I]XDC\f[] OIDC
Provider.

.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Yandex Disk.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[] like this,
.PP
See top level directories
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ lsd\ remote:
\f[]

excess files in the path.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ /home/local/directory\ remote:directory
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Yandex paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[].
.SS Modified time
.PP
Modified times are supported and are stored accurate to 1 ns in custom
metadata called \f[C]rclone_modified\f[] in RFC3339 with nanoseconds
format.
.SS MD5 checksums
.PP
MD5 checksums are natively supported by Yandex Disk.
.SS Emptying Trash
.PP
If you wish to empty your trash you can use the
\f[C]rclone\ cleanup\ remote:\f[] command which will permanently delete
all your trashed files.
This command does not take any path arguments.
.SS Quota information
.PP
To view your current quota you can use the
\f[C]rclone\ about\ remote:\f[] command which will display your usage
limit (quota) and the current usage.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
The default restricted characters set (/overview/#restricted-characters)
are replaced.
.PP
Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be replaced (/overview/#invalid-utf8), as
they can't be used in JSON strings.
.SS Limitations
.PP
When uploading very large files (bigger than about 5GB) you will need to
increase the \f[C]\-\-timeout\f[] parameter.
This is because Yandex pauses (perhaps to calculate the MD5SUM for the
entire file) before returning confirmation that the file has been
uploaded.
The default handling of timeouts in rclone is to assume a 5 minute pause
is an error and close the connection \- you'll see
\f[C]net/http:\ timeout\ awaiting\ response\ headers\f[] errors in the
logs if this is happening.
Setting the timeout to twice the max size of file in GB should be
enough, so if you want to upload a 30GB file set a timeout of
\f[C]2\ *\ 30\ =\ 60m\f[], that is \f[C]\-\-timeout\ 60m\f[].

.SS Local Filesystem
.PP
Local paths are specified as normal filesystem paths, eg
\f[C]/path/to/wherever\f[], so
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ /home/source\ /tmp/destination
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Will sync \f[C]/home/source\f[] to \f[C]/tmp/destination\f[]
.PP
These can be configured into the config file for consistencies sake, but
it is probably easier not to.
.SS Modified time
.PP
Rclone reads and writes the modified time using an accuracy determined
by the OS.
Typically this is 1ns on Linux, 10 ns on Windows and 1 Second on OS X.
.SS Filenames
.PP
Filenames should be encoded in UTF\-8 on disk.
This is the normal case for Windows and OS X.
.PP
There is a bit more uncertainty in the Linux world, but new
distributions will have UTF\-8 encoded files names.
If you are using an old Linux filesystem with non UTF\-8 file names (eg
latin1) then you can use the \f[C]convmv\f[] tool to convert the
filesystem to UTF\-8.
This tool is available in most distributions' package managers.
.PP
If an invalid (non\-UTF8) filename is read, the invalid characters will
be replaced with a quoted representation of the invalid bytes.
The name \f[C]gro\\xdf\f[] will be transferred as \f[C]gro‛DF\f[].
\f[C]rclone\f[] will emit a debug message in this case (use \f[C]\-v\f[]
to see), eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Local\ file\ system\ at\ .:\ Replacing\ invalid\ UTF\-8\ characters\ in\ "gro\\xdf"

.PP
Invalid UTF\-8 bytes will also be replaced (/overview/#invalid-utf8), as
they can't be converted to UTF\-16.
.SS Long paths on Windows
.PP
Rclone handles long paths automatically, by converting all paths to long
UNC
paths (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx#maxpath)
which allows paths up to 32,767 characters.
.PP
This is why you will see that your paths, for instance
\f[C]c:\\files\f[] is converted to the UNC path
\f[C]\\\\?\\c:\\files\f[] in the output, and \f[C]\\\\server\\share\f[]
is converted to \f[C]\\\\?\\UNC\\server\\share\f[].
.PP
However, in rare cases this may cause problems with buggy file system
drivers like EncFS (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/261).
To disable UNC conversion globally, add this to your
\f[C]\&.rclone.conf\f[] file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[local]
nounc\ =\ true
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you want to selectively disable UNC, you can add it to a separate
entry like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[nounc]
type\ =\ local
nounc\ =\ true
\f[]
.fi
.PP
And use rclone like this:
.PP
\f[C]rclone\ copy\ c:\\src\ nounc:z:\\dst\f[]
.PP
This will use UNC paths on \f[C]c:\\src\f[] but not on \f[C]z:\\dst\f[].
Of course this will cause problems if the absolute path length of a file
exceeds 258 characters on z, so only use this option if you have to.
.SS Symlinks / Junction points
.PP
Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).
.PP
If you supply \f[C]\-\-copy\-links\f[] or \f[C]\-L\f[] then rclone will
follow the symlink and copy the pointed to file or directory.
Note that this flag is incompatible with \f[C]\-links\f[] /
\f[C]\-l\f[].
.PP
This flag applies to all commands.
.PP
For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ tree\ /tmp/a
/tmp/a
├──\ b\ \->\ ../b
├──\ expected\ \->\ ../expected
├──\ one
└──\ two
\ \ \ \ └──\ three
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then you can see the difference with and without the flag like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ ls\ /tmp/a
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 6\ one
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 6\ two/three
\f[]
.fi
.PP
and
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ \-L\ ls\ /tmp/a
\ \ \ \ \ 4174\ expected
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 6\ one
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 6\ two/three
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 6\ b/two
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 6\ b/one
\f[]
.fi
.SS \[en]links, \-l
.PP
Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).
.PP
If you supply this flag then rclone will copy symbolic links from the
local storage, and store them as text files, with a `.rclonelink' suffix
in the remote storage.
.PP
The text file will contain the target of the symbolic link (see
example).
.PP
This flag applies to all commands.
.PP
For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ tree\ /tmp/a
/tmp/a
├──\ file1\ \->\ ./file4
└──\ file2\ \->\ /home/user/file3
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Copying the entire directory with `\-l'
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ copyto\ \-l\ /tmp/a/file1\ remote:/tmp/a/
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The remote files are created with a `.rclonelink' suffix
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ ls\ remote:/tmp/a
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ 5\ file1.rclonelink
\ \ \ \ \ \ 14\ file2.rclonelink
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The remote files will contain the target of the symbolic links
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ cat\ remote:/tmp/a/file1.rclonelink
\&./file4

$\ rclone\ cat\ remote:/tmp/a/file2.rclonelink
/home/user/file3
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Copying them back with `\-l'
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ copyto\ \-l\ remote:/tmp/a/\ /tmp/b/

$\ tree\ /tmp/b
/tmp/b
├──\ file1\ \->\ ./file4
└──\ file2\ \->\ /home/user/file3
\f[]
.fi
.PP
However, if copied back without `\-l'
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ copyto\ remote:/tmp/a/\ /tmp/b/

$\ tree\ /tmp/b
/tmp/b
├──\ file1.rclonelink
└──\ file2.rclonelink
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that this flag is incompatible with \f[C]\-copy\-links\f[] /
\f[C]\-L\f[].
.SS Restricting filesystems with \[en]one\-file\-system
.PP
Normally rclone will recurse through filesystems as mounted.
.PP
However if you set \f[C]\-\-one\-file\-system\f[] or \f[C]\-x\f[] this
tells rclone to stay in the filesystem specified by the root and not to
recurse into different file systems.
.PP
For example if you have a directory hierarchy like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
root
├──\ disk1\ \ \ \ \ \-\ disk1\ mounted\ on\ the\ root
│\ \ \ └──\ file3\ \-\ stored\ on\ disk1
├──\ disk2\ \ \ \ \ \-\ disk2\ mounted\ on\ the\ root
│\ \ \ └──\ file4\ \-\ stored\ on\ disk12
├──\ file1\ \ \ \ \ \-\ stored\ on\ the\ root\ disk
└──\ file2\ \ \ \ \ \-\ stored\ on\ the\ root\ disk
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Using \f[C]rclone\ \-\-one\-file\-system\ copy\ root\ remote:\f[] will
only copy \f[C]file1\f[] and \f[C]file2\f[].
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ \-q\ \-\-one\-file\-system\ ls\ root
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\ file1
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\ file2
\f[]
.fi
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ \-q\ ls\ root
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\ disk1/file3
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\ disk2/file4
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\ file1
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0\ file2
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[] Rclone (like most unix tools such as \f[C]du\f[],
\f[C]rsync\f[] and \f[C]tar\f[]) treats a bind mount to the same device
as being on the same filesystem.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[] This flag is only available on Unix based systems.
On systems where it isn't supported (eg Windows) it will be ignored.

upload.
.PP

Glusterfs #2206 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2206)) so this
check can be disabled with this flag.

.SH Bugs and Limitations
.SS Limitations
.SS Directory timestamps aren't preserved
.PP
Rclone doesn't currently preserve the timestamps of directories.
This is because rclone only really considers objects when syncing.
.SS Rclone struggles with millions of files in a directory
.PP
Currently rclone loads each directory entirely into memory before using
it.
Since each Rclone object takes 0.5k\-1k of memory this can take a very
long time and use an extremely large amount of memory.
.PP
Millions of files in a directory tend caused by software writing cloud
storage (eg S3 buckets).
.SS Bucket based remotes and folders
.PP
Bucket based remotes (eg S3/GCS/Swift/B2) do not have a concept of
directories.
Rclone therefore cannot create directories in them which means that
empty directories on a bucket based remote will tend to disappear.
.PP
Some software creates empty keys ending in \f[C]/\f[] as directory
markers.
Rclone doesn't do this as it potentially creates more objects and costs
more.
It may do in future (probably with a flag).

.SS Frequently Asked Questions
.SS Do all cloud storage systems support all rclone commands
.PP
Yes they do.
All the rclone commands (eg \f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[] etc) will work
on all the remote storage systems.
.SS Can I copy the config from one machine to another
.PP
Sure! Rclone stores all of its config in a single file.
If you want to find this file, run \f[C]rclone\ config\ file\f[] which
will tell you where it is.
.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for more
info.
.SS How do I configure rclone on a remote / headless box with no
browser?
.PP
This has now been documented in its own remote setup
page (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/).
.SS Can rclone sync directly from drive to s3
.PP
Rclone can sync between two remote cloud storage systems just fine.
.PP
Note that it effectively downloads the file and uploads it again, so the
node running rclone would need to have lots of bandwidth.
.PP
The syncs would be incremental (on a file by file basis).
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ drive:Folder\ s3:bucket
\f[]
.fi
.SS Using rclone from multiple locations at the same time
.PP
You can use rclone from multiple places at the same time if you choose
different subdirectory for the output, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Server\ A>\ rclone\ sync\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:ServerA
Server\ B>\ rclone\ sync\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:ServerB
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you sync to the same directory then you should use rclone copy
otherwise the two rclones may delete each others files, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Server\ A>\ rclone\ copy\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:Backup
Server\ B>\ rclone\ copy\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:Backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The file names you upload from Server A and Server B should be different
in this case, otherwise some file systems (eg Drive) may make
duplicates.
.SS Why doesn't rclone support partial transfers / binary diffs like
rsync?
.PP
Rclone stores each file you transfer as a native object on the remote
cloud storage system.
This means that you can see the files you upload as expected using
alternative access methods (eg using the Google Drive web interface).
There is a 1:1 mapping between files on your hard disk and objects
created in the cloud storage system.
.PP
Cloud storage systems (at least none I've come across yet) don't support
partially uploading an object.
You can't take an existing object, and change some bytes in the middle
of it.
.PP
It would be possible to make a sync system which stored binary diffs
instead of whole objects like rclone does, but that would break the 1:1
mapping of files on your hard disk to objects in the remote cloud
storage system.
.PP
All the cloud storage systems support partial downloads of content, so
it would be possible to make partial downloads work.
However to make this work efficiently this would require storing a
significant amount of metadata, which breaks the desired 1:1 mapping of
files to objects.
.SS Can rclone do bi\-directional sync?
.PP
No, not at present.
rclone only does uni\-directional sync from A \-> B.
It may do in the future though since it has all the primitives \- it
just requires writing the algorithm to do it.
.SS Can I use rclone with an HTTP proxy?
.PP
Yes.
rclone will follow the standard environment variables for proxies,
similar to cURL and other programs.
.PP
In general the variables are called \f[C]http_proxy\f[] (for services
reached over \f[C]http\f[]) and \f[C]https_proxy\f[] (for services
reached over \f[C]https\f[]).
Most public services will be using \f[C]https\f[], but you may wish to
set both.
.PP
The content of the variable is \f[C]protocol://server:port\f[].
The protocol value is the one used to talk to the proxy server, itself,
and is commonly either \f[C]http\f[] or \f[C]socks5\f[].
.PP
Slightly annoyingly, there is no \f[I]standard\f[] for the name; some
applications may use \f[C]http_proxy\f[] but another one
\f[C]HTTP_PROXY\f[].
The \f[C]Go\f[] libraries used by \f[C]rclone\f[] will try both
variations, but you may wish to set all possibilities.
So, on Linux, you may end up with code similar to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export\ http_proxy=http://proxyserver:12345
export\ https_proxy=$http_proxy
export\ HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy
export\ HTTPS_PROXY=$http_proxy
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The \f[C]NO_PROXY\f[] allows you to disable the proxy for specific
hosts.
Hosts must be comma separated, and can contain domains or parts.
For instance \[lq]foo.com\[rq] also matches \[lq]bar.foo.com\[rq].
.PP
e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export\ no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.0/8,my.host.name
export\ NO_PROXY=$no_proxy
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that the ftp backend does not support \f[C]ftp_proxy\f[] yet.
.SS Rclone gives x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided
error
.PP
This means that \f[C]rclone\f[] can't file the SSL root certificates.
Likely you are running \f[C]rclone\f[] on a NAS with a cut\-down Linux
OS, or possibly on Solaris.
.PP
Rclone (via the Go runtime) tries to load the root certificates from
these places on Linux.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
"/etc/ssl/certs/ca\-certificates.crt",\ //\ Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo\ etc.
"/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca\-bundle.crt",\ \ \ //\ Fedora/RHEL
"/etc/ssl/ca\-bundle.pem",\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ //\ OpenSUSE
"/etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem",\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ //\ OpenELEC
\f[]
.fi
.PP
So doing something like this should fix the problem.
It also sets the time which is important for SSL to work properly.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
mkdir\ \-p\ /etc/ssl/certs/
curl\ \-o\ /etc/ssl/certs/ca\-certificates.crt\ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca\-bundle/master/ca\-bundle.crt
ntpclient\ \-s\ \-h\ pool.ntp.org
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The two environment variables \f[C]SSL_CERT_FILE\f[] and
\f[C]SSL_CERT_DIR\f[], mentioned in the x509
package (https://godoc.org/crypto/x509), provide an additional way to
provide the SSL root certificates.
.PP
Note that you may need to add the \f[C]\-\-insecure\f[] option to the
\f[C]curl\f[] command line if it doesn't work without.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
curl\ \-\-insecure\ \-o\ /etc/ssl/certs/ca\-certificates.crt\ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca\-bundle/master/ca\-bundle.crt
\f[]
.fi
.SS Rclone gives Failed to load config file: function not implemented
error
.PP
Likely this means that you are running rclone on Linux version not
supported by the go runtime, ie earlier than version 2.6.23.
.PP
See the system requirements section in the go install
docs (https://golang.org/doc/install) for full details.
.SS All my uploaded docx/xlsx/pptx files appear as archive/zip
.PP
This is caused by uploading these files from a Windows computer which
hasn't got the Microsoft Office suite installed.
The easiest way to fix is to install the Word viewer and the Microsoft
Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 and later
versions' file formats
.SS tcp lookup some.domain.com no such host
.PP
This happens when rclone cannot resolve a domain.
Please check that your DNS setup is generally working, e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ both\ should\ print\ a\ long\ list\ of\ possible\ IP\ addresses
dig\ www.googleapis.com\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ #\ resolve\ using\ your\ default\ DNS
dig\ www.googleapis.com\ \@8.8.8.8\ #\ resolve\ with\ Google\[aq]s\ DNS\ server
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you are using \f[C]systemd\-resolved\f[] (default on Arch Linux),
ensure it is at version 233 or higher.
Previous releases contain a bug which causes not all domains to be
resolved properly.
.PP
Additionally with the \f[C]GODEBUG=netdns=\f[] environment variable the
Go resolver decision can be influenced.
This also allows to resolve certain issues with DNS resolution.
See the name resolution section in the go
docs (https://golang.org/pkg/net/#hdr-Name_Resolution).
.SS The total size reported in the stats for a sync is wrong and keeps
changing
.PP
It is likely you have more than 10,000 files that need to be synced.
By default rclone only gets 10,000 files ahead in a sync so as not to
use up too much memory.
You can change this default with the
\[en]max\-backlog (/docs/#max-backlog-n) flag.
.SS Rclone is using too much memory or appears to have a memory leak
.PP
Rclone is written in Go which uses a garbage collector.
The default settings for the garbage collector mean that it runs when
the heap size has doubled.
.PP
However it is possible to tune the garbage collector to use less memory
by setting GOGC (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/gogc) to a lower value, say
\f[C]export\ GOGC=20\f[].
This will make the garbage collector work harder, reducing memory size
at the expense of CPU usage.
.PP
The most common cause of rclone using lots of memory is a single
directory with thousands or millions of files in.
Rclone has to load this entirely into memory as rclone objects.
Each rclone object takes 0.5k\-1k of memory.
