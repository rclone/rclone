<h2 id="about">About rclone</h2>
<p>Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. It is a feature-rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage interfaces. <a href="#providers">Over 70 cloud storage products</a> support rclone including S3 object stores, business &amp; consumer file storage services, as well as standard transfer protocols.</p>
<p>Rclone has powerful cloud equivalents to the unix commands rsync, cp, mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat. Rclone's familiar syntax includes shell pipeline support, and <code>--dry-run</code> protection. It is used at the command line, in scripts or via its <a href="/rc">API</a>.</p>
<p>Users call rclone <em>"The Swiss army knife of cloud storage"</em>, and <em>"Technology indistinguishable from magic"</em>.</p>
<p>Rclone really looks after your data. It preserves timestamps and verifies checksums at all times. Transfers over limited bandwidth; intermittent connections, or subject to quota can be restarted, from the last good file transferred. You can <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/">check</a> the integrity of your files. Where possible, rclone employs server-side transfers to minimise local bandwidth use and transfers from one provider to another without using local disk.</p>
<p>Virtual backends wrap local and cloud file systems to apply <a href="https://rclone.org/crypt/">encryption</a>, <a href="https://rclone.org/compress/">compression</a>, <a href="https://rclone.org/chunker/">chunking</a>, <a href="https://rclone.org/hasher/">hashing</a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/union/">joining</a>.</p>
<p>Rclone <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/">mounts</a> any local, cloud or virtual filesystem as a disk on Windows, macOS, linux and FreeBSD, and also serves these over <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_sftp/">SFTP</a>, <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_http/">HTTP</a>, <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_webdav/">WebDAV</a>, <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_ftp/">FTP</a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_dlna/">DLNA</a>.</p>
<p>Rclone is mature, open-source software originally inspired by rsync and written in <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>. The friendly support community is familiar with varied use cases. Official Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Brew and Chocolatey repos. include rclone. For the latest version <a href="https://rclone.org/downloads/">downloading from rclone.org</a> is recommended.</p>
<p>Rclone is widely used on Linux, Windows and Mac. Third-party developers create innovative backup, restore, GUI and business process solutions using the rclone command line or API.</p>
<p>Rclone does the heavy lifting of communicating with cloud storage.</p>

<p>NOTE: This version of rclone will not support <code>mount</code> any more (see <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5373">#5373</a>). If mounting is wanted on macOS, either install a precompiled binary or enable the relevant option when <a href="#source">installing from source</a>.</p>
<p>Note that this is a third party installer not controlled by the rclone developers so it may be out of date. Its current version is as below.</p>
<p><a href="https://repology.org/project/rclone/versions"><img src="https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/homebrew/rclone.svg" alt="Homebrew package" /></a></p>
<h3 id="macos-macports">Installation with MacPorts</h3>
<p>On macOS, rclone can also be installed via <a href="https://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>:</p>
<pre><code>sudo port install rclone</code></pre>
<p>Note that this is a third party installer not controlled by the rclone developers so it may be out of date. Its current version is as below.</p>
<p><a href="https://repology.org/project/rclone/versions"><img src="https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/macports/rclone.svg" alt="MacPorts port" /></a></p>
<p>More information <a href="https://ports.macports.org/port/rclone/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="macos-precompiled">Precompiled binary, using curl</h3>
<p>To avoid problems with macOS gatekeeper enforcing the binary to be signed and notarized it is enough to download with <code>curl</code>.</p>
<p>Download the latest version of rclone.</p>
<pre><code>cd &amp;&amp; curl -O https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-osx-amd64.zip</code></pre>

<pre><code>unzip -a rclone-current-osx-amd64.zip &amp;&amp; cd rclone-*-osx-amd64</code></pre>
<p>Move rclone to your $PATH. You will be prompted for your password.</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo mv rclone /usr/local/bin/</code></pre>
<p>(the <code>mkdir</code> command is safe to run, even if the directory already exists).</p>
<p>Remove the leftover files.</p>
<pre><code>cd .. &amp;&amp; rm -rf rclone-*-osx-amd64 rclone-current-osx-amd64.zip</code></pre>
<p>Run <code>rclone config</code> to setup. See <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/">rclone config docs</a> for more details.</p>
<pre><code>rclone config</code></pre>
<h3 id="macos-precompiled-web">Precompiled binary, using a web browser</h3>
<p>When downloading a binary with a web browser, the browser will set the macOS gatekeeper quarantine attribute. Starting from Catalina, when attempting to run <code>rclone</code>, a pop-up will appear saying:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;rclone&quot; cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.</code></pre>
<p>The simplest fix is to run</p>
<pre><code>xattr -d com.apple.quarantine rclone</code></pre>
<h2 id="windows">Windows installation</h2>
<h3 id="windows-precompiled">Precompiled binary</h3>
<p>Fetch the correct binary for your processor type by clicking on these links. If not sure, use the first link.</p>

<p>If you are planning to use the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/">rclone mount</a> feature then you will need to install the third party utility <a href="https://winfsp.dev/">WinFsp</a> also.</p>
<h3 id="windows-chocolatey">Windows package manager (Winget)</h3>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/">Winget</a> comes pre-installed with the latest versions of Windows. If not, update the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/p/app-installer/9nblggh4nns1">App Installer</a> package from the Microsoft store.</p>
<p>To install rclone</p>
<pre><code>winget install Rclone.Rclone</code></pre>
<p>To uninstall rclone</p>
<pre><code>winget uninstall Rclone.Rclone --force</code></pre>
<h3 id="windows-chocolatey">Chocolatey package manager</h3>
<p>Make sure you have <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Choco</a> installed</p>
<pre><code>choco search rclone
choco install rclone</code></pre>
<p>This will install rclone on your Windows machine. If you are planning to use <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/">rclone mount</a> then</p>
<pre><code>choco install winfsp</code></pre>
<p>will install that too.</p>
<p>Note that this is a third party installer not controlled by the rclone developers so it may be out of date. Its current version is as below.</p>

<h2 id="package-manager">Package manager installation</h2>
<p>Many Linux, Windows, macOS and other OS distributions package and distribute rclone.</p>
<p>The distributed versions of rclone are often quite out of date and for this reason we recommend one of the other installation methods if possible.</p>
<p>You can get an idea of how up to date or not your OS distribution's package is here.</p>

<h2 id="docker">Docker installation</h2>
<p>The rclone developers maintain a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/rclone/rclone">docker image for rclone</a>.</p>
<p>These images are built as part of the release process based on a minimal Alpine Linux.</p>
<p>The <code>:latest</code> tag will always point to the latest stable release. You can use the <code>:beta</code> tag to get the latest build from master. You can also use version tags, e.g. <code>:1.49.1</code>, <code>:1.49</code> or <code>:1</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull rclone/rclone:latest
latest: Pulling from rclone/rclone
Digest: sha256:0e0ced72671989bb837fea8e88578b3fc48371aa45d209663683e24cfdaa0e11
...
$ docker run --rm rclone/rclone:latest version
rclone v1.49.1
- os/arch: linux/amd64
- go version: go1.12.9</code></pre>
<p>There are a few command line options to consider when starting an rclone Docker container from the rclone image.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You need to mount the host rclone config dir at <code>/config/rclone</code> into the Docker container. Due to the fact that rclone updates tokens inside its config file, and that the update process involves a file rename, you need to mount the whole host rclone config dir, not just the single host rclone config file.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to mount a host data dir at <code>/data</code> into the Docker container.</p></li>
<li><p>By default, the rclone binary inside a Docker container runs with UID=0 (root). As a result, all files created in a run will have UID=0. If your config and data files reside on the host with a non-root UID:GID, you need to pass these on the container start command line.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to access the RC interface (either via the API or the Web UI), it is required to set the <code>--rc-addr</code> to <code>:5572</code> in order to connect to it from outside the container. An explanation about why this is necessary is present <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808071950/https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-connection-refused/">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>NOTE: Users running this container with the docker network set to <code>host</code> should probably set it to listen to localhost only, with <code>127.0.0.1:5572</code> as the value for <code>--rc-addr</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>It is possible to use <code>rclone mount</code> inside a userspace Docker container, and expose the resulting fuse mount to the host. The exact <code>docker run</code> options to do that might vary slightly between hosts. See, e.g. the discussion in this <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/9448">thread</a>.</p>
<p>You also need to mount the host <code>/etc/passwd</code> and <code>/etc/group</code> for fuse to work inside the container.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some commands tested on an Ubuntu 18.04.3 host:</p>
<pre><code># config on host at ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
# data on host at ~/data

# add a remote interactively
docker run --rm -it \
    --volume ~/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \
    --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    rclone/rclone \
    config

# make sure the config is ok by listing the remotes
docker run --rm \
    --volume ~/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \
    --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    rclone/rclone \
    listremotes

# perform mount inside Docker container, expose result to host
mkdir -p ~/data/mount
docker run --rm \
    --volume ~/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \
    --volume ~/data:/data:shared \
    --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    --volume /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro --volume /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \
    --device /dev/fuse --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --security-opt apparmor:unconfined \
    rclone/rclone \
    mount dropbox:Photos /data/mount &amp;
ls ~/data/mount

<h2 id="snap">Snap installation</h2>
<p><a href="https://snapcraft.io/rclone"><img src="https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg" alt="Get it from the Snap Store" /></a></p>
<p>Make sure you have <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd">Snapd installed</a></p>

<p>Due to the strict confinement of Snap, rclone snap cannot access real /home/$USER/.config/rclone directory, default config path is as below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Default config directory:
<ul>
<li>/home/$USER/snap/rclone/current/.config/rclone</li>

</ul>
<p>Note: Due to the strict confinement of Snap, <code>rclone mount</code> feature is <code>not</code> supported.</p>
<p>If mounting is wanted, either install a precompiled binary or enable the relevant option when <a href="#source">installing from source</a>.</p>
<p>Note that this is controlled by <a href="https://github.com/boukendesho/rclone-snap">community maintainer</a> not the rclone developers so it may be out of date. Its current version is as below.</p>
<p><a href="https://snapcraft.io/rclone"><img src="https://snapcraft.io/rclone/badge.svg" alt="rclone" /></a></p>
<h2 id="source">Source installation</h2>
<p>Make sure you have git and <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> installed. Go version 1.22 or newer is required, the latest release is recommended. You can get it from your package manager, or download it from <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">golang.org/dl</a>. Then you can run the following:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/rclone/rclone.git
cd rclone
go build</code></pre>
<p>This will check out the rclone source in subfolder rclone, which you can later modify and send pull requests with. Then it will build the rclone executable in the same folder. As an initial check you can now run <code>./rclone version</code> (<code>.\rclone version</code> on Windows).</p>
<p>Note that on macOS and Windows the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/">mount</a> command will not be available unless you specify an additional build tag <code>cmount</code>.</p>
<pre><code>go build -tags cmount</code></pre>
<p>This assumes you have a GCC compatible C compiler (GCC or Clang) in your PATH, as it uses <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo">cgo</a>. But on Windows, the <a href="https://github.com/winfsp/cgofuse">cgofuse</a> library that the cmount implementation is based on, also supports building <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WindowsDLLs">without cgo</a>, i.e. by setting environment variable CGO_ENABLED to value 0 (static linking). This is how the official Windows release of rclone is being built, starting with version 1.59. It is still possible to build with cgo on Windows as well, by using the MinGW port of GCC, e.g. by installing it in a <a href="https://www.msys2.org">MSYS2</a> distribution (make sure you install it in the classic mingw64 subsystem, the ucrt64 version is not compatible).</p>
<p>Additionally, to build with mount on Windows, you must install the third party utility <a href="https://winfsp.dev/">WinFsp</a>, with the "Developer" feature selected. If building with cgo, you must also set environment variable CPATH pointing to the fuse include directory within the WinFsp installation (normally <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\WinFsp\inc\fuse</code>).</p>
<p>You may add arguments <code>-ldflags -s</code> to omit symbol table and debug information, making the executable file smaller, and <code>-trimpath</code> to remove references to local file system paths. The official rclone releases are built with both of these.</p>
<pre><code>go build -trimpath -ldflags -s -tags cmount</code></pre>
<p>If you want to customize the version string, as reported by the <code>rclone version</code> command, you can set one of the variables <code>fs.Version</code>, <code>fs.VersionTag</code> (to keep default suffix but customize the number), or <code>fs.VersionSuffix</code> (to keep default number but customize the suffix). This can be done from the build command, by adding to the <code>-ldflags</code> argument value as shown below.</p>
<pre><code>go build -trimpath -ldflags &quot;-s -X github.com/rclone/rclone/fs.Version=v9.9.9-test&quot; -tags cmount</code></pre>
<p>On Windows, the official executables also have the version information, as well as a file icon, embedded as binary resources. To get that with your own build you need to run the following command <strong>before</strong> the build command. It generates a Windows resource system object file, with extension .syso, e.g. <code>resource_windows_amd64.syso</code>, that will be automatically picked up by future build commands.</p>
<pre><code>go run bin/resource_windows.go</code></pre>
<p>The above command will generate a resource file containing version information based on the fs.Version variable in source at the time you run the command, which means if the value of this variable changes you need to re-run the command for it to be reflected in the version information. Also, if you override this version variable in the build command as described above, you need to do that also when generating the resource file, or else it will still use the value from the source.</p>
<pre><code>go run bin/resource_windows.go -version v9.9.9-test</code></pre>
<p>Instead of executing the <code>go build</code> command directly, you can run it via the Makefile. The default target changes the version suffix from "-DEV" to "-beta" followed by additional commit details, embeds version information binary resources on Windows, and copies the resulting rclone executable into your GOPATH bin folder (<code>$(go env GOPATH)/bin</code>, which corresponds to <code>~/go/bin/rclone</code> by default).</p>
<pre><code>make</code></pre>
<p>To include mount command on macOS and Windows with Makefile build:</p>
<pre><code>make GOTAGS=cmount</code></pre>
<p>There are other make targets that can be used for more advanced builds, such as cross-compiling for all supported os/architectures, and packaging results into release artifacts. See <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/Makefile">Makefile</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/bin/cross-compile.go">cross-compile.go</a> for details.</p>
<p>Another alternative method for source installation is to download the source, build and install rclone - all in one operation, as a regular Go package. The source will be stored it in the Go module cache, and the resulting executable will be in your GOPATH bin folder (<code>$(go env GOPATH)/bin</code>, which corresponds to <code>~/go/bin/rclone</code> by default).</p>
<pre><code>go install github.com/rclone/rclone@latest</code></pre>
<p>In some situations, rclone executable size might be too big for deployment in very restricted environments when all backends with large SDKs are included. To limit binary size unused backends can be commented out in <code>backends/all/all.go</code> and unused commands in <code>cmd/all/all.go</code> before building with <code>go build</code> or <code>make</code></p>
<h2 id="ansible">Ansible installation</h2>
<p>This can be done with <a href="https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone">Stefan Weichinger's ansible role</a>.</p>
<p>Instructions</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone.git</code> into your local roles-directory</li>
<li>add the role to the hosts you want rclone installed to:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>    - hosts: rclone-hosts
      roles:
          - rclone</code></pre>
<h2 id="portable">Portable installation</h2>
<p>As mentioned <a href="https://rclone.org/install/#quickstart">above</a>, rclone is single executable (<code>rclone</code>, or <code>rclone.exe</code> on Windows) that you can download as a zip archive and extract into a location of your choosing. When executing different commands, it may create files in different locations, such as a configuration file and various temporary files. By default the locations for these are according to your operating system, e.g. configuration file in your user profile directory and temporary files in the standard temporary directory, but you can customize all of them, e.g. to make a completely self-contained, portable installation.</p>
<p>Run the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_paths/">config paths</a> command to see the locations that rclone will use.</p>
<p>To override them set the corresponding options (as command-line arguments, or as <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#environment-variables">environment variables</a>): - <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#config-config-file">--config</a> - <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#cache-dir-dir">--cache-dir</a> - <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#temp-dir-dir">--temp-dir</a></p>
<h2 id="autostart">Autostart</h2>
<p>After installing and configuring rclone, as described above, you are ready to use rclone as an interactive command line utility. If your goal is to perform <em>periodic</em> operations, such as a regular <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/">sync</a>, you will probably want to configure your rclone command in your operating system's scheduler. If you need to expose <em>service</em>-like features, such as <a href="https://rclone.org/rc/">remote control</a>, <a href="https://rclone.org/gui/">GUI</a>, <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/">serve</a> or <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/">mount</a>, you will often want an rclone command always running in the background, and configuring it to run in a service infrastructure may be a better option. Below are some alternatives on how to achieve this on different operating systems.</p>
<p>NOTE: Before setting up autorun it is highly recommended that you have tested your command manually from a Command Prompt first.</p>
<h3 id="autostart-on-windows">Autostart on Windows</h3>
<p>The most relevant alternatives for autostart on Windows are: - Run at user log on using the Startup folder - Run at user log on, at system startup or at schedule using Task Scheduler - Run at system startup using Windows service</p>
<h4 id="running-in-background">Running in background</h4>
<p>Rclone is a console application, so if not starting from an existing Command Prompt, e.g. when starting rclone.exe from a shortcut, it will open a Command Prompt window. When configuring rclone to run from task scheduler and windows service you are able to set it to run hidden in background. From rclone version 1.54 you can also make it run hidden from anywhere by adding option <code>--no-console</code> (it may still flash briefly when the program starts). Since rclone normally writes information and any error messages to the console, you must redirect this to a file to be able to see it. Rclone has a built-in option <code>--log-file</code> for that.</p>
<p>Example command to run a sync in background:</p>
<pre><code>c:\rclone\rclone.exe sync c:\files remote:/files --no-console --log-file c:\rclone\logs\sync_files.txt</code></pre>
<h4 id="user-account">User account</h4>
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/">mount</a> documentation, mounted drives created as Administrator are not visible to other accounts, not even the account that was elevated as Administrator. By running the mount command as the built-in <code>SYSTEM</code> user account, it will create drives accessible for everyone on the system. Both scheduled task and Windows service can be used to achieve this.</p>
<p>NOTE: Remember that when rclone runs as the <code>SYSTEM</code> user, the user profile that it sees will not be yours. This means that if you normally run rclone with configuration file in the default location, to be able to use the same configuration when running as the system user you must explicitly tell rclone where to find it with the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#config-config-file"><code>--config</code></a> option, or else it will look in the system users profile path (<code>C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile</code>). To test your command manually from a Command Prompt, you can run it with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec">PsExec</a> utility from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite, which takes option <code>-s</code> to execute commands as the <code>SYSTEM</code> user.</p>
<h4 id="start-from-startup-folder">Start from Startup folder</h4>
<p>To quickly execute an rclone command you can simply create a standard Windows Explorer shortcut for the complete rclone command you want to run. If you store this shortcut in the special "Startup" start-menu folder, Windows will automatically run it at login. To open this folder in Windows Explorer, enter path <code>%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</code>, or <code>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp</code> if you want the command to start for <em>every</em> user that logs in.</p>
<p>This is the easiest approach to autostarting of rclone, but it offers no functionality to set it to run as different user, or to set conditions or actions on certain events. Setting up a scheduled task as described below will often give you better results.</p>
<h4 id="start-from-task-scheduler">Start from Task Scheduler</h4>
<p>Task Scheduler is an administrative tool built into Windows, and it can be used to configure rclone to be started automatically in a highly configurable way, e.g. periodically on a schedule, on user log on, or at system startup. It can run be configured to run as the current user, or for a mount command that needs to be available to all users it can run as the <code>SYSTEM</code> user. For technical information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/taskschd/task-scheduler-start-page.</p>
<h4 id="run-as-service">Run as service</h4>
<p>For running rclone at system startup, you can create a Windows service that executes your rclone command, as an alternative to scheduled task configured to run at startup.</p>
<h5 id="mount-command-built-in-service-integration">Mount command built-in service integration</h5>
<p>For mount commands, rclone has a built-in Windows service integration via the third-party WinFsp library it uses. Registering as a regular Windows service easy, as you just have to execute the built-in PowerShell command <code>New-Service</code> (requires administrative privileges).</p>
<p>Example of a PowerShell command that creates a Windows service for mounting some <code>remote:/files</code> as drive letter <code>X:</code>, for <em>all</em> users (service will be running as the local system account):</p>
<pre><code>New-Service -Name Rclone -BinaryPathName &#39;c:\rclone\rclone.exe mount remote:/files X: --config c:\rclone\config\rclone.conf --log-file c:\rclone\logs\mount.txt&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp/wiki/WinFsp-Service-Architecture">WinFsp service infrastructure</a> supports incorporating services for file system implementations, such as rclone, into its own launcher service, as kind of "child services". This has the additional advantage that it also implements a network provider that integrates into Windows standard methods for managing network drives. This is currently not officially supported by Rclone, but with WinFsp version 2019.3 B2 / v1.5B2 or later it should be possible through path rewriting as described <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3340">here</a>.</p>
<h5 id="third-party-service-integration">Third-party service integration</h5>
<p>To Windows service running any rclone command, the excellent third-party utility <a href="http://nssm.cc">NSSM</a>, the "Non-Sucking Service Manager", can be used. It includes some advanced features such as adjusting process priority, defining process environment variables, redirect to file anything written to stdout, and customized response to different exit codes, with a GUI to configure everything from (although it can also be used from command line ).</p>
<p>There are also several other alternatives. To mention one more, <a href="https://github.com/winsw/winsw">WinSW</a>, "Windows Service Wrapper", is worth checking out. It requires .NET Framework, but it is preinstalled on newer versions of Windows, and it also provides alternative standalone distributions which includes necessary runtime (.NET 5). WinSW is a command-line only utility, where you have to manually create an XML file with service configuration. This may be a drawback for some, but it can also be an advantage as it is easy to back up and reuse the configuration settings, without having go through manual steps in a GUI. One thing to note is that by default it does not restart the service on error, one have to explicit enable this in the configuration file (via the "onfailure" parameter).</p>
<h3 id="autostart-on-linux">Autostart on Linux</h3>
<h4 id="start-as-a-service">Start as a service</h4>
<p>To always run rclone in background, relevant for mount commands etc, you can use systemd to set up rclone as a system or user service. Running as a system service ensures that it is run at startup even if the user it is running as has no active session. Running rclone as a user service ensures that it only starts after the configured user has logged into the system.</p>
<h4 id="run-periodically-from-cron">Run periodically from cron</h4>
<p>To run a periodic command, such as a copy/sync, you can set up a cron job.</p>
<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
<p>Rclone is a command line program to manage files on cloud storage. After <a href="https://rclone.org/downloads/">download</a> and <a href="/install">install</a>, continue here to learn how to use it: Initial <a href="#configure">configuration</a>, what the <a href="#basic-syntax">basic syntax</a> looks like, describes the various <a href="#subcommands">subcommands</a>, the various <a href="#options">options</a>, and more.</p>
<h2 id="configure">Configure</h2>
<p>First, you'll need to configure rclone. As the object storage systems have quite complicated authentication these are kept in a config file. (See the <a href="#config-config-file"><code>--config</code></a> entry for how to find the config file and choose its location.)</p>
<p>The easiest way to make the config is to run rclone with the config option:</p>

<h2 id="basic-syntax">Basic syntax</h2>
<p>Rclone syncs a directory tree from one storage system to another.</p>
<p>Its syntax is like this</p>
<pre><code>rclone subcommand [options] &lt;parameters&gt; &lt;parameters...&gt;</code></pre>
<p>A <code>subcommand</code> is a the rclone operation required, (e.g. <code>sync</code>, <code>copy</code>, <code>ls</code>).</p>
<p>An <code>option</code> is a single letter flag (e.g. <code>-v</code>) or a group of single letter flags (e.g. <code>-Pv</code>) or a long flag (e.g. <code>--progress</code>). No options are required. Options can come after the <code>subcommand</code> or in between parameters too or on the end, but only global options can be used before the <code>subcommand</code>. Anything after a <code>--</code> option will not be interpreted as an option so if you need to add a parameter which starts with a <code>-</code> then put a <code>--</code> on its own first, eg</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf -- -directory-starting-with-dash</code></pre>
<p>A <code>parameter</code> is usually a file path or <a href="#syntax-of-remote-paths">rclone remote</a>, eg <code>/path/to/file</code> or <code>remote:path/to/file</code> but it can be other things - the <code>subcommand</code> help will tell you what.</p>
<p>Source and destination paths are specified by the name you gave the storage system in the config file then the sub path, e.g. "drive:myfolder" to look at "myfolder" in Google drive.</p>
<p>You can define as many storage paths as you like in the config file.</p>
<p>Please use the <a href="#interactive"><code>--interactive</code>/<code>-i</code></a> flag while learning rclone to avoid accidental data loss.</p>
<h2 id="subcommands">Subcommands</h2>
<p>rclone uses a system of subcommands. For example</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:path # lists a remote
rclone copy /local/path remote:path # copies /local/path to the remote
rclone sync --interactive /local/path remote:path # syncs /local/path to the remote</code></pre>
<h1 id="rclone-config">rclone config</h1>
<p>Enter an interactive configuration session.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-1">Synopsis</h2>

<h1 id="rclone-copy">rclone copy</h1>
<p>Copy files from source to dest, skipping identical files.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-2">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Copy the source to the destination. Does not transfer files that are identical on source and destination, testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM. Doesn't delete files from the destination. If you want to also delete files from destination, to make it match source, use the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/">sync</a> command instead.</p>
<p>Note that it is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not the directory itself. So when source:path is a directory, it's the contents of source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.</p>
<p>To copy single files, use the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copyto/">copyto</a> command instead.</p>
<p>If dest:path doesn't exist, it is created and the source:path contents go there.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy source:sourcepath dest:destpath</code></pre>
<p>Let's say there are two files in sourcepath</p>
<pre><code>sourcepath/one.txt
sourcepath/two.txt</code></pre>
<p>This copies them to</p>
<pre><code>destpath/one.txt
destpath/two.txt</code></pre>
<p>Not to</p>
<pre><code>destpath/sourcepath/one.txt
destpath/sourcepath/two.txt</code></pre>
<p>If you are familiar with <code>rsync</code>, rclone always works as if you had written a trailing <code>/</code> - meaning "copy the contents of this directory". This applies to all commands and whether you are talking about the source or destination.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#no-traverse">--no-traverse</a> option for controlling whether rclone lists the destination directory or not. Supplying this option when copying a small number of files into a large destination can speed transfers up greatly.</p>
<p>For example, if you have many files in /path/to/src but only a few of them change every day, you can copy all the files which have changed recently very efficiently like this:</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy --max-age 24h --no-traverse /path/to/src remote:</code></pre>
<p>Rclone will sync the modification times of files and directories if the backend supports it. If metadata syncing is required then use the <code>--metadata</code> flag.</p>
<p>Note that the modification time and metadata for the root directory will <strong>not</strong> be synced. See https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7652 for more info.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Use the <code>-P</code>/<code>--progress</code> flag to view real-time transfer statistics.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Use the <code>--dry-run</code> or the <code>--interactive</code>/<code>-i</code> flag to test without copying anything.</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy source:path dest:path [flags]</code></pre>

<h1 id="rclone-sync">rclone sync</h1>
<p>Make source and dest identical, modifying destination only.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-3">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only. Doesn't transfer files that are identical on source and destination, testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM. Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files if necessary (except duplicate objects, see below). If you don't want to delete files from destination, use the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/">copy</a> command instead.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the <code>--dry-run</code> or the <code>--interactive</code>/<code>-i</code> flag.</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive SOURCE remote:DESTINATION</code></pre>
<p>Note that files in the destination won't be deleted if there were any errors at any point. Duplicate objects (files with the same name, on those providers that support it) are also not yet handled.</p>
<p>It is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not the directory itself. So when source:path is a directory, it's the contents of source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents. See extended explanation in the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/">copy</a> command if unsure.</p>
<p>If dest:path doesn't exist, it is created and the source:path contents go there.</p>
<p>It is not possible to sync overlapping remotes. However, you may exclude the destination from the sync with a filter rule or by putting an exclude-if-present file inside the destination directory and sync to a destination that is inside the source directory.</p>
<p>Rclone will sync the modification times of files and directories if the backend supports it. If metadata syncing is required then use the <code>--metadata</code> flag.</p>
<p>Note that the modification time and metadata for the root directory will <strong>not</strong> be synced. See https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7652 for more info.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Use the <code>-P</code>/<code>--progress</code> flag to view real-time transfer statistics</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Use the <code>rclone dedupe</code> command to deal with "Duplicate object/directory found in source/destination - ignoring" errors. See <a href="https://forum.rclone.org/t/sync-not-clearing-duplicates/14372">this forum post</a> for more info.</p>
<h1 id="logger-flags">Logger Flags</h1>
<p>The <code>--differ</code>, <code>--missing-on-dst</code>, <code>--missing-on-src</code>, <code>--match</code> and <code>--error</code> flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or stdout if it is <code>-</code>) supplied. What they write is described in the help below. For example <code>--differ</code> will write all paths which are present on both the source and destination but different.</p>
<p>The <code>--combined</code> flag will write a file (or stdout) which contains all file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path to tell you what happened to it. These are reminiscent of diff files.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>= path</code> means path was found in source and destination and was identical</li>
<li>`- path` means path was missing on the source, so only in the destination</li>
<li>`+ path` means path was missing on the destination, so only in the source</li>
<li>`* path` means path was present in source and destination but different.</li>
<li><code>! path</code> means there was an error reading or hashing the source or dest.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>--dest-after</code> flag writes a list file using the same format flags as <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsf/#synopsis"><code>lsf</code></a> (including <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsf/#synopsis">customizable options for hash, modtime, etc.</a>) Conceptually it is similar to rsync's <code>--itemize-changes</code>, but not identical -- it should output an accurate list of what will be on the destination after the sync.</p>
<p>Note that these logger flags have a few limitations, and certain scenarios are not currently supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--max-duration</code> / <code>CutoffModeHard</code></li>
<li><code>--compare-dest</code> / <code>--copy-dest</code></li>
<li>server-side moves of an entire dir at once</li>
<li>High-level retries, because there would be duplicates (use <code>--retries 1</code> to disable)</li>
<li>Possibly some unusual error scenarios</li>
</ul>
<p>Note also that each file is logged during the sync, as opposed to after, so it is most useful as a predictor of what SHOULD happen to each file (which may or may not match what actually DID.)</p>

<h1 id="rclone-move">rclone move</h1>
<p>Move files from source to dest.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-4">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination directory. Rclone will error if the source and destination overlap and the remote does not support a server-side directory move operation.</p>
<p>To move single files, use the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_moveto/">moveto</a> command instead.</p>
<p>If no filters are in use and if possible this will server-side move <code>source:path</code> into <code>dest:path</code>. After this <code>source:path</code> will no longer exist.</p>
<p>Otherwise for each file in <code>source:path</code> selected by the filters (if any) this will move it into <code>dest:path</code>. If possible a server-side move will be used, otherwise it will copy it (server-side if possible) into <code>dest:path</code> then delete the original (if no errors on copy) in <code>source:path</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to delete empty source directories after move, use the <code>--delete-empty-src-dirs</code> flag.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#no-traverse">--no-traverse</a> option for controlling whether rclone lists the destination directory or not. Supplying this option when moving a small number of files into a large destination can speed transfers up greatly.</p>
<p>Rclone will sync the modification times of files and directories if the backend supports it. If metadata syncing is required then use the <code>--metadata</code> flag.</p>
<p>Note that the modification time and metadata for the root directory will <strong>not</strong> be synced. See https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7652 for more info.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the <code>--dry-run</code> or the <code>--interactive</code>/<code>-i</code> flag.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Use the <code>-P</code>/<code>--progress</code> flag to view real-time transfer statistics.</p>

<h1 id="rclone-delete">rclone delete</h1>
<p>Remove the files in path.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-5">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Remove the files in path. Unlike <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_purge/">purge</a> it obeys include/exclude filters so can be used to selectively delete files.</p>
<p><code>rclone delete</code> only deletes files but leaves the directory structure alone. If you want to delete a directory and all of its contents use the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_purge/">purge</a> command.</p>
<p>If you supply the <code>--rmdirs</code> flag, it will remove all empty directories along with it. You can also use the separate command <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rmdir/">rmdir</a> or <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rmdirs/">rmdirs</a> to delete empty directories only.</p>
<p>For example, to delete all files bigger than 100 MiB, you may first want to check what would be deleted (use either):</p>
<pre><code>rclone --min-size 100M lsl remote:path
rclone --dry-run --min-size 100M delete remote:path</code></pre>
<p>Then proceed with the actual delete:</p>
<pre><code>rclone --min-size 100M delete remote:path</code></pre>
<p>That reads "delete everything with a minimum size of 100 MiB", hence delete all files bigger than 100 MiB.</p>

<p>Remove the path and all of its contents.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-6">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Remove the path and all of its contents. Note that this does not obey include/exclude filters - everything will be removed. Use the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_delete/">delete</a> command if you want to selectively delete files. To delete empty directories only, use command <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rmdir/">rmdir</a> or <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rmdirs/">rmdirs</a>.</p>
<p>The concurrency of this operation is controlled by the <code>--checkers</code> global flag. However, some backends will implement this command directly, in which case <code>--checkers</code> will be ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the <code>--dry-run</code> or the <code>--interactive</code>/<code>-i</code> flag.</p>

<h1 id="rclone-check">rclone check</h1>
<p>Checks the files in the source and destination match.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-8">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Checks the files in the source and destination match. It compares sizes and hashes (MD5 or SHA1) and logs a report of files that don't match. It doesn't alter the source or destination.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://rclone.org/crypt/">crypt</a> remote there is a dedicated command, <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_cryptcheck/">cryptcheck</a>, that are able to check the checksums of the encrypted files.</p>
<p>If you supply the <code>--size-only</code> flag, it will only compare the sizes not the hashes as well. Use this for a quick check.</p>
<p>If you supply the <code>--download</code> flag, it will download the data from both remotes and check them against each other on the fly. This can be useful for remotes that don't support hashes or if you really want to check all the data.</p>
<p>If you supply the <code>--checkfile HASH</code> flag with a valid hash name, the <code>source:path</code> must point to a text file in the SUM format.</p>
<p>If you supply the <code>--one-way</code> flag, it will only check that files in the source match the files in the destination, not the other way around. This means that extra files in the destination that are not in the source will not be detected.</p>
<p>The <code>--differ</code>, <code>--missing-on-dst</code>, <code>--missing-on-src</code>, <code>--match</code> and <code>--error</code> flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or stdout if it is <code>-</code>) supplied. What they write is described in the help below. For example <code>--differ</code> will write all paths which are present on both the source and destination but different.</p>
<p>The <code>--combined</code> flag will write a file (or stdout) which contains all file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path to tell you what happened to it. These are reminiscent of diff files.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>= path</code> means path was found in source and destination and was identical</li>
<li>`- path` means path was missing on the source, so only in the destination</li>
<li>`+ path` means path was missing on the destination, so only in the source</li>
<li>`* path` means path was present in source and destination but different.</li>
<li><code>! path</code> means there was an error reading or hashing the source or dest.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default number of parallel checks is 8. See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#checkers-n">--checkers=N</a> option for more information.</p>

<p>Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.</p>
<p>There are several related list commands</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ls</code> to list size and path of objects only</li>
<li><code>lsl</code> to list modification time, size and path of objects only</li>
<li><code>lsd</code> to list directories only</li>
<li><code>lsf</code> to list objects and directories in easy to parse format</li>
<li><code>lsjson</code> to list objects and directories in JSON format</li>
</ul>
<p><code>ls</code>,<code>lsl</code>,<code>lsd</code> are designed to be human-readable. <code>lsf</code> is designed to be human and machine-readable. <code>lsjson</code> is designed to be machine-readable.</p>
<p>Note that <code>ls</code> and <code>lsl</code> recurse by default - use <code>--max-depth 1</code> to stop the recursion.</p>
<p>The other list commands <code>lsd</code>,<code>lsf</code>,<code>lsjson</code> do not recurse by default - use <code>-R</code> to make them recurse.</p>
<p>Listing a nonexistent directory will produce an error except for remotes which can't have empty directories (e.g. s3, swift, or gcs - the bucket-based remotes).</p>

<h1 id="rclone-dedupe">rclone dedupe</h1>
<p>Interactively find duplicate filenames and delete/rename them.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-17">Synopsis</h2>
<p>By default <code>dedupe</code> interactively finds files with duplicate names and offers to delete all but one or rename them to be different. This is known as deduping by name.</p>
<p>Deduping by name is only useful with a small group of backends (e.g. Google Drive, Opendrive) that can have duplicate file names. It can be run on wrapping backends (e.g. crypt) if they wrap a backend which supports duplicate file names.</p>
<p>However if <code>--by-hash</code> is passed in then dedupe will find files with duplicate hashes instead which will work on any backend which supports at least one hash. This can be used to find files with duplicate content. This is known as deduping by hash.</p>
<p>If deduping by name, first rclone will merge directories with the same name. It will do this iteratively until all the identically named directories have been merged.</p>
<p>Next, if deduping by name, for every group of duplicate file names / hashes, it will delete all but one identical file it finds without confirmation. This means that for most duplicated files the <code>dedupe</code> command will not be interactive.</p>
<p><code>dedupe</code> considers files to be identical if they have the same file path and the same hash. If the backend does not support hashes (e.g. crypt wrapping Google Drive) then they will never be found to be identical. If you use the <code>--size-only</code> flag then files will be considered identical if they have the same size (any hash will be ignored). This can be useful on crypt backends which do not support hashes.</p>
<p>Next rclone will resolve the remaining duplicates. Exactly which action is taken depends on the dedupe mode. By default, rclone will interactively query the user for each one.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the <code>--dry-run</code> or the <code>--interactive</code>/<code>-i</code> flag.</p>
<p>Here is an example run.</p>

<p>Dedupe can be run non interactively using the <code>--dedupe-mode</code> flag or by using an extra parameter with the same value</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--dedupe-mode interactive</code> - interactive as above.</li>
<li><code>--dedupe-mode skip</code> - removes identical files then skips anything left.</li>
<li><code>--dedupe-mode first</code> - removes identical files then keeps the first one.</li>
<li><code>--dedupe-mode newest</code> - removes identical files then keeps the newest one.</li>
<li><code>--dedupe-mode oldest</code> - removes identical files then keeps the oldest one.</li>
<li><code>--dedupe-mode largest</code> - removes identical files then keeps the largest one.</li>

<p>Remote authorization.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-19">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Remote authorization. Used to authorize a remote or headless rclone from a machine with a browser - use as instructed by rclone config.</p>
<p>The command requires 1-3 arguments: - fs name (e.g., "drive", "s3", etc.) - Either a base64 encoded JSON blob obtained from a previous rclone config session - Or a client_id and client_secret pair obtained from the remote service</p>
<p>Use --auth-no-open-browser to prevent rclone to open auth link in default browser automatically.</p>
<p>Use --template to generate HTML output via a custom Go template. If a blank string is provided as an argument to this flag, the default template is used.</p>

<p>Perform bidirectional synchronization between two paths.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-21">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Perform bidirectional synchronization between two paths.</p>
<p><a href="https://rclone.org/bisync/">Bisync</a> provides a bidirectional cloud sync solution in rclone. It retains the Path1 and Path2 filesystem listings from the prior run. On each successive run it will: - list files on Path1 and Path2, and check for changes on each side. Changes include <code>New</code>, <code>Newer</code>, <code>Older</code>, and <code>Deleted</code> files. - Propagate changes on Path1 to Path2, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Bisync is <strong>in beta</strong> and is considered an <strong>advanced command</strong>, so use with care. Make sure you have read and understood the entire <a href="https://rclone.org/bisync">manual</a> (especially the <a href="https://rclone.org/bisync/#limitations">Limitations</a> section) before using, or data loss can result. Questions can be asked in the <a href="https://forum.rclone.org/">Rclone Forum</a>.</p>

<p>Concatenates any files and sends them to stdout.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-22">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Sends any files to standard output.</p>
<p>You can use it like this to output a single file</p>
<pre><code>rclone cat remote:path/to/file</code></pre>
<p>Or like this to output any file in dir or its subdirectories.</p>
<pre><code>rclone cat remote:path/to/dir</code></pre>
<p>Or like this to output any .txt files in dir or its subdirectories.</p>
<pre><code>rclone --include &quot;*.txt&quot; cat remote:path/to/dir</code></pre>
<p>Use the <code>--head</code> flag to print characters only at the start, <code>--tail</code> for the end and <code>--offset</code> and <code>--count</code> to print a section in the middle. Note that if offset is negative it will count from the end, so <code>--offset -1 --count 1</code> is equivalent to <code>--tail 1</code>.</p>
<p>Use the <code>--separator</code> flag to print a separator value between files. Be sure to shell-escape special characters. For example, to print a newline between files, use:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>bash:</p>
<pre><code>rclone --include &quot;*.txt&quot; --separator $&#39;\n&#39; cat remote:path/to/dir</code></pre></li>
<li><p>powershell:</p>

<h1 id="rclone-checksum">rclone checksum</h1>
<p>Checks the files in the destination against a SUM file.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-23">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Checks that hashsums of destination files match the SUM file. It compares hashes (MD5, SHA1, etc) and logs a report of files which don't match. It doesn't alter the file system.</p>
<p>The sumfile is treated as the source and the dst:path is treated as the destination for the purposes of the output.</p>
<p>If you supply the <code>--download</code> flag, it will download the data from the remote and calculate the content hash on the fly. This can be useful for remotes that don't support hashes or if you really want to check all the data.</p>
<p>Note that hash values in the SUM file are treated as case insensitive.</p>
<p>If you supply the <code>--one-way</code> flag, it will only check that files in the source match the files in the destination, not the other way around. This means that extra files in the destination that are not in the source will not be detected.</p>
<p>The <code>--differ</code>, <code>--missing-on-dst</code>, <code>--missing-on-src</code>, <code>--match</code> and <code>--error</code> flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or stdout if it is <code>-</code>) supplied. What they write is described in the help below. For example <code>--differ</code> will write all paths which are present on both the source and destination but different.</p>
<p>The <code>--combined</code> flag will write a file (or stdout) which contains all file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path to tell you what happened to it. These are reminiscent of diff files.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>= path</code> means path was found in source and destination and was identical</li>
<li>`- path` means path was missing on the source, so only in the destination</li>
<li>`+ path` means path was missing on the destination, so only in the source</li>
<li>`* path` means path was present in source and destination but different.</li>
<li><code>! path</code> means there was an error reading or hashing the source or dest.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default number of parallel checks is 8. See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#checkers-n">--checkers=N</a> option for more information.</p>

<h1 id="rclone-config-create">rclone config create</h1>
<p>Create a new remote with name, type and options.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-29">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Create a new remote of <code>name</code> with <code>type</code> and options. The options should be passed in pairs of <code>key</code> <code>value</code> or as <code>key=value</code>.</p>
<p>For example, to make a swift remote of name myremote using auto config you would do:</p>
<pre><code>rclone config create myremote swift env_auth true
rclone config create myremote swift env_auth=true</code></pre>
<p>So for example if you wanted to configure a Google Drive remote but using remote authorization you would do this:</p>
<pre><code>rclone config create mydrive drive config_is_local=false</code></pre>
<p>Note that if the config process would normally ask a question the default is taken (unless <code>--non-interactive</code> is used). Each time that happens rclone will print or DEBUG a message saying how to affect the value taken.</p>
<p>If any of the parameters passed is a password field, then rclone will automatically obscure them if they aren't already obscured before putting them in the config file.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> If the password parameter is 22 characters or longer and consists only of base64 characters then rclone can get confused about whether the password is already obscured or not and put unobscured passwords into the config file. If you want to be 100% certain that the passwords get obscured then use the <code>--obscure</code> flag, or if you are 100% certain you are already passing obscured passwords then use <code>--no-obscure</code>. You can also set obscured passwords using the <code>rclone config password</code> command.</p>
<p>The flag <code>--non-interactive</code> is for use by applications that wish to configure rclone themselves, rather than using rclone's text based configuration questions. If this flag is set, and rclone needs to ask the user a question, a JSON blob will be returned with the question in it.</p>
<p>This will look something like (some irrelevant detail removed):</p>
<pre><code>{

<p>The format of <code>Option</code> is the same as returned by <code>rclone config providers</code>. The question should be asked to the user and returned to rclone as the <code>--result</code> option along with the <code>--state</code> parameter.</p>
<p>The keys of <code>Option</code> are used as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Name</code> - name of variable - show to user</li>
<li><code>Help</code> - help text. Hard wrapped at 80 chars. Any URLs should be clicky.</li>
<li><code>Default</code> - default value - return this if the user just wants the default.</li>
<li><code>Examples</code> - the user should be able to choose one of these</li>
<li><code>Required</code> - the value should be non-empty</li>
<li><code>IsPassword</code> - the value is a password and should be edited as such</li>
<li><code>Type</code> - type of value, eg <code>bool</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>int</code> and others</li>
<li><code>Exclusive</code> - if set no free-form entry allowed only the <code>Examples</code></li>
<li>Irrelevant keys <code>Provider</code>, <code>ShortOpt</code>, <code>Hide</code>, <code>NoPrefix</code>, <code>Advanced</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>Error</code> is set then it should be shown to the user at the same time as the question.</p>
<pre><code>rclone config update name --continue --state &quot;*oauth-islocal,teamdrive,,&quot; --result &quot;true&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Note that when using <code>--continue</code> all passwords should be passed in the clear (not obscured). Any default config values should be passed in with each invocation of <code>--continue</code>.</p>

<p>This command sets or changes the config file encryption password.</p>
<p>If there was no config password set then it sets a new one, otherwise it changes the existing config password.</p>
<p>Note that if you are changing an encryption password using <code>--password-command</code> then this will be called once to decrypt the config using the old password and then again to read the new password to re-encrypt the config.</p>
<p>When <code>--password-command</code> is called to change the password then the environment variable <code>RCLONE_PASSWORD_CHANGE=1</code> will be set. So if changing passwords programmatically you can use the environment variable to distinguish which password you must supply.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can remove the password first (with <code>rclone config encryption remove</code>), then set it again with this command which may be easier if you don't mind the unencrypted config file being on the disk briefly.</p>

<h1 id="rclone-config-update">rclone config update</h1>
<p>Update options in an existing remote.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-39">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Update an existing remote's options. The options should be passed in pairs of <code>key</code> <code>value</code> or as <code>key=value</code>.</p>
<p>For example, to update the env_auth field of a remote of name myremote you would do:</p>
<pre><code>rclone config update myremote env_auth true
rclone config update myremote env_auth=true</code></pre>
<p>If the remote uses OAuth the token will be updated, if you don't require this add an extra parameter thus:</p>
<pre><code>rclone config update myremote env_auth=true config_refresh_token=false</code></pre>
<p>Note that if the config process would normally ask a question the default is taken (unless <code>--non-interactive</code> is used). Each time that happens rclone will print or DEBUG a message saying how to affect the value taken.</p>
<p>If any of the parameters passed is a password field, then rclone will automatically obscure them if they aren't already obscured before putting them in the config file.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> If the password parameter is 22 characters or longer and consists only of base64 characters then rclone can get confused about whether the password is already obscured or not and put unobscured passwords into the config file. If you want to be 100% certain that the passwords get obscured then use the <code>--obscure</code> flag, or if you are 100% certain you are already passing obscured passwords then use <code>--no-obscure</code>. You can also set obscured passwords using the <code>rclone config password</code> command.</p>
<p>The flag <code>--non-interactive</code> is for use by applications that wish to configure rclone themselves, rather than using rclone's text based configuration questions. If this flag is set, and rclone needs to ask the user a question, a JSON blob will be returned with the question in it.</p>
<p>This will look something like (some irrelevant detail removed):</p>
<pre><code>{

        &quot;Default&quot;: true,
        &quot;Examples&quot;: [
            {

        &quot;Exclusive&quot;: true,
    },
    &quot;Error&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
}</code></pre>
<p>The format of <code>Option</code> is the same as returned by <code>rclone config providers</code>. The question should be asked to the user and returned to rclone as the <code>--result</code> option along with the <code>--state</code> parameter.</p>
<p>The keys of <code>Option</code> are used as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Name</code> - name of variable - show to user</li>
<li><code>Help</code> - help text. Hard wrapped at 80 chars. Any URLs should be clicky.</li>
<li><code>Default</code> - default value - return this if the user just wants the default.</li>
<li><code>Examples</code> - the user should be able to choose one of these</li>
<li><code>Required</code> - the value should be non-empty</li>
<li><code>IsPassword</code> - the value is a password and should be edited as such</li>
<li><code>Type</code> - type of value, eg <code>bool</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>int</code> and others</li>
<li><code>Exclusive</code> - if set no free-form entry allowed only the <code>Examples</code></li>
<li>Irrelevant keys <code>Provider</code>, <code>ShortOpt</code>, <code>Hide</code>, <code>NoPrefix</code>, <code>Advanced</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>Error</code> is set then it should be shown to the user at the same time as the question.</p>
<pre><code>rclone config update name --continue --state &quot;*oauth-islocal,teamdrive,,&quot; --result &quot;true&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Note that when using <code>--continue</code> all passwords should be passed in the clear (not obscured). Any default config values should be passed in with each invocation of <code>--continue</code>.</p>
<p>At the end of the non interactive process, rclone will return a result with <code>State</code> as empty string.</p>
<p>If <code>--all</code> is passed then rclone will ask all the config questions, not just the post config questions. Any parameters are used as defaults for questions as usual.</p>

<p>Multiple transformations can be used in sequence, applied in the order they are specified on the command line.</p>
<p>The <code>--name-transform</code> flag is also available in <code>sync</code>, <code>copy</code>, and <code>move</code>.</p>
<h1 id="files-vs-directories">Files vs Directories</h1>
<p>By default <code>--name-transform</code> will only apply to file names. The means only the leaf file name will be transformed. However some of the transforms would be better applied to the whole path or just directories. To choose which which part of the file path is affected some tags can be added to the <code>--name-transform</code></p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Tag</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>file</code></td>
<td>Only transform the leaf name of files (DEFAULT)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>dir</code></td>
<td>Only transform name of directories - these may appear anywhere in the path</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>all</code></td>
<td>Transform the entire path for files and directories</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is used by adding the tag into the transform name like this: <code>--name-transform file,prefix=ABC</code> or <code>--name-transform dir,prefix=DEF</code>.</p>
<p>For some conversions using all is more likely to be useful, for example <code>--name-transform all,nfc</code></p>
<p>Note that <code>--name-transform</code> may not add path separators <code>/</code> to the name. This will cause an error.</p>
<h1 id="ordering-and-conflicts">Ordering and Conflicts</h1>
<ul>
<li>Transformations will be applied in the order specified by the user.
<ul>
<li>If the <code>file</code> tag is in use (the default) then only the leaf name of files will be transformed.</li>
<li>If the <code>dir</code> tag is in use then directories anywhere in the path will be transformed</li>
<li>If the <code>all</code> tag is in use then directories and files anywhere in the path will be transformed</li>
<li>Each transformation will be run one path segment at a time.</li>
<li>If a transformation adds a <code>/</code> or ends up with an empty path segment then that will be an error.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is up to the user to put the transformations in a sensible order.
<ul>
<li>Conflicting transformations, such as <code>prefix</code> followed by <code>trimprefix</code> or <code>nfc</code> followed by <code>nfd</code>, are possible.</li>
<li>Instead of enforcing mutual exclusivity, transformations are applied in sequence as specified by the user, allowing for intentional use cases (e.g., trimming one prefix before adding another).</li>
<li>Users should be aware that certain combinations may lead to unexpected results and should verify transformations using <code>--dry-run</code> before execution.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="race-conditions-and-non-deterministic-behavior">Race Conditions and Non-Deterministic Behavior</h1>
<p>Some transformations, such as <code>replace=old:new</code>, may introduce conflicts where multiple source files map to the same destination name. This can lead to race conditions when performing concurrent transfers. It is up to the user to anticipate these. * If two files from the source are transformed into the same name at the destination, the final state may be non-deterministic. * Running rclone check after a sync using such transformations may erroneously report missing or differing files due to overwritten results.</p>
<ul>
<li>To minimize risks, users should:
<ul>
<li>Carefully review transformations that may introduce conflicts.</li>
<li>Use <code>--dry-run</code> to inspect changes before executing a sync (but keep in mind that it won't show the effect of non-deterministic transformations).</li>
<li>Avoid transformations that cause multiple distinct source files to map to the same destination name.</li>
<li>Consider disabling concurrency with <code>--transfers=1</code> if necessary.</li>
<li>Certain transformations (e.g. <code>prefix</code>) will have a multiplying effect every time they are used. Avoid these when using <code>bisync</code>.</li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="rclone-copyto">rclone copyto</h1>
<p>Copy files from source to dest, skipping identical files.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-42">Synopsis</h2>
<p>If source:path is a file or directory then it copies it to a file or directory named dest:path.</p>
<p>This can be used to upload single files to other than their current name. If the source is a directory then it acts exactly like the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/">copy</a> command.</p>
<p>So</p>
<pre><code>rclone copyto src dst</code></pre>
<p>where src and dst are rclone paths, either remote:path or /path/to/local or C:.</p>
<p>This will:</p>
<pre><code>if src is file
    copy it to dst, overwriting an existing file if it exists
if src is directory
    copy it to dst, overwriting existing files if they exist
    see copy command for full details</code></pre>
<p>This doesn't transfer files that are identical on src and dst, testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM. It doesn't delete files from the destination.</p>
<p><em>If you are looking to copy just a byte range of a file, please see 'rclone cat --offset X --count Y'</em></p>

<h1 id="rclone-cryptcheck">rclone cryptcheck</h1>
<p>Cryptcheck checks the integrity of an encrypted remote.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-44">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Checks a remote against a <a href="https://rclone.org/crypt/">crypted</a> remote. This is the equivalent of running rclone <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/">check</a>, but able to check the checksums of the encrypted remote.</p>
<p>For it to work the underlying remote of the cryptedremote must support some kind of checksum.</p>
<p>It works by reading the nonce from each file on the cryptedremote: and using that to encrypt each file on the remote:. It then checks the checksum of the underlying file on the cryptedremote: against the checksum of the file it has just encrypted.</p>
<p>Use it like this</p>
<pre><code>rclone cryptcheck /path/to/files encryptedremote:path</code></pre>
<p>You can use it like this also, but that will involve downloading all the files in remote:path.</p>
<pre><code>rclone cryptcheck remote:path encryptedremote:path</code></pre>
<p>After it has run it will log the status of the encryptedremote:.</p>
<p>If you supply the <code>--one-way</code> flag, it will only check that files in the source match the files in the destination, not the other way around. This means that extra files in the destination that are not in the source will not be detected.</p>
<p>The <code>--differ</code>, <code>--missing-on-dst</code>, <code>--missing-on-src</code>, <code>--match</code> and <code>--error</code> flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or stdout if it is <code>-</code>) supplied. What they write is described in the help below. For example <code>--differ</code> will write all paths which are present on both the source and destination but different.</p>
<p>The <code>--combined</code> flag will write a file (or stdout) which contains all file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path to tell you what happened to it. These are reminiscent of diff files.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>= path</code> means path was found in source and destination and was identical</li>
<li>`- path` means path was missing on the source, so only in the destination</li>
<li>`+ path` means path was missing on the destination, so only in the source</li>
<li>`* path` means path was present in source and destination but different.</li>
<li><code>! path</code> means there was an error reading or hashing the source or dest.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default number of parallel checks is 8. See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#checkers-n">--checkers=N</a> option for more information.</p>

<h1 id="rclone-lsf">rclone lsf</h1>
<p>List directories and objects in remote:path formatted for parsing.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-52">Synopsis</h2>
<p>List the contents of the source path (directories and objects) to standard output in a form which is easy to parse by scripts. By default this will just be the names of the objects and directories, one per line. The directories will have a / suffix.</p>
<p>Eg</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone lsf swift:bucket
bevajer5jef
canole
diwogej7
ferejej3gux/
fubuwic</code></pre>
<p>Use the <code>--format</code> option to control what gets listed. By default this is just the path, but you can use these parameters to control the output:</p>
<pre><code>p - path
s - size
t - modification time
h - hash
i - ID of object
o - Original ID of underlying object
m - MimeType of object if known
e - encrypted name
T - tier of storage if known, e.g. &quot;Hot&quot; or &quot;Cool&quot;
M - Metadata of object in JSON blob format, eg {&quot;key&quot;:&quot;value&quot;}</code></pre>
<p>So if you wanted the path, size and modification time, you would use <code>--format "pst"</code>, or maybe <code>--format "tsp"</code> to put the path last.</p>
<p>Eg</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone lsf  --format &quot;tsp&quot; swift:bucket
2016-06-25 18:55:41;60295;bevajer5jef

2018-04-26 08:50:45;0;ferejej3gux/
2016-06-25 18:55:40;37600;fubuwic</code></pre>
<p>If you specify "h" in the format you will get the MD5 hash by default, use the <code>--hash</code> flag to change which hash you want. Note that this can be returned as an empty string if it isn't available on the object (and for directories), "ERROR" if there was an error reading it from the object and "UNSUPPORTED" if that object does not support that hash type.</p>
<p>For example, to emulate the md5sum command you can use</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf -R --hash MD5 --format hp --separator &quot;  &quot; --files-only .</code></pre>
<p>Eg</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone lsf -R --hash MD5 --format hp --separator &quot;  &quot; --files-only swift:bucket

99713e14a4c4ff553acaf1930fad985b  gixacuh7ku</code></pre>
<p>(Though "rclone md5sum ." is an easier way of typing this.)</p>
<p>By default the separator is ";" this can be changed with the <code>--separator</code> flag. Note that separators aren't escaped in the path so putting it last is a good strategy.</p>
<p>Eg</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone lsf  --separator &quot;,&quot; --format &quot;tshp&quot; swift:bucket

<p>You can output in CSV standard format. This will escape things in " if they contain ,</p>
<p>Eg</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone lsf --csv --files-only --format ps remote:path
test.log,22355
test.sh,449
&quot;this file contains a comma, in the file name.txt&quot;,6</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>--absolute</code> parameter is useful for making lists of files to pass to an rclone copy with the <code>--files-from-raw</code> flag.</p>
<p>For example, to find all the files modified within one day and copy those only (without traversing the whole directory structure):</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf --absolute --files-only --max-age 1d /path/to/local &gt; new_files
rclone copy --files-from-raw new_files /path/to/local remote:path</code></pre>
<p>The default time format is <code>'2006-01-02 15:04:05'</code>. <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants">Other formats</a> can be specified with the <code>--time-format</code> flag. Examples:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf remote:path --format pt --time-format &#39;Jan 2, 2006 at 3:04pm (MST)&#39;
rclone lsf remote:path --format pt --time-format &#39;2006-01-02 15:04:05.000000000&#39;
rclone lsf remote:path --format pt --time-format &#39;2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00&#39;
rclone lsf remote:path --format pt --time-format RFC3339
rclone lsf remote:path --format pt --time-format DateOnly
rclone lsf remote:path --format pt --time-format max</code></pre>
<p><code>--time-format max</code> will automatically truncate '<code>2006-01-02 15:04:05.000000000</code>' to the maximum precision supported by the remote.</p>
<p>Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.</p>
<p>There are several related list commands</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ls</code> to list size and path of objects only</li>
<li><code>lsl</code> to list modification time, size and path of objects only</li>
<li><code>lsd</code> to list directories only</li>
<li><code>lsf</code> to list objects and directories in easy to parse format</li>
<li><code>lsjson</code> to list objects and directories in JSON format</li>
</ul>
<p><code>ls</code>,<code>lsl</code>,<code>lsd</code> are designed to be human-readable. <code>lsf</code> is designed to be human and machine-readable. <code>lsjson</code> is designed to be machine-readable.</p>
<p>Note that <code>ls</code> and <code>lsl</code> recurse by default - use <code>--max-depth 1</code> to stop the recursion.</p>
<p>The other list commands <code>lsd</code>,<code>lsf</code>,<code>lsjson</code> do not recurse by default - use <code>-R</code> to make them recurse.</p>
<p>Listing a nonexistent directory will produce an error except for remotes which can't have empty directories (e.g. s3, swift, or gcs - the bucket-based remotes).</p>

  &quot;Size&quot; : 6,
  &quot;Tier&quot; : &quot;hot&quot;,
}</code></pre>
<p>The exact set of properties included depends on the backend:</p>
<ul>
<li>The property IsBucket will only be included for bucket-based remotes, and only for directories that are buckets. It will always be omitted when value is not true.</li>
<li>Properties Encrypted and EncryptedPath will only be included for encrypted remotes, and (as mentioned below) only if the <code>--encrypted</code> option is set.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different options may also affect which properties are included:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>--hash</code> is not specified, the Hashes property will be omitted. The types of hash can be specified with the <code>--hash-type</code> parameter (which may be repeated). If <code>--hash-type</code> is set then it implies <code>--hash</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>--no-modtime</code> is specified then ModTime will be blank. This can speed things up on remotes where reading the ModTime takes an extra request (e.g. s3, swift).</li>
<li>If <code>--no-mimetype</code> is specified then MimeType will be blank. This can speed things up on remotes where reading the MimeType takes an extra request (e.g. s3, swift).</li>
<li>If <code>--encrypted</code> is not specified the Encrypted and EncryptedPath properties will be omitted - even for encrypted remotes.</li>
<li>If <code>--metadata</code> is set then an additional Metadata property will be returned. This will have <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata">metadata</a> in rclone standard format as a JSON object.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default is to list directories and files/objects, but this can be changed with the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>--dirs-only</code> is specified then directories will be returned only, no files/objects.</li>
<li>If <code>--files-only</code> is specified then files will be returned only, no directories.</li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>--stat</code> is set then the the output is not an array of items, but instead a single JSON blob will be returned about the item pointed to. This will return an error if the item isn't found, however on bucket based backends (like s3, gcs, b2, azureblob etc) if the item isn't found it will return an empty directory, as it isn't possible to tell empty directories from missing directories there.</p>
<p>The Path field will only show folders below the remote path being listed. If "remote:path" contains the file "subfolder/file.txt", the Path for "file.txt" will be "subfolder/file.txt", not "remote:path/subfolder/file.txt". When used without <code>--recursive</code> the Path will always be the same as Name.</p>
<p>The time is in RFC3339 format with up to nanosecond precision. The number of decimal digits in the seconds will depend on the precision that the remote can hold the times, so if times are accurate to the nearest millisecond (e.g. Google Drive) then 3 digits will always be shown ("2017-05-31T16:15:57.034+01:00") whereas if the times are accurate to the nearest second (Dropbox, Box, WebDav, etc.) no digits will be shown ("2017-05-31T16:15:57+01:00").</p>
<p>The whole output can be processed as a JSON blob, or alternatively it can be processed line by line as each item is written on individual lines (except with <code>--stat</code>).</p>
<p>Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.</p>
<p>There are several related list commands</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ls</code> to list size and path of objects only</li>
<li><code>lsl</code> to list modification time, size and path of objects only</li>
<li><code>lsd</code> to list directories only</li>
<li><code>lsf</code> to list objects and directories in easy to parse format</li>
<li><code>lsjson</code> to list objects and directories in JSON format</li>
</ul>
<p><code>ls</code>,<code>lsl</code>,<code>lsd</code> are designed to be human-readable. <code>lsf</code> is designed to be human and machine-readable. <code>lsjson</code> is designed to be machine-readable.</p>
<p>Note that <code>ls</code> and <code>lsl</code> recurse by default - use <code>--max-depth 1</code> to stop the recursion.</p>
<p>The other list commands <code>lsd</code>,<code>lsf</code>,<code>lsjson</code> do not recurse by default - use <code>-R</code> to make them recurse.</p>
<p>Listing a nonexistent directory will produce an error except for remotes which can't have empty directories (e.g. s3, swift, or gcs - the bucket-based remotes).</p>

<h1 id="rclone-mount">rclone mount</h1>
<p>Mount the remote as file system on a mountpoint.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-54">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Rclone mount allows Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows to mount any of Rclone's cloud storage systems as a file system with FUSE.</p>
<p>First set up your remote using <code>rclone config</code>. Check it works with <code>rclone ls</code> etc.</p>
<p>On Linux and macOS, you can run mount in either foreground or background (aka daemon) mode. Mount runs in foreground mode by default. Use the <code>--daemon</code> flag to force background mode. On Windows you can run mount in foreground only, the flag is ignored.</p>
<p>In background mode rclone acts as a generic Unix mount program: the main program starts, spawns background rclone process to setup and maintain the mount, waits until success or timeout and exits with appropriate code (killing the child process if it fails).</p>
<p>On Linux/macOS/FreeBSD start the mount like this, where <code>/path/to/local/mount</code> is an <strong>empty</strong> <strong>existing</strong> directory:</p>
<pre><code>rclone mount remote:path/to/files /path/to/local/mount</code></pre>
<p>On Windows you can start a mount in different ways. See <a href="#mounting-modes-on-windows">below</a> for details. If foreground mount is used interactively from a console window, rclone will serve the mount and occupy the console so another window should be used to work with the mount until rclone is interrupted e.g. by pressing Ctrl-C.</p>
<p>The following examples will mount to an automatically assigned drive, to specific drive letter <code>X:</code>, to path <code>C:\path\parent\mount</code> (where parent directory or drive must exist, and mount must <strong>not</strong> exist, and is not supported when <a href="#mounting-modes-on-windows">mounting as a network drive</a>), and the last example will mount as network share <code>\\cloud\remote</code> and map it to an automatically assigned drive:</p>
<pre><code>rclone mount remote:path/to/files *
rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:
rclone mount remote:path/to/files C:\path\parent\mount
rclone mount remote:path/to/files \\cloud\remote</code></pre>
<p>When the program ends while in foreground mode, either via Ctrl+C or receiving a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, the mount should be automatically stopped.</p>
<p>When running in background mode the user will have to stop the mount manually:</p>
<pre><code># Linux
fusermount -u /path/to/local/mount
#... or on some systems
fusermount3 -u /path/to/local/mount
# OS X or Linux when using nfsmount
umount /path/to/local/mount</code></pre>
<p>The umount operation can fail, for example when the mountpoint is busy. When that happens, it is the user's responsibility to stop the mount manually.</p>
<p>The size of the mounted file system will be set according to information retrieved from the remote, the same as returned by the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/">rclone about</a> command. Remotes with unlimited storage may report the used size only, then an additional 1 PiB of free space is assumed. If the remote does not <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">support</a> the about feature at all, then 1 PiB is set as both the total and the free size.</p>
<h2 id="installing-on-windows">Installing on Windows</h2>
<p>To run rclone mount on Windows, you will need to download and install <a href="http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/">WinFsp</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp">WinFsp</a> is an open-source Windows File System Proxy which makes it easy to write user space file systems for Windows. It provides a FUSE emulation layer which rclone uses combination with <a href="https://github.com/winfsp/cgofuse">cgofuse</a>. Both of these packages are by Bill Zissimopoulos who was very helpful during the implementation of rclone mount for Windows.</p>
<h3 id="mounting-modes-on-windows">Mounting modes on windows</h3>
<p>Unlike other operating systems, Microsoft Windows provides a different filesystem type for network and fixed drives. It optimises access on the assumption fixed disk drives are fast and reliable, while network drives have relatively high latency and less reliability. Some settings can also be differentiated between the two types, for example that Windows Explorer should just display icons and not create preview thumbnails for image and video files on network drives.</p>
<p>In most cases, rclone will mount the remote as a normal, fixed disk drive by default. However, you can also choose to mount it as a remote network drive, often described as a network share. If you mount an rclone remote using the default, fixed drive mode and experience unexpected program errors, freezes or other issues, consider mounting as a network drive instead.</p>
<p>When mounting as a fixed disk drive you can either mount to an unused drive letter, or to a path representing a <strong>nonexistent</strong> subdirectory of an <strong>existing</strong> parent directory or drive. Using the special value <code>*</code> will tell rclone to automatically assign the next available drive letter, starting with Z: and moving backward. Examples:</p>
<pre><code>rclone mount remote:path/to/files *
rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:
rclone mount remote:path/to/files C:\path\parent\mount
rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:</code></pre>
<p>Option <code>--volname</code> can be used to set a custom volume name for the mounted file system. The default is to use the remote name and path.</p>
<p>To mount as network drive, you can add option <code>--network-mode</code> to your mount command. Mounting to a directory path is not supported in this mode, it is a limitation Windows imposes on junctions, so the remote must always be mounted to a drive letter.</p>
<pre><code>rclone mount remote:path/to/files X: --network-mode</code></pre>
<p>A volume name specified with <code>--volname</code> will be used to create the network share path. A complete UNC path, such as <code>\\cloud\remote</code>, optionally with path <code>\\cloud\remote\madeup\path</code>, will be used as is. Any other string will be used as the share part, after a default prefix <code>\\server\</code>. If no volume name is specified then <code>\\server\share</code> will be used. You must make sure the volume name is unique when you are mounting more than one drive, or else the mount command will fail. The share name will treated as the volume label for the mapped drive, shown in Windows Explorer etc, while the complete <code>\\server\share</code> will be reported as the remote UNC path by <code>net use</code> etc, just like a normal network drive mapping.</p>
<p>If you specify a full network share UNC path with <code>--volname</code>, this will implicitly set the <code>--network-mode</code> option, so the following two examples have same result:</p>
<pre><code>rclone mount remote:path/to/files X: --network-mode
rclone mount remote:path/to/files X: --volname \\server\share</code></pre>
<p>You may also specify the network share UNC path as the mountpoint itself. Then rclone will automatically assign a drive letter, same as with <code>*</code> and use that as mountpoint, and instead use the UNC path specified as the volume name, as if it were specified with the <code>--volname</code> option. This will also implicitly set the <code>--network-mode</code> option. This means the following two examples have same result:</p>
<pre><code>rclone mount remote:path/to/files \\cloud\remote
rclone mount remote:path/to/files * --volname \\cloud\remote</code></pre>
<p>There is yet another way to enable network mode, and to set the share path, and that is to pass the "native" libfuse/WinFsp option directly: <code>--fuse-flag --VolumePrefix=\server\share</code>. Note that the path must be with just a single backslash prefix in this case.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> In previous versions of rclone this was the only supported method.</p>

<h3 id="windows-filesystem-permissions">Windows filesystem permissions</h3>
<p>The FUSE emulation layer on Windows must convert between the POSIX-based permission model used in FUSE, and the permission model used in Windows, based on access-control lists (ACL).</p>
<p>The mounted filesystem will normally get three entries in its access-control list (ACL), representing permissions for the POSIX permission scopes: Owner, group and others. By default, the owner and group will be taken from the current user, and the built-in group "Everyone" will be used to represent others. The user/group can be customized with FUSE options "UserName" and "GroupName", e.g. <code>-o UserName=user123 -o GroupName="Authenticated Users"</code>. The permissions on each entry will be set according to <a href="#options">options</a> <code>--dir-perms</code> and <code>--file-perms</code>, which takes a value in traditional Unix <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions#Numeric_notation">numeric notation</a>.</p>
<p>The default permissions corresponds to <code>--file-perms 0666 --dir-perms 0777</code>, i.e. read and write permissions to everyone. This means you will not be able to start any programs from the mount. To be able to do that you must add execute permissions, e.g. <code>--file-perms 0777 --dir-perms 0777</code> to add it to everyone. If the program needs to write files, chances are you will have to enable <a href="#vfs-file-caching">VFS File Caching</a> as well (see also <a href="#limitations">limitations</a>). Note that the default write permission have some restrictions for accounts other than the owner, specifically it lacks the "write extended attributes", as explained next.</p>
<p>The mapping of permissions is not always trivial, and the result you see in Windows Explorer may not be exactly like you expected. For example, when setting a value that includes write access for the group or others scope, this will be mapped to individual permissions "write attributes", "write data" and "append data", but not "write extended attributes". Windows will then show this as basic permission "Special" instead of "Write", because "Write" also covers the "write extended attributes" permission. When setting digit 0 for group or others, to indicate no permissions, they will still get individual permissions "read attributes", "read extended attributes" and "read permissions". This is done for compatibility reasons, e.g. to allow users without additional permissions to be able to read basic metadata about files like in Unix.</p>
<p>WinFsp 2021 (version 1.9) introduced a new FUSE option "FileSecurity", that allows the complete specification of file security descriptors using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-string-format">SDDL</a>. With this you get detailed control of the resulting permissions, compared to use of the POSIX permissions described above, and no additional permissions will be added automatically for compatibility with Unix. Some example use cases will following.</p>
<p>If you set POSIX permissions for only allowing access to the owner, using <code>--file-perms 0600 --dir-perms 0700</code>, the user group and the built-in "Everyone" group will still be given some special permissions, as described above. Some programs may then (incorrectly) interpret this as the file being accessible by everyone, for example an SSH client may warn about "unprotected private key file". You can work around this by specifying <code>-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FA;;;OW)"</code>, which sets file all access (FA) to the owner (OW), and nothing else.</p>
<p>When setting write permissions then, except for the owner, this does not include the "write extended attributes" permission, as mentioned above. This may prevent applications from writing to files, giving permission denied error instead. To set working write permissions for the built-in "Everyone" group, similar to what it gets by default but with the addition of the "write extended attributes", you can specify <code>-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FRFW;;;WD)"</code>, which sets file read (FR) and file write (FW) to everyone (WD). If file execute (FX) is also needed, then change to <code>-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FRFWFX;;;WD)"</code>, or set file all access (FA) to get full access permissions, including delete, with <code>-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FA;;;WD)"</code>.</p>
<h3 id="windows-caveats">Windows caveats</h3>
<p>Drives created as Administrator are not visible to other accounts, not even an account that was elevated to Administrator with the User Account Control (UAC) feature. A result of this is that if you mount to a drive letter from a Command Prompt run as Administrator, and then try to access the same drive from Windows Explorer (which does not run as Administrator), you will not be able to see the mounted drive.</p>
<p>If you don't need to access the drive from applications running with administrative privileges, the easiest way around this is to always create the mount from a non-elevated command prompt.</p>
<p>To make mapped drives available to the user account that created them regardless if elevated or not, there is a special Windows setting called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/networking/mapped-drives-not-available-from-elevated-command#detail-to-configure-the-enablelinkedconnections-registry-entry">linked connections</a> that can be enabled.</p>
<p>It is also possible to make a drive mount available to everyone on the system, by running the process creating it as the built-in SYSTEM account. There are several ways to do this: One is to use the command-line utility <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec">PsExec</a>, from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite, which has option <code>-s</code> to start processes as the SYSTEM account. Another alternative is to run the mount command from a Windows Scheduled Task, or a Windows Service, configured to run as the SYSTEM account. A third alternative is to use the <a href="https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp/wiki/WinFsp-Service-Architecture">WinFsp.Launcher infrastructure</a>). Read more in the <a href="https://rclone.org/install/">install documentation</a>. Note that when running rclone as another user, it will not use the configuration file from your profile unless you tell it to with the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#config-config-file"><code>--config</code></a> option. Note also that it is now the SYSTEM account that will have the owner permissions, and other accounts will have permissions according to the group or others scopes. As mentioned above, these will then not get the "write extended attributes" permission, and this may prevent writing to files. You can work around this with the FileSecurity option, see example above.</p>
<p>Note that mapping to a directory path, instead of a drive letter, does not suffer from the same limitations.</p>
<h2 id="mounting-on-macos">Mounting on macOS</h2>
<p>Mounting on macOS can be done either via <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_nfs/">built-in NFS server</a>, <a href="https://osxfuse.github.io/">macFUSE</a> (also known as osxfuse) or <a href="https://www.fuse-t.org/">FUSE-T</a>. macFUSE is a traditional FUSE driver utilizing a macOS kernel extension (kext). FUSE-T is an alternative FUSE system which "mounts" via an NFSv4 local server.</p>
<h4 id="unicode-normalization">Unicode Normalization</h4>
<p>It is highly recommended to keep the default of <code>--no-unicode-normalization=false</code> for all <code>mount</code> and <code>serve</code> commands on macOS. For details, see <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#vfs-case-sensitivity">vfs-case-sensitivity</a>.</p>
<h3 id="nfs-mount">NFS mount</h3>
<p>This method spins up an NFS server using <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_nfs/">serve nfs</a> command and mounts it to the specified mountpoint. If you run this in background mode using |--daemon|, you will need to send SIGTERM signal to the rclone process using |kill| command to stop the mount.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--nfs-cache-handle-limit</code> controls the maximum number of cached file handles stored by the <code>nfsmount</code> caching handler. This should not be set too low or you may experience errors when trying to access files. The default is 1000000, but consider lowering this limit if the server's system resource usage causes problems.</p>
<h3 id="macfuse-notes">macFUSE Notes</h3>
<p>If installing macFUSE using <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/releases">dmg packages</a> from the website, rclone will locate the macFUSE libraries without any further intervention. If however, macFUSE is installed using the <a href="https://www.macports.org/">macports</a> package manager, the following addition steps are required.</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib
cd /usr/local/lib
sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/libfuse.2.dylib</code></pre>
<h3 id="fuse-t-limitations-caveats-and-notes">FUSE-T Limitations, Caveats, and Notes</h3>
<p>There are some limitations, caveats, and notes about how it works. These are current as of FUSE-T version 1.0.14.</p>
<h4 id="modtime-update-on-read">ModTime update on read</h4>
<p>As per the <a href="https://github.com/macos-fuse-t/fuse-t/wiki#caveats">FUSE-T wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>File access and modification times cannot be set separately as it seems to be an issue with the NFS client which always modifies both. Can be reproduced with 'touch -m' and 'touch -a' commands</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that viewing files with various tools, notably macOS Finder, will cause rlcone to update the modification time of the file. This may make rclone upload a full new copy of the file.</p>
<h4 id="read-only-mounts">Read Only mounts</h4>
<p>When mounting with <code>--read-only</code>, attempts to write to files will fail <em>silently</em> as opposed to with a clear warning as in macFUSE.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Without the use of <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> this can only write files sequentially, it can only seek when reading. This means that many applications won't work with their files on an rclone mount without <code>--vfs-cache-mode writes</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-mode full</code>. See the <a href="#vfs-file-caching">VFS File Caching</a> section for more info. When using NFS mount on macOS, if you don't specify |--vfs-cache-mode| the mount point will be read-only.</p>
<p>The bucket-based remotes (e.g. Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2) do not support the concept of empty directories, so empty directories will have a tendency to disappear once they fall out of the directory cache.</p>
<p>When <code>rclone mount</code> is invoked on Unix with <code>--daemon</code> flag, the main rclone program will wait for the background mount to become ready or until the timeout specified by the <code>--daemon-wait</code> flag. On Linux it can check mount status using ProcFS so the flag in fact sets <strong>maximum</strong> time to wait, while the real wait can be less. On macOS / BSD the time to wait is constant and the check is performed only at the end. We advise you to set wait time on macOS reasonably.</p>
<p>Only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OS X and Windows at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="rclone-mount-vs-rclone-synccopy">rclone mount vs rclone sync/copy</h2>
<p>File systems expect things to be 100% reliable, whereas cloud storage systems are a long way from 100% reliable. The rclone sync/copy commands cope with this with lots of retries. However rclone mount can't use retries in the same way without making local copies of the uploads. Look at the <a href="#vfs-file-caching">VFS File Caching</a> for solutions to make mount more reliable.</p>
<h2 id="attribute-caching">Attribute caching</h2>
<p>You can use the flag <code>--attr-timeout</code> to set the time the kernel caches the attributes (size, modification time, etc.) for directory entries.</p>
<p>The default is <code>1s</code> which caches files just long enough to avoid too many callbacks to rclone from the kernel.</p>
<p>In theory 0s should be the correct value for filesystems which can change outside the control of the kernel. However this causes quite a few problems such as <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2157">rclone using too much memory</a>, <a href="https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-1-39-vs-1-40-mount-issue/5112">rclone not serving files to samba</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2095#issuecomment-371141147">excessive time listing directories</a>.</p>
<p>The kernel can cache the info about a file for the time given by <code>--attr-timeout</code>. You may see corruption if the remote file changes length during this window. It will show up as either a truncated file or a file with garbage on the end. With <code>--attr-timeout 1s</code> this is very unlikely but not impossible. The higher you set <code>--attr-timeout</code> the more likely it is. The default setting of "1s" is the lowest setting which mitigates the problems above.</p>
<p>If you set it higher (<code>10s</code> or <code>1m</code> say) then the kernel will call back to rclone less often making it more efficient, however there is more chance of the corruption issue above.</p>
<p>If files don't change on the remote outside of the control of rclone then there is no chance of corruption.</p>
<p>This is the same as setting the attr_timeout option in mount.fuse.</p>
<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>
<p>Note that all the rclone filters can be used to select a subset of the files to be visible in the mount.</p>
<h2 id="systemd">systemd</h2>
<p>When running rclone mount as a systemd service, it is possible to use Type=notify. In this case the service will enter the started state after the mountpoint has been successfully set up. Units having the rclone mount service specified as a requirement will see all files and folders immediately in this mode.</p>
<p>Note that systemd runs mount units without any environment variables including <code>PATH</code> or <code>HOME</code>. This means that tilde (<code>~</code>) expansion will not work and you should provide <code>--config</code> and <code>--cache-dir</code> explicitly as absolute paths via rclone arguments. Since mounting requires the <code>fusermount</code> or <code>fusermount3</code> program, rclone will use the fallback PATH of <code>/bin:/usr/bin</code> in this scenario. Please ensure that <code>fusermount</code>/<code>fusermount3</code> is present on this PATH.</p>
<h2 id="rclone-as-unix-mount-helper">Rclone as Unix mount helper</h2>
<p>The core Unix program <code>/bin/mount</code> normally takes the <code>-t FSTYPE</code> argument then runs the <code>/sbin/mount.FSTYPE</code> helper program passing it mount options as <code>-o key=val,...</code> or <code>--opt=...</code>. Automount (classic or systemd) behaves in a similar way.</p>
<p>rclone by default expects GNU-style flags <code>--key val</code>. To run it as a mount helper you should symlink rclone binary to <code>/sbin/mount.rclone</code> and optionally <code>/usr/bin/rclonefs</code>, e.g. <code>ln -s /usr/bin/rclone /sbin/mount.rclone</code>. rclone will detect it and translate command-line arguments appropriately.</p>
<p>Now you can run classic mounts like this:</p>
<pre><code>mount sftp1:subdir /mnt/data -t rclone -o vfs_cache_mode=writes,sftp_key_file=/path/to/pem</code></pre>
<p>or create systemd mount units:</p>
<pre><code># /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.mount
[Unit]
Description=Mount for /mnt/data
[Mount]
Type=rclone
What=sftp1:subdir
Where=/mnt/data
Options=rw,_netdev,allow_other,args2env,vfs-cache-mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache-dir=/var/rclone</code></pre>
<p>optionally accompanied by systemd automount unit</p>
<pre><code># /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.automount
[Unit]
Description=AutoMount for /mnt/data
[Automount]
Where=/mnt/data
TimeoutIdleSec=600
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>
<p>or add in <code>/etc/fstab</code> a line like</p>
<pre><code>sftp1:subdir /mnt/data rclone rw,noauto,nofail,_netdev,x-systemd.automount,args2env,vfs_cache_mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache_dir=/var/cache/rclone 0 0</code></pre>
<p>or use classic Automountd. Remember to provide explicit <code>config=...,cache-dir=...</code> as a workaround for mount units being run without <code>HOME</code>.</p>
<p>Rclone in the mount helper mode will split <code>-o</code> argument(s) by comma, replace <code>_</code> by <code>-</code> and prepend <code>--</code> to get the command-line flags. Options containing commas or spaces can be wrapped in single or double quotes. Any inner quotes inside outer quotes of the same type should be doubled.</p>
<p>Mount option syntax includes a few extra options treated specially:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>env.NAME=VALUE</code> will set an environment variable for the mount process. This helps with Automountd and Systemd.mount which don't allow setting custom environment for mount helpers. Typically you will use <code>env.HTTPS_PROXY=proxy.host:3128</code> or <code>env.HOME=/root</code></li>
<li><code>command=cmount</code> can be used to run <code>cmount</code> or any other rclone command rather than the default <code>mount</code>.</li>
<li><code>args2env</code> will pass mount options to the mount helper running in background via environment variables instead of command line arguments. This allows to hide secrets from such commands as <code>ps</code> or <code>pgrep</code>.</li>
<li><code>vv...</code> will be transformed into appropriate <code>--verbose=N</code></li>
<li>standard mount options like <code>x-systemd.automount</code>, <code>_netdev</code>, <code>nosuid</code> and alike are intended only for Automountd and ignored by rclone.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vfs---virtual-file-system">VFS - Virtual File System</h2>
<p>This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing system.</p>
<p>Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various options explained below.</p>
<p>The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-directory-cache">VFS Directory Cache</h2>
<p>Using the <code>--dir-cache-time</code> flag, you can control how long a directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the cache.</p>
<pre><code>--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)</code></pre>
<p>However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the polling interval.</p>
<p>You can send a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to rclone for it to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:</p>
<pre><code>kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)</code></pre>
<p>If you configure rclone with a <a href="/rc">remote control</a> then you can use rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget</code></pre>
<p>Or individual files or directories:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir</code></pre>
<h2 id="vfs-file-buffering">VFS File Buffering</h2>
<p>The <code>--buffer-size</code> flag determines the amount of memory, that will be used to buffer data in advance.</p>
<p>Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be shared.</p>
<p>This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.</p>
<p>The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to <code>--buffer-size * open files</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-file-caching">VFS File Caching</h2>
<p>These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.</p>
<p>For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.</p>
<p>Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may find that you need one or the other or both.</p>
<pre><code>--cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)</code></pre>
<p>If run with <code>-vv</code> rclone will print the location of the file cache. The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but can be controlled with <code>--cache-dir</code> or setting the appropriate environment variable.</p>
<p>The cache has 4 different modes selected by <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code>. The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using disk space.</p>
<p>Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed and if they haven't been accessed for <code>--vfs-write-back</code> seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.</p>
<p>If using <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> note that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every <code>--vfs-cache-poll-interval</code>. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> is exceeded, rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant files are likely to remain cached.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-cache-max-age</code> will evict files from the cache after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of 1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0 and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .</p>
<p>You <strong>should not</strong> run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using <code>--vfs-cache-mode &gt; off</code>. This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with <code>--cache-dir</code>. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-off">--vfs-cache-mode off</h3>
<p>In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.</p>
<p>This will mean some operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files can't be opened for both read AND write</li>
<li>Files opened for write can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only</li>
<li>Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied</li>
<li>Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-minimal">--vfs-cache-mode minimal</h3>
<p>This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.</p>
<p>These operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files opened for write only can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-writes">--vfs-cache-mode writes</h3>
<p>In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations.</p>
<p>If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing intervals up to 1 minute.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-full">--vfs-cache-mode full</h3>
<p>In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.</p>
<p>In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.</p>
<p>So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present in them.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations and is otherwise identical to <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> writes.</p>
<p>When reading a file rclone will read <code>--buffer-size</code> plus <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> bytes ahead. The <code>--buffer-size</code> is buffered in memory whereas the <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is buffered on disk.</p>
<p>When using this mode it is recommended that <code>--buffer-size</code> is not set too large and <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is set large if required.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> not all file systems support sparse files. In particular FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message if one is detected.</p>
<h3 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</h3>
<p>Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made from:</p>
<ul>
<li>size</li>
<li>modification time</li>
<li>hash</li>
</ul>
<p>where available on an object.</p>
<p>On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).</p>
<p>For example <code>hash</code> is slow with the <code>local</code> and <code>sftp</code> backends as they have to read the entire file and hash it, and <code>modtime</code> is slow with the <code>s3</code>, <code>swift</code>, <code>ftp</code> and <code>qinqstor</code> backends because they need to do an extra API call to fetch it.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-fast-fingerprint</code> flag then rclone will not include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the opening time of cached files.</p>
<p>If you are running a vfs cache over <code>local</code>, <code>s3</code> or <code>swift</code> backends then using this flag is recommended.</p>
<p>Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to be downloaded again.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-chunked-reading">VFS Chunked Reading</h2>
<p>When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.</p>
<p>These flags control the chunking:</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
--vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once</code></pre>
<p>The chunking behaves differently depending on the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> parameter.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> == 0</h3>
<p>Rclone will start reading a chunk of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, and then double the size for each read. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit</code> is specified, and greater than <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, the chunk size for each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.</p>
<p>With <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0</code> the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M</code> is specified, the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.</p>
<p>Setting <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> to <code>0</code> or "off" disables chunked reading.</p>
<p>The chunks will not be buffered in memory.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-1"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> &gt; 0</h3>
<p>Rclone reads <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> chunks of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> concurrently. The size for each read will stay constant.</p>
<p>This improves performance performance massively on high latency links or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.</p>
<p>Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> as these will depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.</p>
<p>For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to start might be <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M</code>. In testing with AWS S3 the performance scaled roughly as the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> setting.</p>
<p>Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on the latency they may need more <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> in order to get the throughput.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-performance">VFS Performance</h2>
<p>These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for performance or other reasons. See also the <a href="#vfs-chunked-reading">chunked reading</a> feature.</p>
<p>In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the <code>--no-modtime</code> flag (or use <code>--use-server-modtime</code> for a slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a transaction.</p>
<pre><code>--no-checksum     Don&#39;t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don&#39;t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don&#39;t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)</code></pre>
<p>When using VFS write caching (<code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> with value writes or full), the global flag <code>--transfers</code> can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache (the related global flag <code>--checkers</code> has no effect on the VFS).</p>
<pre><code>--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)</code></pre>
<h2 id="symlinks">Symlinks</h2>
<p>By default the VFS does not support symlinks. However this may be enabled with either of the following flags:</p>
<pre><code>--links      Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension.
--vfs-links  Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension for the VFS</code></pre>
<p>As most cloud storage systems do not support symlinks directly, rclone stores the symlink as a normal file with a special extension. So a file which appears as a symlink <code>link-to-file.txt</code> would be stored on cloud storage as <code>link-to-file.txt.rclonelink</code> and the contents would be the path to the symlink destination.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--links</code> enables symlink translation globally in rclone - this includes any backend which supports the concept (for example the local backend). <code>--vfs-links</code> just enables it for the VFS layer.</p>
<p>This scheme is compatible with that used by the <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#symlinks-junction-points">local backend with the --local-links flag</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-links</code> flag has been designed for <code>rclone mount</code>, <code>rclone nfsmount</code> and <code>rclone serve nfs</code>.</p>
<p>It hasn't been tested with the other <code>rclone serve</code> commands yet.</p>
<p>A limitation of the current implementation is that it expects the caller to resolve sub-symlinks. For example given this directory tree</p>
<pre><code>.
├── dir
│   └── file.txt
└── linked-dir -&gt; dir</code></pre>
<p>The VFS will correctly resolve <code>linked-dir</code> but not <code>linked-dir/file.txt</code>. This is not a problem for the tested commands but may be for other commands.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that there is an outstanding issue with symlink support <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8245">issue #8245</a> with duplicate files being created when symlinks are moved into directories where there is a file of the same name (or vice versa).</p>
<h2 id="vfs-case-sensitivity">VFS Case Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.</p>
<p>File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.</p>
<p>Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-case-insensitive</code> VFS flag controls how rclone handles these two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.</p>
<p>The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by the underlying remote.</p>
<p>Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.</p>
<p>If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".</p>
<p>The <code>--no-unicode-normalization</code> flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is performed for filenames that differ but are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">canonically equivalent</a> with respect to unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS, which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is therefore highly recommended to keep the default of <code>false</code> on macOS, to avoid encoding compatibility issues.</p>
<p>In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the <code>--vfs-block-norm-dupes</code> flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount, and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. <code>--vfs-block- norm-dupes</code> prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in <code>rclone sync</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-disk-options">VFS Disk Options</h2>
<p>This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system. It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)</code></pre>
<h2 id="alternate-report-of-used-bytes">Alternate report of used bytes</h2>
<p>Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used. If you need this information to be available when running <code>df</code> on the filesystem, then pass the flag <code>--vfs-used-is-size</code> to rclone. With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to <code>rclone size</code> and compute the total used space itself.</p>
<p><em>WARNING.</em> Contrary to <code>rclone size</code>, this flag ignores filters so that the result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-metadata">VFS Metadata</h2>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-metadata-extension</code> flag you can get the VFS to expose files which contain the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata">metadata</a> as a JSON blob. These files will not appear in the directory listing, but can be <code>stat</code>-ed and opened and once they have been they <strong>will</strong> appear in directory listings until the directory cache expires.</p>
<p>Note that some backends won't create metadata unless you pass in the <code>--metadata</code> flag.</p>
<p>For example, using <code>rclone mount</code> with <code>--metadata --vfs-metadata-extension .metadata</code> we get</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l /mnt/
total 1048577
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1073741824 Mar  3 16:03 1G

<h1 id="rclone-moveto">rclone moveto</h1>
<p>Move file or directory from source to dest.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-55">Synopsis</h2>
<p>If source:path is a file or directory then it moves it to a file or directory named dest:path.</p>
<p>This can be used to rename files or upload single files to other than their existing name. If the source is a directory then it acts exactly like the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/">move</a> command.</p>
<p>So</p>
<pre><code>rclone moveto src dst</code></pre>
<p>where src and dst are rclone paths, either remote:path or /path/to/local or C:.</p>
<p>This will:</p>
<pre><code>if src is file
    move it to dst, overwriting an existing file if it exists
if src is directory
    move it to dst, overwriting existing files if they exist
    see move command for full details</code></pre>
<p>This doesn't transfer files that are identical on src and dst, testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM. src will be deleted on successful transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the <code>--dry-run</code> or the <code>--interactive</code>/<code>-i</code> flag.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Use the <code>-P</code>/<code>--progress</code> flag to view real-time transfer statistics.</p>

<h1 id="rclone-ncdu">rclone ncdu</h1>
<p>Explore a remote with a text based user interface.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-56">Synopsis</h2>
<p>This displays a text based user interface allowing the navigation of a remote. It is most useful for answering the question - "What is using all my disk space?".</p>
<p>To make the user interface it first scans the entire remote given and builds an in memory representation. rclone ncdu can be used during this scanning phase and you will see it building up the directory structure as it goes along.</p>
<p>You can interact with the user interface using key presses, press '?' to toggle the help on and off. The supported keys are:</p>
<pre><code> ↑,↓ or k,j to Move
 →,l to enter
 ←,h to return
 g toggle graph
 c toggle counts
 a toggle average size in directory
 m toggle modified time
 u toggle human-readable format
 n,s,C,A,M sort by name,size,count,asize,mtime
 d delete file/directory
 v select file/directory
 V enter visual select mode
 D delete selected files/directories
 y copy current path to clipboard
 Y display current path
 ^L refresh screen (fix screen corruption)
 r recalculate file sizes
 ? to toggle help on and off
 ESC to close the menu box
 q/^c to quit</code></pre>
<p>Listed files/directories may be prefixed by a one-character flag, some of them combined with a description in brackets at end of line. These flags have the following meaning:</p>
<pre><code>e means this is an empty directory, i.e. contains no files (but
  may contain empty subdirectories)
~ means this is a directory where some of the files (possibly in
  subdirectories) have unknown size, and therefore the directory
  size may be underestimated (and average size inaccurate, as it
  is average of the files with known sizes).
. means an error occurred while reading a subdirectory, and
  therefore the directory size may be underestimated (and average
  size inaccurate)
! means an error occurred while reading this directory</code></pre>
<p>This an homage to the <a href="https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu">ncdu tool</a> but for rclone remotes. It is missing lots of features at the moment but is useful as it stands. Unlike ncdu it does not show excluded files.</p>
<p>Note that it might take some time to delete big files/directories. The UI won't respond in the meantime since the deletion is done synchronously.</p>
<p>For a non-interactive listing of the remote, see the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_tree/">tree</a> command. To just get the total size of the remote you can also use the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_size/">size</a> command.</p>

<h1 id="rclone-nfsmount">rclone nfsmount</h1>
<p>Mount the remote as file system on a mountpoint.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-57">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Rclone nfsmount allows Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows to mount any of Rclone's cloud storage systems as a file system with FUSE.</p>
<p>First set up your remote using <code>rclone config</code>. Check it works with <code>rclone ls</code> etc.</p>
<p>On Linux and macOS, you can run mount in either foreground or background (aka daemon) mode. Mount runs in foreground mode by default. Use the <code>--daemon</code> flag to force background mode. On Windows you can run mount in foreground only, the flag is ignored.</p>
<p>In background mode rclone acts as a generic Unix mount program: the main program starts, spawns background rclone process to setup and maintain the mount, waits until success or timeout and exits with appropriate code (killing the child process if it fails).</p>
<p>On Linux/macOS/FreeBSD start the mount like this, where <code>/path/to/local/mount</code> is an <strong>empty</strong> <strong>existing</strong> directory:</p>
<pre><code>rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files /path/to/local/mount</code></pre>
<p>On Windows you can start a mount in different ways. See <a href="#mounting-modes-on-windows">below</a> for details. If foreground mount is used interactively from a console window, rclone will serve the mount and occupy the console so another window should be used to work with the mount until rclone is interrupted e.g. by pressing Ctrl-C.</p>
<p>The following examples will mount to an automatically assigned drive, to specific drive letter <code>X:</code>, to path <code>C:\path\parent\mount</code> (where parent directory or drive must exist, and mount must <strong>not</strong> exist, and is not supported when <a href="#mounting-modes-on-windows">mounting as a network drive</a>), and the last example will mount as network share <code>\\cloud\remote</code> and map it to an automatically assigned drive:</p>
<pre><code>rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files *
rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files X:
rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files C:\path\parent\mount
rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files \\cloud\remote</code></pre>
<p>When the program ends while in foreground mode, either via Ctrl+C or receiving a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, the mount should be automatically stopped.</p>
<p>When running in background mode the user will have to stop the mount manually:</p>
<pre><code># Linux
fusermount -u /path/to/local/mount
#... or on some systems
fusermount3 -u /path/to/local/mount
# OS X or Linux when using nfsmount
umount /path/to/local/mount</code></pre>
<p>The umount operation can fail, for example when the mountpoint is busy. When that happens, it is the user's responsibility to stop the mount manually.</p>
<p>The size of the mounted file system will be set according to information retrieved from the remote, the same as returned by the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/">rclone about</a> command. Remotes with unlimited storage may report the used size only, then an additional 1 PiB of free space is assumed. If the remote does not <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">support</a> the about feature at all, then 1 PiB is set as both the total and the free size.</p>
<h2 id="installing-on-windows-1">Installing on Windows</h2>
<p>To run rclone nfsmount on Windows, you will need to download and install <a href="http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/">WinFsp</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp">WinFsp</a> is an open-source Windows File System Proxy which makes it easy to write user space file systems for Windows. It provides a FUSE emulation layer which rclone uses combination with <a href="https://github.com/winfsp/cgofuse">cgofuse</a>. Both of these packages are by Bill Zissimopoulos who was very helpful during the implementation of rclone nfsmount for Windows.</p>
<h3 id="mounting-modes-on-windows-1">Mounting modes on windows</h3>
<p>Unlike other operating systems, Microsoft Windows provides a different filesystem type for network and fixed drives. It optimises access on the assumption fixed disk drives are fast and reliable, while network drives have relatively high latency and less reliability. Some settings can also be differentiated between the two types, for example that Windows Explorer should just display icons and not create preview thumbnails for image and video files on network drives.</p>
<p>In most cases, rclone will mount the remote as a normal, fixed disk drive by default. However, you can also choose to mount it as a remote network drive, often described as a network share. If you mount an rclone remote using the default, fixed drive mode and experience unexpected program errors, freezes or other issues, consider mounting as a network drive instead.</p>
<p>When mounting as a fixed disk drive you can either mount to an unused drive letter, or to a path representing a <strong>nonexistent</strong> subdirectory of an <strong>existing</strong> parent directory or drive. Using the special value <code>*</code> will tell rclone to automatically assign the next available drive letter, starting with Z: and moving backward. Examples:</p>
<pre><code>rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files *
rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files X:
rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files C:\path\parent\mount
rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files X:</code></pre>
<p>Option <code>--volname</code> can be used to set a custom volume name for the mounted file system. The default is to use the remote name and path.</p>
<p>To mount as network drive, you can add option <code>--network-mode</code> to your nfsmount command. Mounting to a directory path is not supported in this mode, it is a limitation Windows imposes on junctions, so the remote must always be mounted to a drive letter.</p>
<pre><code>rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files X: --network-mode</code></pre>
<p>A volume name specified with <code>--volname</code> will be used to create the network share path. A complete UNC path, such as <code>\\cloud\remote</code>, optionally with path <code>\\cloud\remote\madeup\path</code>, will be used as is. Any other string will be used as the share part, after a default prefix <code>\\server\</code>. If no volume name is specified then <code>\\server\share</code> will be used. You must make sure the volume name is unique when you are mounting more than one drive, or else the mount command will fail. The share name will treated as the volume label for the mapped drive, shown in Windows Explorer etc, while the complete <code>\\server\share</code> will be reported as the remote UNC path by <code>net use</code> etc, just like a normal network drive mapping.</p>
<p>If you specify a full network share UNC path with <code>--volname</code>, this will implicitly set the <code>--network-mode</code> option, so the following two examples have same result:</p>
<pre><code>rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files X: --network-mode
rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files X: --volname \\server\share</code></pre>
<p>You may also specify the network share UNC path as the mountpoint itself. Then rclone will automatically assign a drive letter, same as with <code>*</code> and use that as mountpoint, and instead use the UNC path specified as the volume name, as if it were specified with the <code>--volname</code> option. This will also implicitly set the <code>--network-mode</code> option. This means the following two examples have same result:</p>
<pre><code>rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files \\cloud\remote
rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files * --volname \\cloud\remote</code></pre>
<p>There is yet another way to enable network mode, and to set the share path, and that is to pass the "native" libfuse/WinFsp option directly: <code>--fuse-flag --VolumePrefix=\server\share</code>. Note that the path must be with just a single backslash prefix in this case.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> In previous versions of rclone this was the only supported method.</p>

<h3 id="windows-filesystem-permissions-1">Windows filesystem permissions</h3>
<p>The FUSE emulation layer on Windows must convert between the POSIX-based permission model used in FUSE, and the permission model used in Windows, based on access-control lists (ACL).</p>
<p>The mounted filesystem will normally get three entries in its access-control list (ACL), representing permissions for the POSIX permission scopes: Owner, group and others. By default, the owner and group will be taken from the current user, and the built-in group "Everyone" will be used to represent others. The user/group can be customized with FUSE options "UserName" and "GroupName", e.g. <code>-o UserName=user123 -o GroupName="Authenticated Users"</code>. The permissions on each entry will be set according to <a href="#options">options</a> <code>--dir-perms</code> and <code>--file-perms</code>, which takes a value in traditional Unix <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions#Numeric_notation">numeric notation</a>.</p>
<p>The default permissions corresponds to <code>--file-perms 0666 --dir-perms 0777</code>, i.e. read and write permissions to everyone. This means you will not be able to start any programs from the mount. To be able to do that you must add execute permissions, e.g. <code>--file-perms 0777 --dir-perms 0777</code> to add it to everyone. If the program needs to write files, chances are you will have to enable <a href="#vfs-file-caching">VFS File Caching</a> as well (see also <a href="#limitations">limitations</a>). Note that the default write permission have some restrictions for accounts other than the owner, specifically it lacks the "write extended attributes", as explained next.</p>
<p>The mapping of permissions is not always trivial, and the result you see in Windows Explorer may not be exactly like you expected. For example, when setting a value that includes write access for the group or others scope, this will be mapped to individual permissions "write attributes", "write data" and "append data", but not "write extended attributes". Windows will then show this as basic permission "Special" instead of "Write", because "Write" also covers the "write extended attributes" permission. When setting digit 0 for group or others, to indicate no permissions, they will still get individual permissions "read attributes", "read extended attributes" and "read permissions". This is done for compatibility reasons, e.g. to allow users without additional permissions to be able to read basic metadata about files like in Unix.</p>
<p>WinFsp 2021 (version 1.9) introduced a new FUSE option "FileSecurity", that allows the complete specification of file security descriptors using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-string-format">SDDL</a>. With this you get detailed control of the resulting permissions, compared to use of the POSIX permissions described above, and no additional permissions will be added automatically for compatibility with Unix. Some example use cases will following.</p>
<p>If you set POSIX permissions for only allowing access to the owner, using <code>--file-perms 0600 --dir-perms 0700</code>, the user group and the built-in "Everyone" group will still be given some special permissions, as described above. Some programs may then (incorrectly) interpret this as the file being accessible by everyone, for example an SSH client may warn about "unprotected private key file". You can work around this by specifying <code>-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FA;;;OW)"</code>, which sets file all access (FA) to the owner (OW), and nothing else.</p>
<p>When setting write permissions then, except for the owner, this does not include the "write extended attributes" permission, as mentioned above. This may prevent applications from writing to files, giving permission denied error instead. To set working write permissions for the built-in "Everyone" group, similar to what it gets by default but with the addition of the "write extended attributes", you can specify <code>-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FRFW;;;WD)"</code>, which sets file read (FR) and file write (FW) to everyone (WD). If file execute (FX) is also needed, then change to <code>-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FRFWFX;;;WD)"</code>, or set file all access (FA) to get full access permissions, including delete, with <code>-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FA;;;WD)"</code>.</p>
<h3 id="windows-caveats-1">Windows caveats</h3>
<p>Drives created as Administrator are not visible to other accounts, not even an account that was elevated to Administrator with the User Account Control (UAC) feature. A result of this is that if you mount to a drive letter from a Command Prompt run as Administrator, and then try to access the same drive from Windows Explorer (which does not run as Administrator), you will not be able to see the mounted drive.</p>
<p>If you don't need to access the drive from applications running with administrative privileges, the easiest way around this is to always create the mount from a non-elevated command prompt.</p>
<p>To make mapped drives available to the user account that created them regardless if elevated or not, there is a special Windows setting called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/networking/mapped-drives-not-available-from-elevated-command#detail-to-configure-the-enablelinkedconnections-registry-entry">linked connections</a> that can be enabled.</p>
<p>It is also possible to make a drive mount available to everyone on the system, by running the process creating it as the built-in SYSTEM account. There are several ways to do this: One is to use the command-line utility <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec">PsExec</a>, from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite, which has option <code>-s</code> to start processes as the SYSTEM account. Another alternative is to run the mount command from a Windows Scheduled Task, or a Windows Service, configured to run as the SYSTEM account. A third alternative is to use the <a href="https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp/wiki/WinFsp-Service-Architecture">WinFsp.Launcher infrastructure</a>). Read more in the <a href="https://rclone.org/install/">install documentation</a>. Note that when running rclone as another user, it will not use the configuration file from your profile unless you tell it to with the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#config-config-file"><code>--config</code></a> option. Note also that it is now the SYSTEM account that will have the owner permissions, and other accounts will have permissions according to the group or others scopes. As mentioned above, these will then not get the "write extended attributes" permission, and this may prevent writing to files. You can work around this with the FileSecurity option, see example above.</p>
<p>Note that mapping to a directory path, instead of a drive letter, does not suffer from the same limitations.</p>
<h2 id="mounting-on-macos-1">Mounting on macOS</h2>
<p>Mounting on macOS can be done either via <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_nfs/">built-in NFS server</a>, <a href="https://osxfuse.github.io/">macFUSE</a> (also known as osxfuse) or <a href="https://www.fuse-t.org/">FUSE-T</a>. macFUSE is a traditional FUSE driver utilizing a macOS kernel extension (kext). FUSE-T is an alternative FUSE system which "mounts" via an NFSv4 local server.</p>
<h4 id="unicode-normalization-1">Unicode Normalization</h4>
<p>It is highly recommended to keep the default of <code>--no-unicode-normalization=false</code> for all <code>mount</code> and <code>serve</code> commands on macOS. For details, see <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#vfs-case-sensitivity">vfs-case-sensitivity</a>.</p>
<h3 id="nfs-mount-1">NFS mount</h3>
<p>This method spins up an NFS server using <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_nfs/">serve nfs</a> command and mounts it to the specified mountpoint. If you run this in background mode using |--daemon|, you will need to send SIGTERM signal to the rclone process using |kill| command to stop the mount.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--nfs-cache-handle-limit</code> controls the maximum number of cached file handles stored by the <code>nfsmount</code> caching handler. This should not be set too low or you may experience errors when trying to access files. The default is 1000000, but consider lowering this limit if the server's system resource usage causes problems.</p>
<h3 id="macfuse-notes-1">macFUSE Notes</h3>
<p>If installing macFUSE using <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/releases">dmg packages</a> from the website, rclone will locate the macFUSE libraries without any further intervention. If however, macFUSE is installed using the <a href="https://www.macports.org/">macports</a> package manager, the following addition steps are required.</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib
cd /usr/local/lib
sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/libfuse.2.dylib</code></pre>
<h3 id="fuse-t-limitations-caveats-and-notes-1">FUSE-T Limitations, Caveats, and Notes</h3>
<p>There are some limitations, caveats, and notes about how it works. These are current as of FUSE-T version 1.0.14.</p>
<h4 id="modtime-update-on-read-1">ModTime update on read</h4>
<p>As per the <a href="https://github.com/macos-fuse-t/fuse-t/wiki#caveats">FUSE-T wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>File access and modification times cannot be set separately as it seems to be an issue with the NFS client which always modifies both. Can be reproduced with 'touch -m' and 'touch -a' commands</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that viewing files with various tools, notably macOS Finder, will cause rlcone to update the modification time of the file. This may make rclone upload a full new copy of the file.</p>
<h4 id="read-only-mounts-1">Read Only mounts</h4>
<p>When mounting with <code>--read-only</code>, attempts to write to files will fail <em>silently</em> as opposed to with a clear warning as in macFUSE.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-1">Limitations</h2>
<p>Without the use of <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> this can only write files sequentially, it can only seek when reading. This means that many applications won't work with their files on an rclone mount without <code>--vfs-cache-mode writes</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-mode full</code>. See the <a href="#vfs-file-caching">VFS File Caching</a> section for more info. When using NFS mount on macOS, if you don't specify |--vfs-cache-mode| the mount point will be read-only.</p>
<p>The bucket-based remotes (e.g. Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2) do not support the concept of empty directories, so empty directories will have a tendency to disappear once they fall out of the directory cache.</p>
<p>When <code>rclone mount</code> is invoked on Unix with <code>--daemon</code> flag, the main rclone program will wait for the background mount to become ready or until the timeout specified by the <code>--daemon-wait</code> flag. On Linux it can check mount status using ProcFS so the flag in fact sets <strong>maximum</strong> time to wait, while the real wait can be less. On macOS / BSD the time to wait is constant and the check is performed only at the end. We advise you to set wait time on macOS reasonably.</p>
<p>Only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OS X and Windows at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="rclone-nfsmount-vs-rclone-synccopy">rclone nfsmount vs rclone sync/copy</h2>
<p>File systems expect things to be 100% reliable, whereas cloud storage systems are a long way from 100% reliable. The rclone sync/copy commands cope with this with lots of retries. However rclone nfsmount can't use retries in the same way without making local copies of the uploads. Look at the <a href="#vfs-file-caching">VFS File Caching</a> for solutions to make nfsmount more reliable.</p>
<h2 id="attribute-caching-1">Attribute caching</h2>
<p>You can use the flag <code>--attr-timeout</code> to set the time the kernel caches the attributes (size, modification time, etc.) for directory entries.</p>
<p>The default is <code>1s</code> which caches files just long enough to avoid too many callbacks to rclone from the kernel.</p>
<p>In theory 0s should be the correct value for filesystems which can change outside the control of the kernel. However this causes quite a few problems such as <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2157">rclone using too much memory</a>, <a href="https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-1-39-vs-1-40-mount-issue/5112">rclone not serving files to samba</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2095#issuecomment-371141147">excessive time listing directories</a>.</p>
<p>The kernel can cache the info about a file for the time given by <code>--attr-timeout</code>. You may see corruption if the remote file changes length during this window. It will show up as either a truncated file or a file with garbage on the end. With <code>--attr-timeout 1s</code> this is very unlikely but not impossible. The higher you set <code>--attr-timeout</code> the more likely it is. The default setting of "1s" is the lowest setting which mitigates the problems above.</p>
<p>If you set it higher (<code>10s</code> or <code>1m</code> say) then the kernel will call back to rclone less often making it more efficient, however there is more chance of the corruption issue above.</p>
<p>If files don't change on the remote outside of the control of rclone then there is no chance of corruption.</p>
<p>This is the same as setting the attr_timeout option in mount.fuse.</p>
<h2 id="filters-1">Filters</h2>
<p>Note that all the rclone filters can be used to select a subset of the files to be visible in the mount.</p>
<h2 id="systemd-1">systemd</h2>
<p>When running rclone nfsmount as a systemd service, it is possible to use Type=notify. In this case the service will enter the started state after the mountpoint has been successfully set up. Units having the rclone nfsmount service specified as a requirement will see all files and folders immediately in this mode.</p>
<p>Note that systemd runs mount units without any environment variables including <code>PATH</code> or <code>HOME</code>. This means that tilde (<code>~</code>) expansion will not work and you should provide <code>--config</code> and <code>--cache-dir</code> explicitly as absolute paths via rclone arguments. Since mounting requires the <code>fusermount</code> or <code>fusermount3</code> program, rclone will use the fallback PATH of <code>/bin:/usr/bin</code> in this scenario. Please ensure that <code>fusermount</code>/<code>fusermount3</code> is present on this PATH.</p>
<h2 id="rclone-as-unix-mount-helper-1">Rclone as Unix mount helper</h2>
<p>The core Unix program <code>/bin/mount</code> normally takes the <code>-t FSTYPE</code> argument then runs the <code>/sbin/mount.FSTYPE</code> helper program passing it mount options as <code>-o key=val,...</code> or <code>--opt=...</code>. Automount (classic or systemd) behaves in a similar way.</p>
<p>rclone by default expects GNU-style flags <code>--key val</code>. To run it as a mount helper you should symlink rclone binary to <code>/sbin/mount.rclone</code> and optionally <code>/usr/bin/rclonefs</code>, e.g. <code>ln -s /usr/bin/rclone /sbin/mount.rclone</code>. rclone will detect it and translate command-line arguments appropriately.</p>
<p>Now you can run classic mounts like this:</p>
<pre><code>mount sftp1:subdir /mnt/data -t rclone -o vfs_cache_mode=writes,sftp_key_file=/path/to/pem</code></pre>
<p>or create systemd mount units:</p>
<pre><code># /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.mount
[Unit]
Description=Mount for /mnt/data
[Mount]
Type=rclone
What=sftp1:subdir
Where=/mnt/data
Options=rw,_netdev,allow_other,args2env,vfs-cache-mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache-dir=/var/rclone</code></pre>
<p>optionally accompanied by systemd automount unit</p>
<pre><code># /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.automount
[Unit]
Description=AutoMount for /mnt/data
[Automount]
Where=/mnt/data
TimeoutIdleSec=600
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>
<p>or add in <code>/etc/fstab</code> a line like</p>
<pre><code>sftp1:subdir /mnt/data rclone rw,noauto,nofail,_netdev,x-systemd.automount,args2env,vfs_cache_mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache_dir=/var/cache/rclone 0 0</code></pre>
<p>or use classic Automountd. Remember to provide explicit <code>config=...,cache-dir=...</code> as a workaround for mount units being run without <code>HOME</code>.</p>
<p>Rclone in the mount helper mode will split <code>-o</code> argument(s) by comma, replace <code>_</code> by <code>-</code> and prepend <code>--</code> to get the command-line flags. Options containing commas or spaces can be wrapped in single or double quotes. Any inner quotes inside outer quotes of the same type should be doubled.</p>
<p>Mount option syntax includes a few extra options treated specially:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>env.NAME=VALUE</code> will set an environment variable for the mount process. This helps with Automountd and Systemd.mount which don't allow setting custom environment for mount helpers. Typically you will use <code>env.HTTPS_PROXY=proxy.host:3128</code> or <code>env.HOME=/root</code></li>
<li><code>command=cmount</code> can be used to run <code>cmount</code> or any other rclone command rather than the default <code>mount</code>.</li>
<li><code>args2env</code> will pass mount options to the mount helper running in background via environment variables instead of command line arguments. This allows to hide secrets from such commands as <code>ps</code> or <code>pgrep</code>.</li>
<li><code>vv...</code> will be transformed into appropriate <code>--verbose=N</code></li>
<li>standard mount options like <code>x-systemd.automount</code>, <code>_netdev</code>, <code>nosuid</code> and alike are intended only for Automountd and ignored by rclone.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vfs---virtual-file-system-1">VFS - Virtual File System</h2>
<p>This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing system.</p>
<p>Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various options explained below.</p>
<p>The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-directory-cache-1">VFS Directory Cache</h2>
<p>Using the <code>--dir-cache-time</code> flag, you can control how long a directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the cache.</p>
<pre><code>--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)</code></pre>
<p>However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the polling interval.</p>
<p>You can send a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to rclone for it to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:</p>
<pre><code>kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)</code></pre>
<p>If you configure rclone with a <a href="/rc">remote control</a> then you can use rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget</code></pre>
<p>Or individual files or directories:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir</code></pre>
<h2 id="vfs-file-buffering-1">VFS File Buffering</h2>
<p>The <code>--buffer-size</code> flag determines the amount of memory, that will be used to buffer data in advance.</p>
<p>Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be shared.</p>
<p>This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.</p>
<p>The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to <code>--buffer-size * open files</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-file-caching-1">VFS File Caching</h2>
<p>These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.</p>
<p>For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.</p>
<p>Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may find that you need one or the other or both.</p>
<pre><code>--cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)</code></pre>
<p>If run with <code>-vv</code> rclone will print the location of the file cache. The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but can be controlled with <code>--cache-dir</code> or setting the appropriate environment variable.</p>
<p>The cache has 4 different modes selected by <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code>. The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using disk space.</p>
<p>Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed and if they haven't been accessed for <code>--vfs-write-back</code> seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.</p>
<p>If using <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> note that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every <code>--vfs-cache-poll-interval</code>. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> is exceeded, rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant files are likely to remain cached.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-cache-max-age</code> will evict files from the cache after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of 1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0 and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .</p>
<p>You <strong>should not</strong> run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using <code>--vfs-cache-mode &gt; off</code>. This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with <code>--cache-dir</code>. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-off-1">--vfs-cache-mode off</h3>
<p>In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.</p>
<p>This will mean some operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files can't be opened for both read AND write</li>
<li>Files opened for write can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only</li>
<li>Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied</li>
<li>Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-minimal-1">--vfs-cache-mode minimal</h3>
<p>This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.</p>
<p>These operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files opened for write only can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-writes-1">--vfs-cache-mode writes</h3>
<p>In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations.</p>
<p>If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing intervals up to 1 minute.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-full-1">--vfs-cache-mode full</h3>
<p>In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.</p>
<p>In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.</p>
<p>So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present in them.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations and is otherwise identical to <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> writes.</p>
<p>When reading a file rclone will read <code>--buffer-size</code> plus <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> bytes ahead. The <code>--buffer-size</code> is buffered in memory whereas the <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is buffered on disk.</p>
<p>When using this mode it is recommended that <code>--buffer-size</code> is not set too large and <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is set large if required.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> not all file systems support sparse files. In particular FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message if one is detected.</p>
<h3 id="fingerprinting-1">Fingerprinting</h3>
<p>Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made from:</p>
<ul>
<li>size</li>
<li>modification time</li>
<li>hash</li>
</ul>
<p>where available on an object.</p>
<p>On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).</p>
<p>For example <code>hash</code> is slow with the <code>local</code> and <code>sftp</code> backends as they have to read the entire file and hash it, and <code>modtime</code> is slow with the <code>s3</code>, <code>swift</code>, <code>ftp</code> and <code>qinqstor</code> backends because they need to do an extra API call to fetch it.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-fast-fingerprint</code> flag then rclone will not include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the opening time of cached files.</p>
<p>If you are running a vfs cache over <code>local</code>, <code>s3</code> or <code>swift</code> backends then using this flag is recommended.</p>
<p>Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to be downloaded again.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-chunked-reading-1">VFS Chunked Reading</h2>
<p>When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.</p>
<p>These flags control the chunking:</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
--vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once</code></pre>
<p>The chunking behaves differently depending on the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> parameter.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-2"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> == 0</h3>
<p>Rclone will start reading a chunk of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, and then double the size for each read. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit</code> is specified, and greater than <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, the chunk size for each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.</p>
<p>With <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0</code> the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M</code> is specified, the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.</p>
<p>Setting <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> to <code>0</code> or "off" disables chunked reading.</p>
<p>The chunks will not be buffered in memory.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-3"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> &gt; 0</h3>
<p>Rclone reads <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> chunks of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> concurrently. The size for each read will stay constant.</p>
<p>This improves performance performance massively on high latency links or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.</p>
<p>Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> as these will depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.</p>
<p>For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to start might be <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M</code>. In testing with AWS S3 the performance scaled roughly as the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> setting.</p>
<p>Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on the latency they may need more <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> in order to get the throughput.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-performance-1">VFS Performance</h2>
<p>These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for performance or other reasons. See also the <a href="#vfs-chunked-reading">chunked reading</a> feature.</p>
<p>In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the <code>--no-modtime</code> flag (or use <code>--use-server-modtime</code> for a slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a transaction.</p>
<pre><code>--no-checksum     Don&#39;t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don&#39;t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don&#39;t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)</code></pre>
<p>When using VFS write caching (<code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> with value writes or full), the global flag <code>--transfers</code> can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache (the related global flag <code>--checkers</code> has no effect on the VFS).</p>
<pre><code>--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)</code></pre>
<h2 id="symlinks-1">Symlinks</h2>
<p>By default the VFS does not support symlinks. However this may be enabled with either of the following flags:</p>
<pre><code>--links      Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension.
--vfs-links  Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension for the VFS</code></pre>
<p>As most cloud storage systems do not support symlinks directly, rclone stores the symlink as a normal file with a special extension. So a file which appears as a symlink <code>link-to-file.txt</code> would be stored on cloud storage as <code>link-to-file.txt.rclonelink</code> and the contents would be the path to the symlink destination.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--links</code> enables symlink translation globally in rclone - this includes any backend which supports the concept (for example the local backend). <code>--vfs-links</code> just enables it for the VFS layer.</p>
<p>This scheme is compatible with that used by the <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#symlinks-junction-points">local backend with the --local-links flag</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-links</code> flag has been designed for <code>rclone mount</code>, <code>rclone nfsmount</code> and <code>rclone serve nfs</code>.</p>
<p>It hasn't been tested with the other <code>rclone serve</code> commands yet.</p>
<p>A limitation of the current implementation is that it expects the caller to resolve sub-symlinks. For example given this directory tree</p>
<pre><code>.
├── dir
│   └── file.txt
└── linked-dir -&gt; dir</code></pre>
<p>The VFS will correctly resolve <code>linked-dir</code> but not <code>linked-dir/file.txt</code>. This is not a problem for the tested commands but may be for other commands.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that there is an outstanding issue with symlink support <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8245">issue #8245</a> with duplicate files being created when symlinks are moved into directories where there is a file of the same name (or vice versa).</p>
<h2 id="vfs-case-sensitivity-1">VFS Case Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.</p>
<p>File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.</p>
<p>Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-case-insensitive</code> VFS flag controls how rclone handles these two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.</p>
<p>The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by the underlying remote.</p>
<p>Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.</p>
<p>If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".</p>
<p>The <code>--no-unicode-normalization</code> flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is performed for filenames that differ but are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">canonically equivalent</a> with respect to unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS, which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is therefore highly recommended to keep the default of <code>false</code> on macOS, to avoid encoding compatibility issues.</p>
<p>In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the <code>--vfs-block-norm-dupes</code> flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount, and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. <code>--vfs-block- norm-dupes</code> prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in <code>rclone sync</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-disk-options-1">VFS Disk Options</h2>
<p>This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system. It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)</code></pre>
<h2 id="alternate-report-of-used-bytes-1">Alternate report of used bytes</h2>
<p>Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used. If you need this information to be available when running <code>df</code> on the filesystem, then pass the flag <code>--vfs-used-is-size</code> to rclone. With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to <code>rclone size</code> and compute the total used space itself.</p>
<p><em>WARNING.</em> Contrary to <code>rclone size</code>, this flag ignores filters so that the result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-metadata-1">VFS Metadata</h2>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-metadata-extension</code> flag you can get the VFS to expose files which contain the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata">metadata</a> as a JSON blob. These files will not appear in the directory listing, but can be <code>stat</code>-ed and opened and once they have been they <strong>will</strong> appear in directory listings until the directory cache expires.</p>
<p>Note that some backends won't create metadata unless you pass in the <code>--metadata</code> flag.</p>
<p>For example, using <code>rclone mount</code> with <code>--metadata --vfs-metadata-extension .metadata</code> we get</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l /mnt/
total 1048577
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1073741824 Mar  3 16:03 1G

<h1 id="rclone-obscure">rclone obscure</h1>
<p>Obscure password for use in the rclone config file.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-58">Synopsis</h2>
<p>In the rclone config file, human-readable passwords are obscured. Obscuring them is done by encrypting them and writing them out in base64. This is <strong>not</strong> a secure way of encrypting these passwords as rclone can decrypt them - it is to prevent "eyedropping" - namely someone seeing a password in the rclone config file by accident.</p>
<p>Many equally important things (like access tokens) are not obscured in the config file. However it is very hard to shoulder surf a 64 character hex token.</p>
<p>This command can also accept a password through STDIN instead of an argument by passing a hyphen as an argument. This will use the first line of STDIN as the password not including the trailing newline.</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;secretpassword&quot; | rclone obscure -</code></pre>
<p>If there is no data on STDIN to read, rclone obscure will default to obfuscating the hyphen itself.</p>
<p>If you want to encrypt the config file then please use config file encryption - see <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config/">rclone config</a> for more info.</p>

<h1 id="rclone-rc">rclone rc</h1>
<p>Run a command against a running rclone.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-59">Synopsis</h2>
<p>This runs a command against a running rclone. Use the <code>--url</code> flag to specify an non default URL to connect on. This can be either a ":port" which is taken to mean "http://localhost:port" or a "host:port" which is taken to mean "http://host:port"</p>
<p>A username and password can be passed in with <code>--user</code> and <code>--pass</code>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--rc-addr</code>, <code>--rc-user</code>, <code>--rc-pass</code> will be read also for <code>--url</code>, <code>--user</code>, <code>--pass</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>--unix-socket</code> flag can be used to connect over a unix socket like this</p>
<pre><code># start server on /tmp/my.socket
rclone rcd --rc-addr unix:///tmp/my.socket
# Connect to it
rclone rc --unix-socket /tmp/my.socket core/stats</code></pre>
<p>Arguments should be passed in as parameter=value.</p>
<p>The result will be returned as a JSON object by default.</p>
<p>The <code>--json</code> parameter can be used to pass in a JSON blob as an input instead of key=value arguments. This is the only way of passing in more complicated values.</p>
<p>The <code>-o</code>/<code>--opt</code> option can be used to set a key "opt" with key, value options in the form <code>-o key=value</code> or <code>-o key</code>. It can be repeated as many times as required. This is useful for rc commands which take the "opt" parameter which by convention is a dictionary of strings.</p>
<pre><code>-o key=value -o key2</code></pre>
<p>Will place this in the "opt" value</p>
<pre><code>{&quot;key&quot;:&quot;value&quot;, &quot;key2&quot;,&quot;&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-a</code>/<code>--arg</code> option can be used to set strings in the "arg" value. It can be repeated as many times as required. This is useful for rc commands which take the "arg" parameter which by convention is a list of strings.</p>
<pre><code>-a value -a value2</code></pre>
<p>Will place this in the "arg" value</p>
<pre><code>[&quot;value&quot;, &quot;value2&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>--loopback</code> to connect to the rclone instance running <code>rclone rc</code>. This is very useful for testing commands without having to run an rclone rc server, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc --loopback operations/about fs=/</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>rclone rc</code> to see a list of all possible commands.</p>

<h1 id="rclone-rcat">rclone rcat</h1>
<p>Copies standard input to file on remote.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-60">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Reads from standard input (stdin) and copies it to a single remote file.</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;hello world&quot; | rclone rcat remote:path/to/file
ffmpeg - | rclone rcat remote:path/to/file</code></pre>
<p>If the remote file already exists, it will be overwritten.</p>
<p>rcat will try to upload small files in a single request, which is usually more efficient than the streaming/chunked upload endpoints, which use multiple requests. Exact behaviour depends on the remote. What is considered a small file may be set through <code>--streaming-upload-cutoff</code>. Uploading only starts after the cutoff is reached or if the file ends before that. The data must fit into RAM. The cutoff needs to be small enough to adhere the limits of your remote, please see there. Generally speaking, setting this cutoff too high will decrease your performance.</p>
<p>Use the <code>--size</code> flag to preallocate the file in advance at the remote end and actually stream it, even if remote backend doesn't support streaming.</p>
<p><code>--size</code> should be the exact size of the input stream in bytes. If the size of the stream is different in length to the <code>--size</code> passed in then the transfer will likely fail.</p>
<p>Note that the upload cannot be retried because the data is not stored. If the backend supports multipart uploading then individual chunks can be retried. If you need to transfer a lot of data, you may be better off caching it locally and then <code>rclone move</code> it to the destination which can use retries.</p>

<h1 id="rclone-rcd">rclone rcd</h1>
<p>Run rclone listening to remote control commands only.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-61">Synopsis</h2>
<p>This runs rclone so that it only listens to remote control commands.</p>
<p>This is useful if you are controlling rclone via the rc API.</p>
<p>If you pass in a path to a directory, rclone will serve that directory for GET requests on the URL passed in. It will also open the URL in the browser when rclone is run.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/rc/">rc documentation</a> for more info on the rc flags.</p>
<h2 id="server-options">Server options</h2>
<p>Use <code>--rc-addr</code> to specify which IP address and port the server should listen on, eg <code>--rc-addr 1.2.3.4:8000</code> or <code>--rc-addr :8080</code> to listen to all IPs. By default it only listens on localhost. You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.</p>
<p>If you set <code>--rc-addr</code> to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.</p>
<p>You can use a unix socket by setting the url to <code>unix:///path/to/socket</code> or just by using an absolute path name.</p>
<p><code>--rc-addr</code> may be repeated to listen on multiple IPs/ports/sockets. Socket activation, described further below, can also be used to accomplish the same.</p>
<p><code>--rc-server-read-timeout</code> and <code>--rc-server-write-timeout</code> can be used to control the timeouts on the server. Note that this is the total time for a transfer.</p>
<p><code>--rc-max-header-bytes</code> controls the maximum number of bytes the server will accept in the HTTP header.</p>
<p><code>--rc-baseurl</code> controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from. By default rclone will serve from the root. If you used <code>--rc-baseurl "/rclone"</code> then rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/". This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve. Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing "/" on <code>--rc-baseurl</code>, so <code>--rc-baseurl "rclone"</code>, <code>--rc-baseurl "/rclone"</code> and <code>--rc-baseurl "/rclone/"</code> are all treated identically.</p>
<h3 id="tls-ssl">TLS (SSL)</h3>
<p>By default this will serve over http. If you want you can serve over https. You will need to supply the <code>--rc-cert</code> and <code>--rc-key</code> flags. If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need to supply <code>--rc-client-ca</code> also.</p>
<p><code>--rc-cert</code> must be set to the path of a file containing either a PEM encoded certificate, or a concatenation of that with the CA certificate. <code>--rc-key</code> must be set to the path of a file with the PEM encoded private key. If setting <code>--rc-client-ca</code>, it should be set to the path of a file with PEM encoded client certificate authority certificates.</p>
<p><code>--rc-min-tls-version</code> is minimum TLS version that is acceptable. Valid values are "tls1.0", "tls1.1", "tls1.2" and "tls1.3" (default "tls1.0").</p>
<h2 id="socket-activation">Socket activation</h2>
<p>Instead of the listening addresses specified above, rclone will listen to all FDs passed by the service manager, if any (and ignore any arguments passed by <code>--rc-addr</code>).</p>
<p>This allows rclone to be a socket-activated service. It can be configured with .socket and .service unit files as described in https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html</p>
<p>Socket activation can be tested ad-hoc with the <code>systemd-socket-activate</code>command</p>
<pre><code>   systemd-socket-activate -l 8000 -- rclone serve</code></pre>
<p>This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 8000 over TCP. ### Template</p>
<p><code>--rc-template</code> allows a user to specify a custom markup template for HTTP and WebDAV serve functions. The server exports the following markup to be used within the template to server pages:</p>

<h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
<p>By default this will serve files without needing a login.</p>
<p>You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set a single username and password with the <code>--rc-user</code> and <code>--rc-pass</code> flags.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can have the reverse proxy manage authentication and use the username provided in the configured header with <code>--user-from-header</code> (e.g., <code>--rc---user-from-header=x-remote-user</code>). Ensure the proxy is trusted and headers cannot be spoofed, as misconfiguration may lead to unauthorized access.</p>
<p>If either of the above authentication methods is not configured and client certificates are required by the <code>--client-ca</code> flag passed to the server, the client certificate common name will be considered as the username.</p>
<p>Use <code>--rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd</code> to provide an htpasswd file. This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic authentication. Bcrypt is recommended.</p>
<p>To create an htpasswd file:</p>
<pre><code>touch htpasswd
htpasswd -B htpasswd user
htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser</code></pre>
<p>The password file can be updated while rclone is running.</p>
<p>Use <code>--rc-realm</code> to set the authentication realm.</p>
<p>Use <code>--rc-salt</code> to change the password hashing salt from the default.</p>

<h1 id="rclone-rmdirs">rclone rmdirs</h1>
<p>Remove empty directories under the path.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-62">Synopsis</h2>
<p>This recursively removes any empty directories (including directories that only contain empty directories), that it finds under the path. The root path itself will also be removed if it is empty, unless you supply the <code>--leave-root</code> flag.</p>
<p>Use command <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rmdir/">rmdir</a> to delete just the empty directory given by path, not recurse.</p>
<p>This is useful for tidying up remotes that rclone has left a lot of empty directories in. For example the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_delete/">delete</a> command will delete files but leave the directory structure (unless used with option <code>--rmdirs</code>).</p>

<h1 id="rclone-selfupdate">rclone selfupdate</h1>
<p>Update the rclone binary.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-63">Synopsis</h2>
<p>This command downloads the latest release of rclone and replaces the currently running binary. The download is verified with a hashsum and cryptographically signed signature; see <a href="https://rclone.org/release_signing/">the release signing docs</a> for details.</p>
<p>If used without flags (or with implied <code>--stable</code> flag), this command will install the latest stable release. However, some issues may be fixed (or features added) only in the latest beta release. In such cases you should run the command with the <code>--beta</code> flag, i.e. <code>rclone selfupdate --beta</code>. You can check in advance what version would be installed by adding the <code>--check</code> flag, then repeat the command without it when you are satisfied.</p>
<p>Sometimes the rclone team may recommend you a concrete beta or stable rclone release to troubleshoot your issue or add a bleeding edge feature. The <code>--version VER</code> flag, if given, will update to the concrete version instead of the latest one. If you omit micro version from <code>VER</code> (for example <code>1.53</code>), the latest matching micro version will be used.</p>
<p>Upon successful update rclone will print a message that contains a previous version number. You will need it if you later decide to revert your update for some reason. Then you'll have to note the previous version and run the following command: <code>rclone selfupdate [--beta] OLDVER</code>. If the old version contains only dots and digits (for example <code>v1.54.0</code>) then it's a stable release so you won't need the <code>--beta</code> flag. Beta releases have an additional information similar to <code>v1.54.0-beta.5111.06f1c0c61</code>. (if you are a developer and use a locally built rclone, the version number will end with <code>-DEV</code>, you will have to rebuild it as it obviously can't be distributed).</p>
<p>If you previously installed rclone via a package manager, the package may include local documentation or configure services. You may wish to update with the flag <code>--package deb</code> or <code>--package rpm</code> (whichever is correct for your OS) to update these too. This command with the default <code>--package zip</code> will update only the rclone executable so the local manual may become inaccurate after it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/">rclone mount</a> command may or may not support extended FUSE options depending on the build and OS. <code>selfupdate</code> will refuse to update if the capability would be discarded.</p>
<p>Note: Windows forbids deletion of a currently running executable so this command will rename the old executable to 'rclone.old.exe' upon success.</p>
<p>Please note that this command was not available before rclone version 1.55. If it fails for you with the message <code>unknown command "selfupdate"</code> then you will need to update manually following the install instructions located at https://rclone.org/install/</p>

<h1 id="rclone-serve-dlna">rclone serve dlna</h1>
<p>Serve remote:path over DLNA</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-65">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Run a DLNA media server for media stored in an rclone remote. Many devices, such as the Xbox and PlayStation, can automatically discover this server in the LAN and play audio/video from it. VLC is also supported. Service discovery uses UDP multicast packets (SSDP) and will thus only work on LANs.</p>
<p>Rclone will list all files present in the remote, without filtering based on media formats or file extensions. Additionally, there is no media transcoding support. This means that some players might show files that they are not able to play back correctly.</p>
<p>Rclone will add external subtitle files (.srt) to videos if they have the same filename as the video file itself (except the extension), either in the same directory as the video, or in a "Subs" subdirectory.</p>
<h2 id="server-options-1">Server options</h2>
<p>Use <code>--addr</code> to specify which IP address and port the server should listen on, e.g. <code>--addr 1.2.3.4:8000</code> or <code>--addr :8080</code> to listen to all IPs.</p>
<p>Use <code>--name</code> to choose the friendly server name, which is by default "rclone (hostname)".</p>
<p>Use <code>--log-trace</code> in conjunction with <code>-vv</code> to enable additional debug logging of all UPNP traffic.</p>
<h2 id="vfs---virtual-file-system-2">VFS - Virtual File System</h2>
<p>This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing system.</p>
<p>Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various options explained below.</p>
<p>The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-directory-cache-2">VFS Directory Cache</h2>
<p>Using the <code>--dir-cache-time</code> flag, you can control how long a directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the cache.</p>
<pre><code>--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)</code></pre>
<p>However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the polling interval.</p>
<p>You can send a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to rclone for it to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:</p>
<pre><code>kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)</code></pre>
<p>If you configure rclone with a <a href="/rc">remote control</a> then you can use rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget</code></pre>
<p>Or individual files or directories:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir</code></pre>
<h2 id="vfs-file-buffering-2">VFS File Buffering</h2>
<p>The <code>--buffer-size</code> flag determines the amount of memory, that will be used to buffer data in advance.</p>
<p>Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be shared.</p>
<p>This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.</p>
<p>The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to <code>--buffer-size * open files</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-file-caching-2">VFS File Caching</h2>
<p>These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.</p>
<p>For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.</p>
<p>Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may find that you need one or the other or both.</p>
<pre><code>--cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)</code></pre>
<p>If run with <code>-vv</code> rclone will print the location of the file cache. The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but can be controlled with <code>--cache-dir</code> or setting the appropriate environment variable.</p>
<p>The cache has 4 different modes selected by <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code>. The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using disk space.</p>
<p>Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed and if they haven't been accessed for <code>--vfs-write-back</code> seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.</p>
<p>If using <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> note that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every <code>--vfs-cache-poll-interval</code>. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> is exceeded, rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant files are likely to remain cached.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-cache-max-age</code> will evict files from the cache after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of 1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0 and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .</p>
<p>You <strong>should not</strong> run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using <code>--vfs-cache-mode &gt; off</code>. This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with <code>--cache-dir</code>. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-off-2">--vfs-cache-mode off</h3>
<p>In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.</p>
<p>This will mean some operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files can't be opened for both read AND write</li>
<li>Files opened for write can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only</li>
<li>Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied</li>
<li>Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-minimal-2">--vfs-cache-mode minimal</h3>
<p>This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.</p>
<p>These operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files opened for write only can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-writes-2">--vfs-cache-mode writes</h3>
<p>In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations.</p>
<p>If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing intervals up to 1 minute.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-full-2">--vfs-cache-mode full</h3>
<p>In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.</p>
<p>In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.</p>
<p>So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present in them.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations and is otherwise identical to <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> writes.</p>
<p>When reading a file rclone will read <code>--buffer-size</code> plus <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> bytes ahead. The <code>--buffer-size</code> is buffered in memory whereas the <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is buffered on disk.</p>
<p>When using this mode it is recommended that <code>--buffer-size</code> is not set too large and <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is set large if required.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> not all file systems support sparse files. In particular FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message if one is detected.</p>
<h3 id="fingerprinting-2">Fingerprinting</h3>
<p>Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made from:</p>
<ul>
<li>size</li>
<li>modification time</li>
<li>hash</li>
</ul>
<p>where available on an object.</p>
<p>On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).</p>
<p>For example <code>hash</code> is slow with the <code>local</code> and <code>sftp</code> backends as they have to read the entire file and hash it, and <code>modtime</code> is slow with the <code>s3</code>, <code>swift</code>, <code>ftp</code> and <code>qinqstor</code> backends because they need to do an extra API call to fetch it.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-fast-fingerprint</code> flag then rclone will not include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the opening time of cached files.</p>
<p>If you are running a vfs cache over <code>local</code>, <code>s3</code> or <code>swift</code> backends then using this flag is recommended.</p>
<p>Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to be downloaded again.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-chunked-reading-2">VFS Chunked Reading</h2>
<p>When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.</p>
<p>These flags control the chunking:</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
--vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once</code></pre>
<p>The chunking behaves differently depending on the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> parameter.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-4"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> == 0</h3>
<p>Rclone will start reading a chunk of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, and then double the size for each read. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit</code> is specified, and greater than <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, the chunk size for each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.</p>
<p>With <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0</code> the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M</code> is specified, the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.</p>
<p>Setting <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> to <code>0</code> or "off" disables chunked reading.</p>
<p>The chunks will not be buffered in memory.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-5"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> &gt; 0</h3>
<p>Rclone reads <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> chunks of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> concurrently. The size for each read will stay constant.</p>
<p>This improves performance performance massively on high latency links or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.</p>
<p>Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> as these will depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.</p>
<p>For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to start might be <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M</code>. In testing with AWS S3 the performance scaled roughly as the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> setting.</p>
<p>Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on the latency they may need more <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> in order to get the throughput.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-performance-2">VFS Performance</h2>
<p>These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for performance or other reasons. See also the <a href="#vfs-chunked-reading">chunked reading</a> feature.</p>
<p>In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the <code>--no-modtime</code> flag (or use <code>--use-server-modtime</code> for a slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a transaction.</p>
<pre><code>--no-checksum     Don&#39;t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don&#39;t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don&#39;t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)</code></pre>
<p>When using VFS write caching (<code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> with value writes or full), the global flag <code>--transfers</code> can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache (the related global flag <code>--checkers</code> has no effect on the VFS).</p>
<pre><code>--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)</code></pre>
<h2 id="symlinks-2">Symlinks</h2>
<p>By default the VFS does not support symlinks. However this may be enabled with either of the following flags:</p>
<pre><code>--links      Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension.
--vfs-links  Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension for the VFS</code></pre>
<p>As most cloud storage systems do not support symlinks directly, rclone stores the symlink as a normal file with a special extension. So a file which appears as a symlink <code>link-to-file.txt</code> would be stored on cloud storage as <code>link-to-file.txt.rclonelink</code> and the contents would be the path to the symlink destination.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--links</code> enables symlink translation globally in rclone - this includes any backend which supports the concept (for example the local backend). <code>--vfs-links</code> just enables it for the VFS layer.</p>
<p>This scheme is compatible with that used by the <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#symlinks-junction-points">local backend with the --local-links flag</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-links</code> flag has been designed for <code>rclone mount</code>, <code>rclone nfsmount</code> and <code>rclone serve nfs</code>.</p>
<p>It hasn't been tested with the other <code>rclone serve</code> commands yet.</p>
<p>A limitation of the current implementation is that it expects the caller to resolve sub-symlinks. For example given this directory tree</p>
<pre><code>.
├── dir
│   └── file.txt
└── linked-dir -&gt; dir</code></pre>
<p>The VFS will correctly resolve <code>linked-dir</code> but not <code>linked-dir/file.txt</code>. This is not a problem for the tested commands but may be for other commands.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that there is an outstanding issue with symlink support <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8245">issue #8245</a> with duplicate files being created when symlinks are moved into directories where there is a file of the same name (or vice versa).</p>
<h2 id="vfs-case-sensitivity-2">VFS Case Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.</p>
<p>File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.</p>
<p>Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-case-insensitive</code> VFS flag controls how rclone handles these two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.</p>
<p>The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by the underlying remote.</p>
<p>Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.</p>
<p>If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".</p>
<p>The <code>--no-unicode-normalization</code> flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is performed for filenames that differ but are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">canonically equivalent</a> with respect to unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS, which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is therefore highly recommended to keep the default of <code>false</code> on macOS, to avoid encoding compatibility issues.</p>
<p>In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the <code>--vfs-block-norm-dupes</code> flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount, and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. <code>--vfs-block- norm-dupes</code> prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in <code>rclone sync</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-disk-options-2">VFS Disk Options</h2>
<p>This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system. It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)</code></pre>
<h2 id="alternate-report-of-used-bytes-2">Alternate report of used bytes</h2>
<p>Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used. If you need this information to be available when running <code>df</code> on the filesystem, then pass the flag <code>--vfs-used-is-size</code> to rclone. With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to <code>rclone size</code> and compute the total used space itself.</p>
<p><em>WARNING.</em> Contrary to <code>rclone size</code>, this flag ignores filters so that the result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-metadata-2">VFS Metadata</h2>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-metadata-extension</code> flag you can get the VFS to expose files which contain the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata">metadata</a> as a JSON blob. These files will not appear in the directory listing, but can be <code>stat</code>-ed and opened and once they have been they <strong>will</strong> appear in directory listings until the directory cache expires.</p>
<p>Note that some backends won't create metadata unless you pass in the <code>--metadata</code> flag.</p>
<p>For example, using <code>rclone mount</code> with <code>--metadata --vfs-metadata-extension .metadata</code> we get</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l /mnt/

</ul>
<h1 id="rclone-serve-docker">rclone serve docker</h1>
<p>Serve any remote on docker's volume plugin API.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-66">Synopsis</h2>
<p>This command implements the Docker volume plugin API allowing docker to use rclone as a data storage mechanism for various cloud providers. rclone provides <a href="/docker">docker volume plugin</a> based on it.</p>
<p>To create a docker plugin, one must create a Unix or TCP socket that Docker will look for when you use the plugin and then it listens for commands from docker daemon and runs the corresponding code when necessary. Docker plugins can run as a managed plugin under control of the docker daemon or as an independent native service. For testing, you can just run it directly from the command line, for example:</p>
<pre><code>sudo rclone serve docker --base-dir /tmp/rclone-volumes --socket-addr localhost:8787 -vv</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>rclone serve docker</code> will create the said socket, listening for commands from Docker to create the necessary Volumes. Normally you need not give the <code>--socket-addr</code> flag. The API will listen on the unix domain socket at <code>/run/docker/plugins/rclone.sock</code>. In the example above rclone will create a TCP socket and a small file <code>/etc/docker/plugins/rclone.spec</code> containing the socket address. We use <code>sudo</code> because both paths are writeable only by the root user.</p>
<p>If you later decide to change listening socket, the docker daemon must be restarted to reconnect to <code>/run/docker/plugins/rclone.sock</code> or parse new <code>/etc/docker/plugins/rclone.spec</code>. Until you restart, any volume related docker commands will timeout trying to access the old socket. Running directly is supported on <strong>Linux only</strong>, not on Windows or MacOS. This is not a problem with managed plugin mode described in details in the <a href="https://rclone.org/docker">full documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The command will create volume mounts under the path given by <code>--base-dir</code> (by default <code>/var/lib/docker-volumes/rclone</code> available only to root) and maintain the JSON formatted file <code>docker-plugin.state</code> in the rclone cache directory with book-keeping records of created and mounted volumes.</p>
<p>All mount and VFS options are submitted by the docker daemon via API, but you can also provide defaults on the command line as well as set path to the config file and cache directory or adjust logging verbosity.</p>
<h2 id="vfs---virtual-file-system-3">VFS - Virtual File System</h2>
<p>This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing system.</p>
<p>Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various options explained below.</p>
<p>The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-directory-cache-3">VFS Directory Cache</h2>
<p>Using the <code>--dir-cache-time</code> flag, you can control how long a directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the cache.</p>
<pre><code>--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)</code></pre>
<p>However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the polling interval.</p>
<p>You can send a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to rclone for it to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:</p>
<pre><code>kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)</code></pre>
<p>If you configure rclone with a <a href="/rc">remote control</a> then you can use rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget</code></pre>
<p>Or individual files or directories:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir</code></pre>
<h2 id="vfs-file-buffering-3">VFS File Buffering</h2>
<p>The <code>--buffer-size</code> flag determines the amount of memory, that will be used to buffer data in advance.</p>
<p>Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be shared.</p>
<p>This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.</p>
<p>The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to <code>--buffer-size * open files</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-file-caching-3">VFS File Caching</h2>
<p>These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.</p>
<p>For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.</p>
<p>Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may find that you need one or the other or both.</p>
<pre><code>--cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)</code></pre>
<p>If run with <code>-vv</code> rclone will print the location of the file cache. The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but can be controlled with <code>--cache-dir</code> or setting the appropriate environment variable.</p>
<p>The cache has 4 different modes selected by <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code>. The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using disk space.</p>
<p>Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed and if they haven't been accessed for <code>--vfs-write-back</code> seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.</p>
<p>If using <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> note that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every <code>--vfs-cache-poll-interval</code>. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> is exceeded, rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant files are likely to remain cached.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-cache-max-age</code> will evict files from the cache after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of 1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0 and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .</p>
<p>You <strong>should not</strong> run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using <code>--vfs-cache-mode &gt; off</code>. This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with <code>--cache-dir</code>. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-off-3">--vfs-cache-mode off</h3>
<p>In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.</p>
<p>This will mean some operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files can't be opened for both read AND write</li>
<li>Files opened for write can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only</li>
<li>Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied</li>
<li>Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-minimal-3">--vfs-cache-mode minimal</h3>
<p>This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.</p>
<p>These operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files opened for write only can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-writes-3">--vfs-cache-mode writes</h3>
<p>In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations.</p>
<p>If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing intervals up to 1 minute.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-full-3">--vfs-cache-mode full</h3>
<p>In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.</p>
<p>In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.</p>
<p>So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present in them.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations and is otherwise identical to <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> writes.</p>
<p>When reading a file rclone will read <code>--buffer-size</code> plus <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> bytes ahead. The <code>--buffer-size</code> is buffered in memory whereas the <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is buffered on disk.</p>
<p>When using this mode it is recommended that <code>--buffer-size</code> is not set too large and <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is set large if required.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> not all file systems support sparse files. In particular FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message if one is detected.</p>
<h3 id="fingerprinting-3">Fingerprinting</h3>
<p>Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made from:</p>
<ul>
<li>size</li>
<li>modification time</li>
<li>hash</li>
</ul>
<p>where available on an object.</p>
<p>On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).</p>
<p>For example <code>hash</code> is slow with the <code>local</code> and <code>sftp</code> backends as they have to read the entire file and hash it, and <code>modtime</code> is slow with the <code>s3</code>, <code>swift</code>, <code>ftp</code> and <code>qinqstor</code> backends because they need to do an extra API call to fetch it.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-fast-fingerprint</code> flag then rclone will not include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the opening time of cached files.</p>
<p>If you are running a vfs cache over <code>local</code>, <code>s3</code> or <code>swift</code> backends then using this flag is recommended.</p>
<p>Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to be downloaded again.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-chunked-reading-3">VFS Chunked Reading</h2>
<p>When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.</p>
<p>These flags control the chunking:</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
--vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once</code></pre>
<p>The chunking behaves differently depending on the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> parameter.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-6"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> == 0</h3>
<p>Rclone will start reading a chunk of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, and then double the size for each read. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit</code> is specified, and greater than <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, the chunk size for each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.</p>
<p>With <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0</code> the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M</code> is specified, the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.</p>
<p>Setting <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> to <code>0</code> or "off" disables chunked reading.</p>
<p>The chunks will not be buffered in memory.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-7"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> &gt; 0</h3>
<p>Rclone reads <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> chunks of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> concurrently. The size for each read will stay constant.</p>
<p>This improves performance performance massively on high latency links or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.</p>
<p>Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> as these will depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.</p>
<p>For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to start might be <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M</code>. In testing with AWS S3 the performance scaled roughly as the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> setting.</p>
<p>Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on the latency they may need more <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> in order to get the throughput.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-performance-3">VFS Performance</h2>
<p>These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for performance or other reasons. See also the <a href="#vfs-chunked-reading">chunked reading</a> feature.</p>
<p>In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the <code>--no-modtime</code> flag (or use <code>--use-server-modtime</code> for a slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a transaction.</p>
<pre><code>--no-checksum     Don&#39;t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don&#39;t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don&#39;t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)</code></pre>
<p>When using VFS write caching (<code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> with value writes or full), the global flag <code>--transfers</code> can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache (the related global flag <code>--checkers</code> has no effect on the VFS).</p>
<pre><code>--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)</code></pre>
<h2 id="symlinks-3">Symlinks</h2>
<p>By default the VFS does not support symlinks. However this may be enabled with either of the following flags:</p>
<pre><code>--links      Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension.
--vfs-links  Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension for the VFS</code></pre>
<p>As most cloud storage systems do not support symlinks directly, rclone stores the symlink as a normal file with a special extension. So a file which appears as a symlink <code>link-to-file.txt</code> would be stored on cloud storage as <code>link-to-file.txt.rclonelink</code> and the contents would be the path to the symlink destination.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--links</code> enables symlink translation globally in rclone - this includes any backend which supports the concept (for example the local backend). <code>--vfs-links</code> just enables it for the VFS layer.</p>
<p>This scheme is compatible with that used by the <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#symlinks-junction-points">local backend with the --local-links flag</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-links</code> flag has been designed for <code>rclone mount</code>, <code>rclone nfsmount</code> and <code>rclone serve nfs</code>.</p>
<p>It hasn't been tested with the other <code>rclone serve</code> commands yet.</p>
<p>A limitation of the current implementation is that it expects the caller to resolve sub-symlinks. For example given this directory tree</p>
<pre><code>.
├── dir
│   └── file.txt
└── linked-dir -&gt; dir</code></pre>
<p>The VFS will correctly resolve <code>linked-dir</code> but not <code>linked-dir/file.txt</code>. This is not a problem for the tested commands but may be for other commands.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that there is an outstanding issue with symlink support <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8245">issue #8245</a> with duplicate files being created when symlinks are moved into directories where there is a file of the same name (or vice versa).</p>
<h2 id="vfs-case-sensitivity-3">VFS Case Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.</p>
<p>File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.</p>
<p>Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-case-insensitive</code> VFS flag controls how rclone handles these two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.</p>
<p>The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by the underlying remote.</p>
<p>Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.</p>
<p>If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".</p>
<p>The <code>--no-unicode-normalization</code> flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is performed for filenames that differ but are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">canonically equivalent</a> with respect to unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS, which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is therefore highly recommended to keep the default of <code>false</code> on macOS, to avoid encoding compatibility issues.</p>
<p>In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the <code>--vfs-block-norm-dupes</code> flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount, and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. <code>--vfs-block- norm-dupes</code> prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in <code>rclone sync</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-disk-options-3">VFS Disk Options</h2>
<p>This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system. It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)</code></pre>
<h2 id="alternate-report-of-used-bytes-3">Alternate report of used bytes</h2>
<p>Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used. If you need this information to be available when running <code>df</code> on the filesystem, then pass the flag <code>--vfs-used-is-size</code> to rclone. With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to <code>rclone size</code> and compute the total used space itself.</p>
<p><em>WARNING.</em> Contrary to <code>rclone size</code>, this flag ignores filters so that the result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-metadata-3">VFS Metadata</h2>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-metadata-extension</code> flag you can get the VFS to expose files which contain the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata">metadata</a> as a JSON blob. These files will not appear in the directory listing, but can be <code>stat</code>-ed and opened and once they have been they <strong>will</strong> appear in directory listings until the directory cache expires.</p>
<p>Note that some backends won't create metadata unless you pass in the <code>--metadata</code> flag.</p>
<p>For example, using <code>rclone mount</code> with <code>--metadata --vfs-metadata-extension .metadata</code> we get</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l /mnt/
total 1048577
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1073741824 Mar  3 16:03 1G

<p>If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.</p>
<h3 id="authentication-1">Authentication</h3>
<p>By default this will serve files without needing a login.</p>
<p>You can set a single username and password with the --user and --pass flags.</p>
<h2 id="vfs---virtual-file-system-4">VFS - Virtual File System</h2>
<p>This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing system.</p>
<p>Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various options explained below.</p>
<p>The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-directory-cache-4">VFS Directory Cache</h2>
<p>Using the <code>--dir-cache-time</code> flag, you can control how long a directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the cache.</p>
<pre><code>--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)</code></pre>
<p>However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the polling interval.</p>
<p>You can send a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to rclone for it to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:</p>
<pre><code>kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)</code></pre>
<p>If you configure rclone with a <a href="/rc">remote control</a> then you can use rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget</code></pre>
<p>Or individual files or directories:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir</code></pre>
<h2 id="vfs-file-buffering-4">VFS File Buffering</h2>
<p>The <code>--buffer-size</code> flag determines the amount of memory, that will be used to buffer data in advance.</p>
<p>Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be shared.</p>
<p>This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.</p>
<p>The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to <code>--buffer-size * open files</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-file-caching-4">VFS File Caching</h2>
<p>These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.</p>
<p>For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.</p>
<p>Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may find that you need one or the other or both.</p>
<pre><code>--cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)</code></pre>
<p>If run with <code>-vv</code> rclone will print the location of the file cache. The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but can be controlled with <code>--cache-dir</code> or setting the appropriate environment variable.</p>
<p>The cache has 4 different modes selected by <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code>. The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using disk space.</p>
<p>Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed and if they haven't been accessed for <code>--vfs-write-back</code> seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.</p>
<p>If using <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> note that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every <code>--vfs-cache-poll-interval</code>. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> is exceeded, rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant files are likely to remain cached.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-cache-max-age</code> will evict files from the cache after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of 1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0 and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .</p>
<p>You <strong>should not</strong> run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using <code>--vfs-cache-mode &gt; off</code>. This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with <code>--cache-dir</code>. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-off-4">--vfs-cache-mode off</h3>
<p>In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.</p>
<p>This will mean some operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files can't be opened for both read AND write</li>
<li>Files opened for write can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only</li>
<li>Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied</li>
<li>Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-minimal-4">--vfs-cache-mode minimal</h3>
<p>This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.</p>
<p>These operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files opened for write only can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-writes-4">--vfs-cache-mode writes</h3>
<p>In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations.</p>
<p>If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing intervals up to 1 minute.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-full-4">--vfs-cache-mode full</h3>
<p>In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.</p>
<p>In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.</p>
<p>So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present in them.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations and is otherwise identical to <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> writes.</p>
<p>When reading a file rclone will read <code>--buffer-size</code> plus <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> bytes ahead. The <code>--buffer-size</code> is buffered in memory whereas the <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is buffered on disk.</p>
<p>When using this mode it is recommended that <code>--buffer-size</code> is not set too large and <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is set large if required.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> not all file systems support sparse files. In particular FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message if one is detected.</p>
<h3 id="fingerprinting-4">Fingerprinting</h3>
<p>Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made from:</p>
<ul>
<li>size</li>
<li>modification time</li>
<li>hash</li>
</ul>
<p>where available on an object.</p>
<p>On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).</p>
<p>For example <code>hash</code> is slow with the <code>local</code> and <code>sftp</code> backends as they have to read the entire file and hash it, and <code>modtime</code> is slow with the <code>s3</code>, <code>swift</code>, <code>ftp</code> and <code>qinqstor</code> backends because they need to do an extra API call to fetch it.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-fast-fingerprint</code> flag then rclone will not include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the opening time of cached files.</p>
<p>If you are running a vfs cache over <code>local</code>, <code>s3</code> or <code>swift</code> backends then using this flag is recommended.</p>
<p>Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to be downloaded again.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-chunked-reading-4">VFS Chunked Reading</h2>
<p>When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.</p>
<p>These flags control the chunking:</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
--vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once</code></pre>
<p>The chunking behaves differently depending on the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> parameter.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-8"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> == 0</h3>
<p>Rclone will start reading a chunk of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, and then double the size for each read. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit</code> is specified, and greater than <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, the chunk size for each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.</p>
<p>With <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0</code> the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M</code> is specified, the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.</p>
<p>Setting <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> to <code>0</code> or "off" disables chunked reading.</p>
<p>The chunks will not be buffered in memory.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-9"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> &gt; 0</h3>
<p>Rclone reads <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> chunks of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> concurrently. The size for each read will stay constant.</p>
<p>This improves performance performance massively on high latency links or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.</p>
<p>Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> as these will depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.</p>
<p>For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to start might be <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M</code>. In testing with AWS S3 the performance scaled roughly as the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> setting.</p>
<p>Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on the latency they may need more <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> in order to get the throughput.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-performance-4">VFS Performance</h2>
<p>These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for performance or other reasons. See also the <a href="#vfs-chunked-reading">chunked reading</a> feature.</p>
<p>In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the <code>--no-modtime</code> flag (or use <code>--use-server-modtime</code> for a slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a transaction.</p>
<pre><code>--no-checksum     Don&#39;t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don&#39;t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don&#39;t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)</code></pre>
<p>When using VFS write caching (<code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> with value writes or full), the global flag <code>--transfers</code> can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache (the related global flag <code>--checkers</code> has no effect on the VFS).</p>
<pre><code>--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)</code></pre>
<h2 id="symlinks-4">Symlinks</h2>
<p>By default the VFS does not support symlinks. However this may be enabled with either of the following flags:</p>
<pre><code>--links      Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension.
--vfs-links  Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension for the VFS</code></pre>
<p>As most cloud storage systems do not support symlinks directly, rclone stores the symlink as a normal file with a special extension. So a file which appears as a symlink <code>link-to-file.txt</code> would be stored on cloud storage as <code>link-to-file.txt.rclonelink</code> and the contents would be the path to the symlink destination.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--links</code> enables symlink translation globally in rclone - this includes any backend which supports the concept (for example the local backend). <code>--vfs-links</code> just enables it for the VFS layer.</p>
<p>This scheme is compatible with that used by the <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#symlinks-junction-points">local backend with the --local-links flag</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-links</code> flag has been designed for <code>rclone mount</code>, <code>rclone nfsmount</code> and <code>rclone serve nfs</code>.</p>
<p>It hasn't been tested with the other <code>rclone serve</code> commands yet.</p>
<p>A limitation of the current implementation is that it expects the caller to resolve sub-symlinks. For example given this directory tree</p>
<pre><code>.
├── dir
│   └── file.txt
└── linked-dir -&gt; dir</code></pre>
<p>The VFS will correctly resolve <code>linked-dir</code> but not <code>linked-dir/file.txt</code>. This is not a problem for the tested commands but may be for other commands.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that there is an outstanding issue with symlink support <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8245">issue #8245</a> with duplicate files being created when symlinks are moved into directories where there is a file of the same name (or vice versa).</p>
<h2 id="vfs-case-sensitivity-4">VFS Case Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.</p>
<p>File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.</p>
<p>Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-case-insensitive</code> VFS flag controls how rclone handles these two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.</p>
<p>The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by the underlying remote.</p>
<p>Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.</p>
<p>If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".</p>
<p>The <code>--no-unicode-normalization</code> flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is performed for filenames that differ but are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">canonically equivalent</a> with respect to unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS, which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is therefore highly recommended to keep the default of <code>false</code> on macOS, to avoid encoding compatibility issues.</p>
<p>In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the <code>--vfs-block-norm-dupes</code> flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount, and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. <code>--vfs-block- norm-dupes</code> prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in <code>rclone sync</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-disk-options-4">VFS Disk Options</h2>
<p>This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system. It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)</code></pre>
<h2 id="alternate-report-of-used-bytes-4">Alternate report of used bytes</h2>
<p>Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used. If you need this information to be available when running <code>df</code> on the filesystem, then pass the flag <code>--vfs-used-is-size</code> to rclone. With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to <code>rclone size</code> and compute the total used space itself.</p>
<p><em>WARNING.</em> Contrary to <code>rclone size</code>, this flag ignores filters so that the result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-metadata-4">VFS Metadata</h2>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-metadata-extension</code> flag you can get the VFS to expose files which contain the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata">metadata</a> as a JSON blob. These files will not appear in the directory listing, but can be <code>stat</code>-ed and opened and once they have been they <strong>will</strong> appear in directory listings until the directory cache expires.</p>
<p>Note that some backends won't create metadata unless you pass in the <code>--metadata</code> flag.</p>
<p>For example, using <code>rclone mount</code> with <code>--metadata --vfs-metadata-extension .metadata</code> we get</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l /mnt/
total 1048577
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1073741824 Mar  3 16:03 1G

$ cat /mnt/1G.metadata
{
        &quot;atime&quot;: &quot;2025-03-04T17:34:22.317069787Z&quot;,
        &quot;btime&quot;: &quot;2025-03-03T16:03:37.708253808Z&quot;,
        &quot;gid&quot;: &quot;1000&quot;,
        &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;100664&quot;,
        &quot;mtime&quot;: &quot;2025-03-03T16:03:39.640238323Z&quot;,
        &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;1000&quot;
}

$ ls -l /mnt/
total 1048578
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1073741824 Mar  3 16:03 1G
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user        185 Mar  3 16:03 1G.metadata</code></pre>
<p>If the file has no metadata it will be returned as <code>{}</code> and if there is an error reading the metadata the error will be returned as <code>{"error":"error string"}</code>.</p>
<h2 id="auth-proxy">Auth Proxy</h2>
<p>If you supply the parameter <code>--auth-proxy /path/to/program</code> then rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which then are used to authenticate incoming requests. This uses a simple JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> <code>--auth-proxy</code> and <code>--authorized-keys</code> cannot be used together, if <code>--auth-proxy</code> is set the authorized keys option will be ignored.</p>
<p>There is an example program <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/bin/test_proxy.py">bin/test_proxy.py</a> in the rclone source code.</p>
<p>The program's job is to take a <code>user</code> and <code>pass</code> on the input and turn those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format. This config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but it won't use configuration from environment variables or command line options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete config.</p>
<p>This config generated must have this extra parameter - <code>_root</code> - root to use for the backend</p>
<p>And it may have this parameter - <code>_obscure</code> - comma separated strings for parameters to obscure</p>
<p>If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;user&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,
    &quot;pass&quot;: &quot;mypassword&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;user&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,
    &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>And as an example return this on STDOUT</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sftp&quot;,
    &quot;_root&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
    &quot;_obscure&quot;: &quot;pass&quot;,
    &quot;user&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,
    &quot;pass&quot;: &quot;mypassword&quot;,
    &quot;host&quot;: &quot;sftp.example.com&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the <code>user</code> and <code>pass</code>/<code>public_key</code> returned in the output to the host given. Note that since <code>_obscure</code> is set to <code>pass</code>, rclone will obscure the <code>pass</code> parameter before creating the backend (which is required for sftp backends).</p>
<p>The program can manipulate the supplied <code>user</code> in any way, for example to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the <code>user</code> be <code>user@example.com</code> and then set the <code>host</code> to <code>example.com</code> in the output and the user to <code>user</code>. For security you'd probably want to restrict the <code>host</code> to a limited list.</p>
<p>Note that an internal cache is keyed on <code>user</code> so only use that for configuration, don't use <code>pass</code> or <code>public_key</code>. This also means that if a user's password or public-key is changed the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it takes effect.</p>
<p>This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend that rclone supports.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="rclone-serve-http">rclone serve http</h1>
<p>Serve the remote over HTTP.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-68">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Run a basic web server to serve a remote over HTTP. This can be viewed in a web browser or you can make a remote of type http read from it.</p>
<p>You can use the filter flags (e.g. <code>--include</code>, <code>--exclude</code>) to control what is served.</p>
<p>The server will log errors. Use <code>-v</code> to see access logs.</p>
<p><code>--bwlimit</code> will be respected for file transfers. Use <code>--stats</code> to control the stats printing.</p>
<h2 id="server-options-3">Server options</h2>
<p>Use <code>--addr</code> to specify which IP address and port the server should listen on, eg <code>--addr 1.2.3.4:8000</code> or <code>--addr :8080</code> to listen to all IPs. By default it only listens on localhost. You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.</p>
<p>If you set <code>--addr</code> to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.</p>
<p>You can use a unix socket by setting the url to <code>unix:///path/to/socket</code> or just by using an absolute path name.</p>
<p><code>--addr</code> may be repeated to listen on multiple IPs/ports/sockets. Socket activation, described further below, can also be used to accomplish the same.</p>
<p><code>--server-read-timeout</code> and <code>--server-write-timeout</code> can be used to control the timeouts on the server. Note that this is the total time for a transfer.</p>
<p><code>--max-header-bytes</code> controls the maximum number of bytes the server will accept in the HTTP header.</p>
<p><code>--baseurl</code> controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from. By default rclone will serve from the root. If you used <code>--baseurl "/rclone"</code> then rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/". This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve. Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing "/" on <code>--baseurl</code>, so <code>--baseurl "rclone"</code>, <code>--baseurl "/rclone"</code> and <code>--baseurl "/rclone/"</code> are all treated identically.</p>
<h3 id="tls-ssl-1">TLS (SSL)</h3>
<p>By default this will serve over http. If you want you can serve over https. You will need to supply the <code>--cert</code> and <code>--key</code> flags. If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need to supply <code>--client-ca</code> also.</p>
<p><code>--cert</code> must be set to the path of a file containing either a PEM encoded certificate, or a concatenation of that with the CA certificate. <code>--key</code> must be set to the path of a file with the PEM encoded private key. If setting <code>--client-ca</code>, it should be set to the path of a file with PEM encoded client certificate authority certificates.</p>
<p><code>--min-tls-version</code> is minimum TLS version that is acceptable. Valid values are "tls1.0", "tls1.1", "tls1.2" and "tls1.3" (default "tls1.0").</p>
<h2 id="socket-activation-1">Socket activation</h2>
<p>Instead of the listening addresses specified above, rclone will listen to all FDs passed by the service manager, if any (and ignore any arguments passed by <code>--addr</code>).</p>
<p>This allows rclone to be a socket-activated service. It can be configured with .socket and .service unit files as described in https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html</p>
<p>Socket activation can be tested ad-hoc with the <code>systemd-socket-activate</code>command</p>
<pre><code>   systemd-socket-activate -l 8000 -- rclone serve</code></pre>
<p>This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 8000 over TCP. ### Template</p>
<p><code>--template</code> allows a user to specify a custom markup template for HTTP and WebDAV serve functions. The server exports the following markup to be used within the template to server pages:</p>

<h3 id="authentication-2">Authentication</h3>
<p>By default this will serve files without needing a login.</p>
<p>You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set a single username and password with the <code>--user</code> and <code>--pass</code> flags.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can have the reverse proxy manage authentication and use the username provided in the configured header with <code>--user-from-header</code> (e.g., <code>----user-from-header=x-remote-user</code>). Ensure the proxy is trusted and headers cannot be spoofed, as misconfiguration may lead to unauthorized access.</p>
<p>If either of the above authentication methods is not configured and client certificates are required by the <code>--client-ca</code> flag passed to the server, the client certificate common name will be considered as the username.</p>
<p>Use <code>--htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd</code> to provide an htpasswd file. This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic authentication. Bcrypt is recommended.</p>
<p>To create an htpasswd file:</p>
<pre><code>touch htpasswd
htpasswd -B htpasswd user
htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser</code></pre>
<p>The password file can be updated while rclone is running.</p>
<p>Use <code>--realm</code> to set the authentication realm.</p>
<p>Use <code>--salt</code> to change the password hashing salt from the default.</p>
<h2 id="vfs---virtual-file-system-5">VFS - Virtual File System</h2>
<p>This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing system.</p>
<p>Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various options explained below.</p>
<p>The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-directory-cache-5">VFS Directory Cache</h2>
<p>Using the <code>--dir-cache-time</code> flag, you can control how long a directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the cache.</p>
<pre><code>--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)</code></pre>
<p>However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the polling interval.</p>
<p>You can send a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to rclone for it to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:</p>
<pre><code>kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)</code></pre>
<p>If you configure rclone with a <a href="/rc">remote control</a> then you can use rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget</code></pre>
<p>Or individual files or directories:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir</code></pre>
<h2 id="vfs-file-buffering-5">VFS File Buffering</h2>
<p>The <code>--buffer-size</code> flag determines the amount of memory, that will be used to buffer data in advance.</p>
<p>Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be shared.</p>
<p>This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.</p>
<p>The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to <code>--buffer-size * open files</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-file-caching-5">VFS File Caching</h2>
<p>These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.</p>
<p>For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.</p>
<p>Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may find that you need one or the other or both.</p>
<pre><code>--cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)</code></pre>
<p>If run with <code>-vv</code> rclone will print the location of the file cache. The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but can be controlled with <code>--cache-dir</code> or setting the appropriate environment variable.</p>
<p>The cache has 4 different modes selected by <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code>. The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using disk space.</p>
<p>Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed and if they haven't been accessed for <code>--vfs-write-back</code> seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.</p>
<p>If using <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> note that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every <code>--vfs-cache-poll-interval</code>. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> is exceeded, rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant files are likely to remain cached.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-cache-max-age</code> will evict files from the cache after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of 1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0 and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .</p>
<p>You <strong>should not</strong> run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using <code>--vfs-cache-mode &gt; off</code>. This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with <code>--cache-dir</code>. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-off-5">--vfs-cache-mode off</h3>
<p>In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.</p>
<p>This will mean some operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files can't be opened for both read AND write</li>
<li>Files opened for write can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only</li>
<li>Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied</li>
<li>Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-minimal-5">--vfs-cache-mode minimal</h3>
<p>This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.</p>
<p>These operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files opened for write only can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-writes-5">--vfs-cache-mode writes</h3>
<p>In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations.</p>
<p>If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing intervals up to 1 minute.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-full-5">--vfs-cache-mode full</h3>
<p>In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.</p>
<p>In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.</p>
<p>So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present in them.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations and is otherwise identical to <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> writes.</p>
<p>When reading a file rclone will read <code>--buffer-size</code> plus <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> bytes ahead. The <code>--buffer-size</code> is buffered in memory whereas the <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is buffered on disk.</p>
<p>When using this mode it is recommended that <code>--buffer-size</code> is not set too large and <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is set large if required.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> not all file systems support sparse files. In particular FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message if one is detected.</p>
<h3 id="fingerprinting-5">Fingerprinting</h3>
<p>Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made from:</p>
<ul>
<li>size</li>
<li>modification time</li>
<li>hash</li>
</ul>
<p>where available on an object.</p>
<p>On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).</p>
<p>For example <code>hash</code> is slow with the <code>local</code> and <code>sftp</code> backends as they have to read the entire file and hash it, and <code>modtime</code> is slow with the <code>s3</code>, <code>swift</code>, <code>ftp</code> and <code>qinqstor</code> backends because they need to do an extra API call to fetch it.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-fast-fingerprint</code> flag then rclone will not include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the opening time of cached files.</p>
<p>If you are running a vfs cache over <code>local</code>, <code>s3</code> or <code>swift</code> backends then using this flag is recommended.</p>
<p>Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to be downloaded again.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-chunked-reading-5">VFS Chunked Reading</h2>
<p>When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.</p>
<p>These flags control the chunking:</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
--vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once</code></pre>
<p>The chunking behaves differently depending on the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> parameter.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-10"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> == 0</h3>
<p>Rclone will start reading a chunk of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, and then double the size for each read. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit</code> is specified, and greater than <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, the chunk size for each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.</p>
<p>With <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0</code> the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M</code> is specified, the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.</p>
<p>Setting <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> to <code>0</code> or "off" disables chunked reading.</p>
<p>The chunks will not be buffered in memory.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-11"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> &gt; 0</h3>
<p>Rclone reads <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> chunks of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> concurrently. The size for each read will stay constant.</p>
<p>This improves performance performance massively on high latency links or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.</p>
<p>Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> as these will depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.</p>
<p>For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to start might be <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M</code>. In testing with AWS S3 the performance scaled roughly as the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> setting.</p>
<p>Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on the latency they may need more <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> in order to get the throughput.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-performance-5">VFS Performance</h2>
<p>These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for performance or other reasons. See also the <a href="#vfs-chunked-reading">chunked reading</a> feature.</p>
<p>In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the <code>--no-modtime</code> flag (or use <code>--use-server-modtime</code> for a slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a transaction.</p>
<pre><code>--no-checksum     Don&#39;t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don&#39;t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don&#39;t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)</code></pre>
<p>When using VFS write caching (<code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> with value writes or full), the global flag <code>--transfers</code> can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache (the related global flag <code>--checkers</code> has no effect on the VFS).</p>
<pre><code>--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)</code></pre>
<h2 id="symlinks-5">Symlinks</h2>
<p>By default the VFS does not support symlinks. However this may be enabled with either of the following flags:</p>
<pre><code>--links      Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension.
--vfs-links  Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension for the VFS</code></pre>
<p>As most cloud storage systems do not support symlinks directly, rclone stores the symlink as a normal file with a special extension. So a file which appears as a symlink <code>link-to-file.txt</code> would be stored on cloud storage as <code>link-to-file.txt.rclonelink</code> and the contents would be the path to the symlink destination.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--links</code> enables symlink translation globally in rclone - this includes any backend which supports the concept (for example the local backend). <code>--vfs-links</code> just enables it for the VFS layer.</p>
<p>This scheme is compatible with that used by the <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#symlinks-junction-points">local backend with the --local-links flag</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-links</code> flag has been designed for <code>rclone mount</code>, <code>rclone nfsmount</code> and <code>rclone serve nfs</code>.</p>
<p>It hasn't been tested with the other <code>rclone serve</code> commands yet.</p>
<p>A limitation of the current implementation is that it expects the caller to resolve sub-symlinks. For example given this directory tree</p>
<pre><code>.
├── dir
│   └── file.txt
└── linked-dir -&gt; dir</code></pre>
<p>The VFS will correctly resolve <code>linked-dir</code> but not <code>linked-dir/file.txt</code>. This is not a problem for the tested commands but may be for other commands.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that there is an outstanding issue with symlink support <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8245">issue #8245</a> with duplicate files being created when symlinks are moved into directories where there is a file of the same name (or vice versa).</p>
<h2 id="vfs-case-sensitivity-5">VFS Case Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.</p>
<p>File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.</p>
<p>Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-case-insensitive</code> VFS flag controls how rclone handles these two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.</p>
<p>The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by the underlying remote.</p>
<p>Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.</p>
<p>If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".</p>
<p>The <code>--no-unicode-normalization</code> flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is performed for filenames that differ but are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">canonically equivalent</a> with respect to unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS, which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is therefore highly recommended to keep the default of <code>false</code> on macOS, to avoid encoding compatibility issues.</p>
<p>In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the <code>--vfs-block-norm-dupes</code> flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount, and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. <code>--vfs-block- norm-dupes</code> prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in <code>rclone sync</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-disk-options-5">VFS Disk Options</h2>
<p>This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system. It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)</code></pre>
<h2 id="alternate-report-of-used-bytes-5">Alternate report of used bytes</h2>
<p>Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used. If you need this information to be available when running <code>df</code> on the filesystem, then pass the flag <code>--vfs-used-is-size</code> to rclone. With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to <code>rclone size</code> and compute the total used space itself.</p>
<p><em>WARNING.</em> Contrary to <code>rclone size</code>, this flag ignores filters so that the result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-metadata-5">VFS Metadata</h2>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-metadata-extension</code> flag you can get the VFS to expose files which contain the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata">metadata</a> as a JSON blob. These files will not appear in the directory listing, but can be <code>stat</code>-ed and opened and once they have been they <strong>will</strong> appear in directory listings until the directory cache expires.</p>
<p>Note that some backends won't create metadata unless you pass in the <code>--metadata</code> flag.</p>
<p>For example, using <code>rclone mount</code> with <code>--metadata --vfs-metadata-extension .metadata</code> we get</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l /mnt/
total 1048577
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1073741824 Mar  3 16:03 1G

$ cat /mnt/1G.metadata
{
        &quot;atime&quot;: &quot;2025-03-04T17:34:22.317069787Z&quot;,
        &quot;btime&quot;: &quot;2025-03-03T16:03:37.708253808Z&quot;,
        &quot;gid&quot;: &quot;1000&quot;,
        &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;100664&quot;,
        &quot;mtime&quot;: &quot;2025-03-03T16:03:39.640238323Z&quot;,
        &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;1000&quot;
}

$ ls -l /mnt/
total 1048578
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1073741824 Mar  3 16:03 1G
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user        185 Mar  3 16:03 1G.metadata</code></pre>
<p>If the file has no metadata it will be returned as <code>{}</code> and if there is an error reading the metadata the error will be returned as <code>{"error":"error string"}</code>.</p>
<h2 id="auth-proxy-1">Auth Proxy</h2>
<p>If you supply the parameter <code>--auth-proxy /path/to/program</code> then rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which then are used to authenticate incoming requests. This uses a simple JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> <code>--auth-proxy</code> and <code>--authorized-keys</code> cannot be used together, if <code>--auth-proxy</code> is set the authorized keys option will be ignored.</p>
<p>There is an example program <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/bin/test_proxy.py">bin/test_proxy.py</a> in the rclone source code.</p>
<p>The program's job is to take a <code>user</code> and <code>pass</code> on the input and turn those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format. This config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but it won't use configuration from environment variables or command line options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete config.</p>
<p>This config generated must have this extra parameter - <code>_root</code> - root to use for the backend</p>
<p>And it may have this parameter - <code>_obscure</code> - comma separated strings for parameters to obscure</p>
<p>If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;user&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,
    &quot;pass&quot;: &quot;mypassword&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;user&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,
    &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>And as an example return this on STDOUT</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sftp&quot;,
    &quot;_root&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
    &quot;_obscure&quot;: &quot;pass&quot;,
    &quot;user&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,
    &quot;pass&quot;: &quot;mypassword&quot;,
    &quot;host&quot;: &quot;sftp.example.com&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the <code>user</code> and <code>pass</code>/<code>public_key</code> returned in the output to the host given. Note that since <code>_obscure</code> is set to <code>pass</code>, rclone will obscure the <code>pass</code> parameter before creating the backend (which is required for sftp backends).</p>
<p>The program can manipulate the supplied <code>user</code> in any way, for example to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the <code>user</code> be <code>user@example.com</code> and then set the <code>host</code> to <code>example.com</code> in the output and the user to <code>user</code>. For security you'd probably want to restrict the <code>host</code> to a limited list.</p>
<p>Note that an internal cache is keyed on <code>user</code> so only use that for configuration, don't use <code>pass</code> or <code>public_key</code>. This also means that if a user's password or public-key is changed the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it takes effect.</p>
<p>This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend that rclone supports.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="rclone-serve-nfs">rclone serve nfs</h1>
<p>Serve the remote as an NFS mount</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-69">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Create an NFS server that serves the given remote over the network.</p>
<p>This implements an NFSv3 server to serve any rclone remote via NFS.</p>
<p>The primary purpose for this command is to enable the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/">mount command</a> on recent macOS versions where installing FUSE is very cumbersome.</p>
<p>This server does not implement any authentication so any client will be able to access the data. To limit access, you can use <code>serve nfs</code> on the loopback address or rely on secure tunnels (such as SSH) or use firewalling.</p>
<p>For this reason, by default, a random TCP port is chosen and the loopback interface is used for the listening address by default; meaning that it is only available to the local machine. If you want other machines to access the NFS mount over local network, you need to specify the listening address and port using the <code>--addr</code> flag.</p>
<p>Modifying files through the NFS protocol requires VFS caching. Usually you will need to specify <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> in order to be able to write to the mountpoint (<code>full</code> is recommended). If you don't specify VFS cache mode, the mount will be read-only.</p>
<p><code>--nfs-cache-type</code> controls the type of the NFS handle cache. By default this is <code>memory</code> where new handles will be randomly allocated when needed. These are stored in memory. If the server is restarted the handle cache will be lost and connected NFS clients will get stale handle errors.</p>
<p><code>--nfs-cache-type disk</code> uses an on disk NFS handle cache. Rclone hashes the path of the object and stores it in a file named after the hash. These hashes are stored on disk the directory controlled by <code>--cache-dir</code> or the exact directory may be specified with <code>--nfs-cache-dir</code>. Using this means that the NFS server can be restarted at will without affecting the connected clients.</p>
<p><code>--nfs-cache-type symlink</code> is similar to <code>--nfs-cache-type disk</code> in that it uses an on disk cache, but the cache entries are held as symlinks. Rclone will use the handle of the underlying file as the NFS handle which improves performance. This sort of cache can't be backed up and restored as the underlying handles will change. This is Linux only. It requires running rclone as root or with <code>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH</code>. You can run rclone with this extra permission by doing this to the rclone binary <code>sudo setcap cap_dac_read_search+ep /path/to/rclone</code>.</p>
<p><code>--nfs-cache-handle-limit</code> controls the maximum number of cached NFS handles stored by the caching handler. This should not be set too low or you may experience errors when trying to access files. The default is <code>1000000</code>, but consider lowering this limit if the server's system resource usage causes problems. This is only used by the <code>memory</code> type cache.</p>
<p>To serve NFS over the network use following command:</p>
<pre><code>rclone serve nfs remote: --addr 0.0.0.0:$PORT --vfs-cache-mode=full</code></pre>
<p>This specifies a port that can be used in the mount command. To mount the server under Linux/macOS, use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>mount -t nfs -o port=$PORT,mountport=$PORT,tcp $HOSTNAME:/ path/to/mountpoint</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>$PORT</code> is the same port number used in the <code>serve nfs</code> command and <code>$HOSTNAME</code> is the network address of the machine that <code>serve nfs</code> was run on.</p>
<p>If <code>--vfs-metadata-extension</code> is in use then for the <code>--nfs-cache-type disk</code> and <code>--nfs-cache-type cache</code> the metadata files will have the file handle of their parent file suffixed with <code>0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01</code>. This means they can be looked up directly from the parent file handle is desired.</p>
<p>This command is only available on Unix platforms.</p>
<h2 id="vfs---virtual-file-system-6">VFS - Virtual File System</h2>
<p>This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing system.</p>
<p>Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various options explained below.</p>
<p>The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-directory-cache-6">VFS Directory Cache</h2>
<p>Using the <code>--dir-cache-time</code> flag, you can control how long a directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the cache.</p>
<pre><code>--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)</code></pre>
<p>However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the polling interval.</p>
<p>You can send a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to rclone for it to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:</p>
<pre><code>kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)</code></pre>
<p>If you configure rclone with a <a href="/rc">remote control</a> then you can use rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget</code></pre>
<p>Or individual files or directories:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir</code></pre>
<h2 id="vfs-file-buffering-6">VFS File Buffering</h2>
<p>The <code>--buffer-size</code> flag determines the amount of memory, that will be used to buffer data in advance.</p>
<p>Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be shared.</p>
<p>This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.</p>
<p>The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to <code>--buffer-size * open files</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-file-caching-6">VFS File Caching</h2>
<p>These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.</p>
<p>For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.</p>
<p>Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may find that you need one or the other or both.</p>
<pre><code>--cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)</code></pre>
<p>If run with <code>-vv</code> rclone will print the location of the file cache. The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but can be controlled with <code>--cache-dir</code> or setting the appropriate environment variable.</p>
<p>The cache has 4 different modes selected by <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code>. The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using disk space.</p>
<p>Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed and if they haven't been accessed for <code>--vfs-write-back</code> seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.</p>
<p>If using <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> note that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every <code>--vfs-cache-poll-interval</code>. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> is exceeded, rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant files are likely to remain cached.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-cache-max-age</code> will evict files from the cache after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of 1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0 and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .</p>
<p>You <strong>should not</strong> run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using <code>--vfs-cache-mode &gt; off</code>. This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with <code>--cache-dir</code>. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-off-6">--vfs-cache-mode off</h3>
<p>In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.</p>
<p>This will mean some operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files can't be opened for both read AND write</li>
<li>Files opened for write can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only</li>
<li>Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied</li>
<li>Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-minimal-6">--vfs-cache-mode minimal</h3>
<p>This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.</p>
<p>These operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files opened for write only can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-writes-6">--vfs-cache-mode writes</h3>
<p>In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations.</p>
<p>If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing intervals up to 1 minute.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-full-6">--vfs-cache-mode full</h3>
<p>In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.</p>
<p>In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.</p>
<p>So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present in them.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations and is otherwise identical to <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> writes.</p>
<p>When reading a file rclone will read <code>--buffer-size</code> plus <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> bytes ahead. The <code>--buffer-size</code> is buffered in memory whereas the <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is buffered on disk.</p>
<p>When using this mode it is recommended that <code>--buffer-size</code> is not set too large and <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is set large if required.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> not all file systems support sparse files. In particular FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message if one is detected.</p>
<h3 id="fingerprinting-6">Fingerprinting</h3>
<p>Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made from:</p>
<ul>
<li>size</li>
<li>modification time</li>
<li>hash</li>
</ul>
<p>where available on an object.</p>
<p>On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).</p>
<p>For example <code>hash</code> is slow with the <code>local</code> and <code>sftp</code> backends as they have to read the entire file and hash it, and <code>modtime</code> is slow with the <code>s3</code>, <code>swift</code>, <code>ftp</code> and <code>qinqstor</code> backends because they need to do an extra API call to fetch it.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-fast-fingerprint</code> flag then rclone will not include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the opening time of cached files.</p>
<p>If you are running a vfs cache over <code>local</code>, <code>s3</code> or <code>swift</code> backends then using this flag is recommended.</p>
<p>Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to be downloaded again.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-chunked-reading-6">VFS Chunked Reading</h2>
<p>When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.</p>
<p>These flags control the chunking:</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
--vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once</code></pre>
<p>The chunking behaves differently depending on the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> parameter.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-12"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> == 0</h3>
<p>Rclone will start reading a chunk of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, and then double the size for each read. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit</code> is specified, and greater than <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, the chunk size for each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.</p>
<p>With <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0</code> the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M</code> is specified, the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.</p>
<p>Setting <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> to <code>0</code> or "off" disables chunked reading.</p>
<p>The chunks will not be buffered in memory.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-13"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> &gt; 0</h3>
<p>Rclone reads <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> chunks of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> concurrently. The size for each read will stay constant.</p>
<p>This improves performance performance massively on high latency links or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.</p>
<p>Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> as these will depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.</p>
<p>For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to start might be <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M</code>. In testing with AWS S3 the performance scaled roughly as the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> setting.</p>
<p>Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on the latency they may need more <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> in order to get the throughput.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-performance-6">VFS Performance</h2>
<p>These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for performance or other reasons. See also the <a href="#vfs-chunked-reading">chunked reading</a> feature.</p>
<p>In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the <code>--no-modtime</code> flag (or use <code>--use-server-modtime</code> for a slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a transaction.</p>
<pre><code>--no-checksum     Don&#39;t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don&#39;t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don&#39;t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)</code></pre>
<p>When using VFS write caching (<code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> with value writes or full), the global flag <code>--transfers</code> can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache (the related global flag <code>--checkers</code> has no effect on the VFS).</p>
<pre><code>--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)</code></pre>
<h2 id="symlinks-6">Symlinks</h2>
<p>By default the VFS does not support symlinks. However this may be enabled with either of the following flags:</p>
<pre><code>--links      Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension.
--vfs-links  Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension for the VFS</code></pre>
<p>As most cloud storage systems do not support symlinks directly, rclone stores the symlink as a normal file with a special extension. So a file which appears as a symlink <code>link-to-file.txt</code> would be stored on cloud storage as <code>link-to-file.txt.rclonelink</code> and the contents would be the path to the symlink destination.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--links</code> enables symlink translation globally in rclone - this includes any backend which supports the concept (for example the local backend). <code>--vfs-links</code> just enables it for the VFS layer.</p>
<p>This scheme is compatible with that used by the <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#symlinks-junction-points">local backend with the --local-links flag</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-links</code> flag has been designed for <code>rclone mount</code>, <code>rclone nfsmount</code> and <code>rclone serve nfs</code>.</p>
<p>It hasn't been tested with the other <code>rclone serve</code> commands yet.</p>
<p>A limitation of the current implementation is that it expects the caller to resolve sub-symlinks. For example given this directory tree</p>
<pre><code>.
├── dir
│   └── file.txt
└── linked-dir -&gt; dir</code></pre>
<p>The VFS will correctly resolve <code>linked-dir</code> but not <code>linked-dir/file.txt</code>. This is not a problem for the tested commands but may be for other commands.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that there is an outstanding issue with symlink support <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8245">issue #8245</a> with duplicate files being created when symlinks are moved into directories where there is a file of the same name (or vice versa).</p>
<h2 id="vfs-case-sensitivity-6">VFS Case Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.</p>
<p>File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.</p>
<p>Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-case-insensitive</code> VFS flag controls how rclone handles these two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.</p>
<p>The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by the underlying remote.</p>
<p>Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.</p>
<p>If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".</p>
<p>The <code>--no-unicode-normalization</code> flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is performed for filenames that differ but are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">canonically equivalent</a> with respect to unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS, which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is therefore highly recommended to keep the default of <code>false</code> on macOS, to avoid encoding compatibility issues.</p>
<p>In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the <code>--vfs-block-norm-dupes</code> flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount, and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. <code>--vfs-block- norm-dupes</code> prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in <code>rclone sync</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-disk-options-6">VFS Disk Options</h2>
<p>This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system. It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)</code></pre>
<h2 id="alternate-report-of-used-bytes-6">Alternate report of used bytes</h2>
<p>Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used. If you need this information to be available when running <code>df</code> on the filesystem, then pass the flag <code>--vfs-used-is-size</code> to rclone. With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to <code>rclone size</code> and compute the total used space itself.</p>
<p><em>WARNING.</em> Contrary to <code>rclone size</code>, this flag ignores filters so that the result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-metadata-6">VFS Metadata</h2>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-metadata-extension</code> flag you can get the VFS to expose files which contain the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata">metadata</a> as a JSON blob. These files will not appear in the directory listing, but can be <code>stat</code>-ed and opened and once they have been they <strong>will</strong> appear in directory listings until the directory cache expires.</p>
<p>Note that some backends won't create metadata unless you pass in the <code>--metadata</code> flag.</p>
<p>For example, using <code>rclone mount</code> with <code>--metadata --vfs-metadata-extension .metadata</code> we get</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l /mnt/
total 1048577
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1073741824 Mar  3 16:03 1G

<h1 id="rclone-serve-restic">rclone serve restic</h1>
<p>Serve the remote for restic's REST API.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-70">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Run a basic web server to serve a remote over restic's REST backend API over HTTP. This allows restic to use rclone as a data storage mechanism for cloud providers that restic does not support directly.</p>
<p><a href="https://restic.net/">Restic</a> is a command-line program for doing backups.</p>
<p>The server will log errors. Use -v to see access logs.</p>
<p><code>--bwlimit</code> will be respected for file transfers. Use <code>--stats</code> to control the stats printing.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-rclone-for-use-by-restic">Setting up rclone for use by restic</h2>
<p>First <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#configure">set up a remote for your chosen cloud provider</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have set up the remote, check it is working with, for example "rclone lsd remote:". You may have called the remote something other than "remote:" - just substitute whatever you called it in the following instructions.</p>
<p>Now start the rclone restic server</p>
<pre><code>rclone serve restic -v remote:backup</code></pre>
<p>Where you can replace "backup" in the above by whatever path in the remote you wish to use.</p>
<p>By default this will serve on "localhost:8080" you can change this with use of the <code>--addr</code> flag.</p>
<p>You might wish to start this server on boot.</p>
<p>Adding <code>--cache-objects=false</code> will cause rclone to stop caching objects returned from the List call. Caching is normally desirable as it speeds up downloading objects, saves transactions and uses very little memory.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-restic-to-use-rclone">Setting up restic to use rclone</h2>
<p>Now you can <a href="http://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#rest-server">follow the restic instructions</a> on setting up restic.</p>
<p>Note that you will need restic 0.8.2 or later to interoperate with rclone.</p>
<p>For the example above you will want to use "http://localhost:8080/" as the URL for the REST server.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/
$ export RESTIC_PASSWORD=yourpassword
$ restic init
created restic backend 8b1a4b56ae at rest:http://localhost:8080/

Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access
the repository. Losing your password means that your data is
irrecoverably lost.
$ restic backup /path/to/files/to/backup
scan [/path/to/files/to/backup]
scanned 189 directories, 312 files in 0:00
[0:00] 100.00%  38.128 MiB / 38.128 MiB  501 / 501 items  0 errors  ETA 0:00
duration: 0:00
snapshot 45c8fdd8 saved</code></pre>
<h3 id="multiple-repositories">Multiple repositories</h3>
<p>Note that you can use the endpoint to host multiple repositories. Do this by adding a directory name or path after the URL. Note that these <strong>must</strong> end with /. Eg</p>
<pre><code>$ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user1repo/
# backup user1 stuff
$ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user2repo/
# backup user2 stuff</code></pre>
<h3 id="private-repositories">Private repositories</h3>
<p>The<code>--private-repos</code> flag can be used to limit users to repositories starting with a path of <code>/&lt;username&gt;/</code>.</p>
<h2 id="server-options-4">Server options</h2>
<p>Use <code>--addr</code> to specify which IP address and port the server should listen on, eg <code>--addr 1.2.3.4:8000</code> or <code>--addr :8080</code> to listen to all IPs. By default it only listens on localhost. You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.</p>
<p>If you set <code>--addr</code> to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.</p>
<p>You can use a unix socket by setting the url to <code>unix:///path/to/socket</code> or just by using an absolute path name.</p>
<p><code>--addr</code> may be repeated to listen on multiple IPs/ports/sockets. Socket activation, described further below, can also be used to accomplish the same.</p>
<p><code>--server-read-timeout</code> and <code>--server-write-timeout</code> can be used to control the timeouts on the server. Note that this is the total time for a transfer.</p>
<p><code>--max-header-bytes</code> controls the maximum number of bytes the server will accept in the HTTP header.</p>
<p><code>--baseurl</code> controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from. By default rclone will serve from the root. If you used <code>--baseurl "/rclone"</code> then rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/". This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve. Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing "/" on <code>--baseurl</code>, so <code>--baseurl "rclone"</code>, <code>--baseurl "/rclone"</code> and <code>--baseurl "/rclone/"</code> are all treated identically.</p>
<h3 id="tls-ssl-2">TLS (SSL)</h3>
<p>By default this will serve over http. If you want you can serve over https. You will need to supply the <code>--cert</code> and <code>--key</code> flags. If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need to supply <code>--client-ca</code> also.</p>
<p><code>--cert</code> must be set to the path of a file containing either a PEM encoded certificate, or a concatenation of that with the CA certificate. <code>--key</code> must be set to the path of a file with the PEM encoded private key. If setting <code>--client-ca</code>, it should be set to the path of a file with PEM encoded client certificate authority certificates.</p>
<p><code>--min-tls-version</code> is minimum TLS version that is acceptable. Valid values are "tls1.0", "tls1.1", "tls1.2" and "tls1.3" (default "tls1.0").</p>
<h2 id="socket-activation-2">Socket activation</h2>
<p>Instead of the listening addresses specified above, rclone will listen to all FDs passed by the service manager, if any (and ignore any arguments passed by <code>--addr</code>).</p>
<p>This allows rclone to be a socket-activated service. It can be configured with .socket and .service unit files as described in https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html</p>
<p>Socket activation can be tested ad-hoc with the <code>systemd-socket-activate</code>command</p>
<pre><code>   systemd-socket-activate -l 8000 -- rclone serve</code></pre>
<p>This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 8000 over TCP. ### Authentication</p>
<p>By default this will serve files without needing a login.</p>
<p>You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set a single username and password with the <code>--user</code> and <code>--pass</code> flags.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can have the reverse proxy manage authentication and use the username provided in the configured header with <code>--user-from-header</code> (e.g., <code>----user-from-header=x-remote-user</code>). Ensure the proxy is trusted and headers cannot be spoofed, as misconfiguration may lead to unauthorized access.</p>
<p>If either of the above authentication methods is not configured and client certificates are required by the <code>--client-ca</code> flag passed to the server, the client certificate common name will be considered as the username.</p>
<p>Use <code>--htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd</code> to provide an htpasswd file. This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic authentication. Bcrypt is recommended.</p>
<p>To create an htpasswd file:</p>
<pre><code>touch htpasswd
htpasswd -B htpasswd user
htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser</code></pre>
<p>The password file can be updated while rclone is running.</p>
<p>Use <code>--realm</code> to set the authentication realm.</p>
<p>Use <code>--salt</code> to change the password hashing salt from the default.</p>
<pre><code>rclone serve restic remote:path [flags]</code></pre>

<h1 id="rclone-serve-s3">rclone serve s3</h1>
<p>Serve remote:path over s3.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-71">Synopsis</h2>
<p><code>serve s3</code> implements a basic s3 server that serves a remote via s3. This can be viewed with an s3 client, or you can make an <a href="https://rclone.org/s3/">s3 type remote</a> to read and write to it with rclone.</p>
<p><code>serve s3</code> is considered <strong>Experimental</strong> so use with care.</p>
<p>S3 server supports Signature Version 4 authentication. Just use <code>--auth-key accessKey,secretKey</code> and set the <code>Authorization</code> header correctly in the request. (See the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">AWS docs</a>).</p>
<p><code>--auth-key</code> can be repeated for multiple auth pairs. If <code>--auth-key</code> is not provided then <code>serve s3</code> will allow anonymous access.</p>
<p>Please note that some clients may require HTTPS endpoints. See <a href="#tls-ssl">the SSL docs</a> for more information.</p>
<p>This command uses the <a href="#vfs-virtual-file-system">VFS directory cache</a>. All the functionality will work with <code>--vfs-cache-mode off</code>. Using <code>--vfs-cache-mode full</code> (or <code>writes</code>) can be used to cache objects locally to improve performance.</p>
<p>Use <code>--force-path-style=false</code> if you want to use the bucket name as a part of the hostname (such as mybucket.local)</p>
<p>Use <code>--etag-hash</code> if you want to change the hash uses for the <code>ETag</code>. Note that using anything other than <code>MD5</code> (the default) is likely to cause problems for S3 clients which rely on the Etag being the MD5.</p>
<h2 id="quickstart-1">Quickstart</h2>
<p>For a simple set up, to serve <code>remote:path</code> over s3, run the server like this:</p>
<pre><code>rclone serve s3 --auth-key ACCESS_KEY_ID,SECRET_ACCESS_KEY remote:path</code></pre>
<p>For example, to use a simple folder in the filesystem, run the server with a command like this:</p>
<pre><code>rclone serve s3 --auth-key ACCESS_KEY_ID,SECRET_ACCESS_KEY local:/path/to/folder</code></pre>
<p>The <code>rclone.conf</code> for the server could look like this:</p>
<pre><code>[local]
type = local</code></pre>
<p>The <code>local</code> configuration is optional though. If you run the server with a <code>remote:path</code> like <code>/path/to/folder</code> (without the <code>local:</code> prefix and without an <code>rclone.conf</code> file), rclone will fall back to a default configuration, which will be visible as a warning in the logs. But it will run nonetheless.</p>
<p>This will be compatible with an rclone (client) remote configuration which is defined like this:</p>
<pre><code>[serves3]
type = s3
provider = Rclone
endpoint = http://127.0.0.1:8080/
access_key_id = ACCESS_KEY_ID
secret_access_key = SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
use_multipart_uploads = false</code></pre>
<p>Note that setting <code>use_multipart_uploads = false</code> is to work around <a href="#bugs">a bug</a> which will be fixed in due course.</p>
<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>
<p>When uploading multipart files <code>serve s3</code> holds all the parts in memory (see <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7453">#7453</a>). This is a limitaton of the library rclone uses for serving S3 and will hopefully be fixed at some point.</p>
<p>Multipart server side copies do not work (see <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7454">#7454</a>). These take a very long time and eventually fail. The default threshold for multipart server side copies is 5G which is the maximum it can be, so files above this side will fail to be server side copied.</p>
<p>For a current list of <code>serve s3</code> bugs see the <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/labels/serve%20s3">serve s3</a> bug category on GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-2">Limitations</h2>
<p><code>serve s3</code> will treat all directories in the root as buckets and ignore all files in the root. You can use <code>CreateBucket</code> to create folders under the root, but you can't create empty folders under other folders not in the root.</p>
<p>When using <code>PutObject</code> or <code>DeleteObject</code>, rclone will automatically create or clean up empty folders. If you don't want to clean up empty folders automatically, use <code>--no-cleanup</code>.</p>
<p>When using <code>ListObjects</code>, rclone will use <code>/</code> when the delimiter is empty. This reduces backend requests with no effect on most operations, but if the delimiter is something other than <code>/</code> and empty, rclone will do a full recursive search of the backend, which can take some time.</p>
<p>Versioning is not currently supported.</p>
<p>Metadata will only be saved in memory other than the rclone <code>mtime</code> metadata which will be set as the modification time of the file.</p>
<h2 id="supported-operations">Supported operations</h2>
<p><code>serve s3</code> currently supports the following operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bucket

<p>This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 8000 over TCP. ## VFS - Virtual File System</p>
<p>This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing system.</p>
<p>Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various options explained below.</p>
<p>The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-directory-cache-7">VFS Directory Cache</h2>
<p>Using the <code>--dir-cache-time</code> flag, you can control how long a directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the cache.</p>
<pre><code>--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)</code></pre>
<p>However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the polling interval.</p>
<p>You can send a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to rclone for it to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:</p>
<pre><code>kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)</code></pre>
<p>If you configure rclone with a <a href="/rc">remote control</a> then you can use rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget</code></pre>
<p>Or individual files or directories:</p>

<p>The <code>--buffer-size</code> flag determines the amount of memory, that will be used to buffer data in advance.</p>
<p>Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be shared.</p>
<p>This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.</p>
<p>The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to <code>--buffer-size * open files</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-file-caching-7">VFS File Caching</h2>
<p>These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.</p>
<p>For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.</p>
<p>Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may find that you need one or the other or both.</p>
<pre><code>--cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)</code></pre>
<p>If run with <code>-vv</code> rclone will print the location of the file cache. The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but can be controlled with <code>--cache-dir</code> or setting the appropriate environment variable.</p>
<p>The cache has 4 different modes selected by <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code>. The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using disk space.</p>
<p>Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed and if they haven't been accessed for <code>--vfs-write-back</code> seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.</p>
<p>If using <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> note that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every <code>--vfs-cache-poll-interval</code>. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> is exceeded, rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant files are likely to remain cached.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-cache-max-age</code> will evict files from the cache after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of 1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0 and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .</p>
<p>You <strong>should not</strong> run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using <code>--vfs-cache-mode &gt; off</code>. This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with <code>--cache-dir</code>. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-off-7">--vfs-cache-mode off</h3>
<p>In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.</p>
<p>This will mean some operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files can't be opened for both read AND write</li>
<li>Files opened for write can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only</li>
<li>Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied</li>
<li>Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-minimal-7">--vfs-cache-mode minimal</h3>
<p>This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.</p>
<p>These operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files opened for write only can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-writes-7">--vfs-cache-mode writes</h3>
<p>In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations.</p>
<p>If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing intervals up to 1 minute.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-full-7">--vfs-cache-mode full</h3>
<p>In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.</p>
<p>In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.</p>
<p>So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present in them.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations and is otherwise identical to <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> writes.</p>
<p>When reading a file rclone will read <code>--buffer-size</code> plus <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> bytes ahead. The <code>--buffer-size</code> is buffered in memory whereas the <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is buffered on disk.</p>
<p>When using this mode it is recommended that <code>--buffer-size</code> is not set too large and <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is set large if required.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> not all file systems support sparse files. In particular FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message if one is detected.</p>
<h3 id="fingerprinting-7">Fingerprinting</h3>
<p>Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made from:</p>
<ul>
<li>size</li>
<li>modification time</li>
<li>hash</li>
</ul>
<p>where available on an object.</p>
<p>On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).</p>
<p>For example <code>hash</code> is slow with the <code>local</code> and <code>sftp</code> backends as they have to read the entire file and hash it, and <code>modtime</code> is slow with the <code>s3</code>, <code>swift</code>, <code>ftp</code> and <code>qinqstor</code> backends because they need to do an extra API call to fetch it.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-fast-fingerprint</code> flag then rclone will not include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the opening time of cached files.</p>
<p>If you are running a vfs cache over <code>local</code>, <code>s3</code> or <code>swift</code> backends then using this flag is recommended.</p>
<p>Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to be downloaded again.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-chunked-reading-7">VFS Chunked Reading</h2>
<p>When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.</p>
<p>These flags control the chunking:</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
--vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once</code></pre>
<p>The chunking behaves differently depending on the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> parameter.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-14"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> == 0</h3>
<p>Rclone will start reading a chunk of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, and then double the size for each read. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit</code> is specified, and greater than <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, the chunk size for each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.</p>
<p>With <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0</code> the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M</code> is specified, the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.</p>
<p>Setting <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> to <code>0</code> or "off" disables chunked reading.</p>
<p>The chunks will not be buffered in memory.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-15"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> &gt; 0</h3>
<p>Rclone reads <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> chunks of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> concurrently. The size for each read will stay constant.</p>
<p>This improves performance performance massively on high latency links or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.</p>
<p>Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> as these will depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.</p>
<p>For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to start might be <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M</code>. In testing with AWS S3 the performance scaled roughly as the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> setting.</p>
<p>Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on the latency they may need more <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> in order to get the throughput.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-performance-7">VFS Performance</h2>
<p>These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for performance or other reasons. See also the <a href="#vfs-chunked-reading">chunked reading</a> feature.</p>
<p>In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the <code>--no-modtime</code> flag (or use <code>--use-server-modtime</code> for a slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a transaction.</p>
<pre><code>--no-checksum     Don&#39;t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don&#39;t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don&#39;t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)</code></pre>
<p>When using VFS write caching (<code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> with value writes or full), the global flag <code>--transfers</code> can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache (the related global flag <code>--checkers</code> has no effect on the VFS).</p>
<pre><code>--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)</code></pre>
<h2 id="symlinks-7">Symlinks</h2>
<p>By default the VFS does not support symlinks. However this may be enabled with either of the following flags:</p>
<pre><code>--links      Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension.
--vfs-links  Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension for the VFS</code></pre>
<p>As most cloud storage systems do not support symlinks directly, rclone stores the symlink as a normal file with a special extension. So a file which appears as a symlink <code>link-to-file.txt</code> would be stored on cloud storage as <code>link-to-file.txt.rclonelink</code> and the contents would be the path to the symlink destination.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--links</code> enables symlink translation globally in rclone - this includes any backend which supports the concept (for example the local backend). <code>--vfs-links</code> just enables it for the VFS layer.</p>
<p>This scheme is compatible with that used by the <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#symlinks-junction-points">local backend with the --local-links flag</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-links</code> flag has been designed for <code>rclone mount</code>, <code>rclone nfsmount</code> and <code>rclone serve nfs</code>.</p>
<p>It hasn't been tested with the other <code>rclone serve</code> commands yet.</p>
<p>A limitation of the current implementation is that it expects the caller to resolve sub-symlinks. For example given this directory tree</p>
<pre><code>.
├── dir
│   └── file.txt
└── linked-dir -&gt; dir</code></pre>
<p>The VFS will correctly resolve <code>linked-dir</code> but not <code>linked-dir/file.txt</code>. This is not a problem for the tested commands but may be for other commands.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that there is an outstanding issue with symlink support <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8245">issue #8245</a> with duplicate files being created when symlinks are moved into directories where there is a file of the same name (or vice versa).</p>
<h2 id="vfs-case-sensitivity-7">VFS Case Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.</p>
<p>File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.</p>
<p>Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-case-insensitive</code> VFS flag controls how rclone handles these two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.</p>
<p>The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by the underlying remote.</p>
<p>Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.</p>
<p>If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".</p>
<p>The <code>--no-unicode-normalization</code> flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is performed for filenames that differ but are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">canonically equivalent</a> with respect to unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS, which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is therefore highly recommended to keep the default of <code>false</code> on macOS, to avoid encoding compatibility issues.</p>
<p>In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the <code>--vfs-block-norm-dupes</code> flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount, and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. <code>--vfs-block- norm-dupes</code> prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in <code>rclone sync</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-disk-options-7">VFS Disk Options</h2>
<p>This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system. It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)</code></pre>
<h2 id="alternate-report-of-used-bytes-7">Alternate report of used bytes</h2>
<p>Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used. If you need this information to be available when running <code>df</code> on the filesystem, then pass the flag <code>--vfs-used-is-size</code> to rclone. With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to <code>rclone size</code> and compute the total used space itself.</p>
<p><em>WARNING.</em> Contrary to <code>rclone size</code>, this flag ignores filters so that the result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-metadata-7">VFS Metadata</h2>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-metadata-extension</code> flag you can get the VFS to expose files which contain the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata">metadata</a> as a JSON blob. These files will not appear in the directory listing, but can be <code>stat</code>-ed and opened and once they have been they <strong>will</strong> appear in directory listings until the directory cache expires.</p>
<p>Note that some backends won't create metadata unless you pass in the <code>--metadata</code> flag.</p>
<p>For example, using <code>rclone mount</code> with <code>--metadata --vfs-metadata-extension .metadata</code> we get</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l /mnt/
total 1048577
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1073741824 Mar  3 16:03 1G

</ul>
<h1 id="rclone-serve-sftp">rclone serve sftp</h1>
<p>Serve the remote over SFTP.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-72">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Run an SFTP server to serve a remote over SFTP. This can be used with an SFTP client or you can make a remote of type <a href="/sftp">sftp</a> to use with it.</p>
<p>You can use the <a href="/filtering">filter</a> flags (e.g. <code>--include</code>, <code>--exclude</code>) to control what is served.</p>
<p>The server will respond to a small number of shell commands, mainly md5sum, sha1sum and df, which enable it to provide support for checksums and the about feature when accessed from an sftp remote.</p>
<p>Note that this server uses standard 32 KiB packet payload size, which means you must not configure the client to expect anything else, e.g. with the <a href="https://rclone.org/sftp/#sftp-chunk-size">chunk_size</a> option on an sftp remote.</p>
<p>The server will log errors. Use <code>-v</code> to see access logs.</p>
<p><code>--bwlimit</code> will be respected for file transfers. Use <code>--stats</code> to control the stats printing.</p>
<p>You must provide some means of authentication, either with <code>--user</code>/<code>--pass</code>, an authorized keys file (specify location with <code>--authorized-keys</code> - the default is the same as ssh), an <code>--auth-proxy</code>, or set the <code>--no-auth</code> flag for no authentication when logging in.</p>
<p>If you don't supply a host <code>--key</code> then rclone will generate rsa, ecdsa and ed25519 variants, and cache them for later use in rclone's cache directory (see <code>rclone help flags cache-dir</code>) in the "serve-sftp" directory.</p>
<p>By default the server binds to localhost:2022 - if you want it to be reachable externally then supply <code>--addr :2022</code> for example.</p>
<p>This also supports being run with socket activation, in which case it will listen on the first passed FD. It can be configured with .socket and .service unit files as described in https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html</p>
<p>Socket activation can be tested ad-hoc with the <code>systemd-socket-activate</code>command:</p>
<pre><code>systemd-socket-activate -l 2222 -- rclone serve sftp :local:vfs/</code></pre>
<p>This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 2222 over TCP.</p>
<p>Note that the default of <code>--vfs-cache-mode off</code> is fine for the rclone sftp backend, but it may not be with other SFTP clients.</p>
<p>If <code>--stdio</code> is specified, rclone will serve SFTP over stdio, which can be used with sshd via ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, for example:</p>
<pre><code>restrict,command=&quot;rclone serve sftp --stdio ./photos&quot; ssh-rsa ...</code></pre>
<p>On the client you need to set <code>--transfers 1</code> when using <code>--stdio</code>. Otherwise multiple instances of the rclone server are started by OpenSSH which can lead to "corrupted on transfer" errors. This is the case because the client chooses indiscriminately which server to send commands to while the servers all have different views of the state of the filing system.</p>
<p>The "restrict" in authorized_keys prevents SHA1SUMs and MD5SUMs from being used. Omitting "restrict" and using <code>--sftp-path-override</code> to enable checksumming is possible but less secure and you could use the SFTP server provided by OpenSSH in this case.</p>
<h2 id="vfs---virtual-file-system-7">VFS - Virtual File System</h2>
<p>This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing system.</p>
<p>Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various options explained below.</p>
<p>The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-directory-cache-8">VFS Directory Cache</h2>
<p>Using the <code>--dir-cache-time</code> flag, you can control how long a directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the cache.</p>
<pre><code>--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)</code></pre>
<p>However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the polling interval.</p>
<p>You can send a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to rclone for it to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:</p>
<pre><code>kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)</code></pre>
<p>If you configure rclone with a <a href="/rc">remote control</a> then you can use rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget</code></pre>
<p>Or individual files or directories:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir</code></pre>
<h2 id="vfs-file-buffering-8">VFS File Buffering</h2>
<p>The <code>--buffer-size</code> flag determines the amount of memory, that will be used to buffer data in advance.</p>
<p>Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be shared.</p>
<p>This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.</p>
<p>The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to <code>--buffer-size * open files</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-file-caching-8">VFS File Caching</h2>
<p>These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.</p>
<p>For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.</p>
<p>Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may find that you need one or the other or both.</p>
<pre><code>--cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)</code></pre>
<p>If run with <code>-vv</code> rclone will print the location of the file cache. The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but can be controlled with <code>--cache-dir</code> or setting the appropriate environment variable.</p>
<p>The cache has 4 different modes selected by <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code>. The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using disk space.</p>
<p>Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed and if they haven't been accessed for <code>--vfs-write-back</code> seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.</p>
<p>If using <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> note that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every <code>--vfs-cache-poll-interval</code>. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> is exceeded, rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant files are likely to remain cached.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-cache-max-age</code> will evict files from the cache after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of 1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0 and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .</p>
<p>You <strong>should not</strong> run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using <code>--vfs-cache-mode &gt; off</code>. This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with <code>--cache-dir</code>. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-off-8">--vfs-cache-mode off</h3>
<p>In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.</p>
<p>This will mean some operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files can't be opened for both read AND write</li>
<li>Files opened for write can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only</li>
<li>Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied</li>
<li>Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-minimal-8">--vfs-cache-mode minimal</h3>
<p>This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.</p>
<p>These operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files opened for write only can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-writes-8">--vfs-cache-mode writes</h3>
<p>In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations.</p>
<p>If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing intervals up to 1 minute.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-full-8">--vfs-cache-mode full</h3>
<p>In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.</p>
<p>In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.</p>
<p>So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present in them.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations and is otherwise identical to <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> writes.</p>
<p>When reading a file rclone will read <code>--buffer-size</code> plus <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> bytes ahead. The <code>--buffer-size</code> is buffered in memory whereas the <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is buffered on disk.</p>
<p>When using this mode it is recommended that <code>--buffer-size</code> is not set too large and <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is set large if required.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> not all file systems support sparse files. In particular FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message if one is detected.</p>
<h3 id="fingerprinting-8">Fingerprinting</h3>
<p>Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made from:</p>
<ul>
<li>size</li>
<li>modification time</li>
<li>hash</li>
</ul>
<p>where available on an object.</p>
<p>On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).</p>
<p>For example <code>hash</code> is slow with the <code>local</code> and <code>sftp</code> backends as they have to read the entire file and hash it, and <code>modtime</code> is slow with the <code>s3</code>, <code>swift</code>, <code>ftp</code> and <code>qinqstor</code> backends because they need to do an extra API call to fetch it.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-fast-fingerprint</code> flag then rclone will not include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the opening time of cached files.</p>
<p>If you are running a vfs cache over <code>local</code>, <code>s3</code> or <code>swift</code> backends then using this flag is recommended.</p>
<p>Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to be downloaded again.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-chunked-reading-8">VFS Chunked Reading</h2>
<p>When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.</p>
<p>These flags control the chunking:</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
--vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once</code></pre>
<p>The chunking behaves differently depending on the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> parameter.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-16"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> == 0</h3>
<p>Rclone will start reading a chunk of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, and then double the size for each read. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit</code> is specified, and greater than <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, the chunk size for each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.</p>
<p>With <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0</code> the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M</code> is specified, the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.</p>
<p>Setting <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> to <code>0</code> or "off" disables chunked reading.</p>
<p>The chunks will not be buffered in memory.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-17"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> &gt; 0</h3>
<p>Rclone reads <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> chunks of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> concurrently. The size for each read will stay constant.</p>
<p>This improves performance performance massively on high latency links or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.</p>
<p>Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> as these will depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.</p>
<p>For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to start might be <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M</code>. In testing with AWS S3 the performance scaled roughly as the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> setting.</p>
<p>Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on the latency they may need more <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> in order to get the throughput.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-performance-8">VFS Performance</h2>
<p>These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for performance or other reasons. See also the <a href="#vfs-chunked-reading">chunked reading</a> feature.</p>
<p>In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the <code>--no-modtime</code> flag (or use <code>--use-server-modtime</code> for a slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a transaction.</p>
<pre><code>--no-checksum     Don&#39;t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don&#39;t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don&#39;t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)</code></pre>
<p>When using VFS write caching (<code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> with value writes or full), the global flag <code>--transfers</code> can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache (the related global flag <code>--checkers</code> has no effect on the VFS).</p>
<pre><code>--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)</code></pre>
<h2 id="symlinks-8">Symlinks</h2>
<p>By default the VFS does not support symlinks. However this may be enabled with either of the following flags:</p>
<pre><code>--links      Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension.
--vfs-links  Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension for the VFS</code></pre>
<p>As most cloud storage systems do not support symlinks directly, rclone stores the symlink as a normal file with a special extension. So a file which appears as a symlink <code>link-to-file.txt</code> would be stored on cloud storage as <code>link-to-file.txt.rclonelink</code> and the contents would be the path to the symlink destination.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--links</code> enables symlink translation globally in rclone - this includes any backend which supports the concept (for example the local backend). <code>--vfs-links</code> just enables it for the VFS layer.</p>
<p>This scheme is compatible with that used by the <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#symlinks-junction-points">local backend with the --local-links flag</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-links</code> flag has been designed for <code>rclone mount</code>, <code>rclone nfsmount</code> and <code>rclone serve nfs</code>.</p>
<p>It hasn't been tested with the other <code>rclone serve</code> commands yet.</p>
<p>A limitation of the current implementation is that it expects the caller to resolve sub-symlinks. For example given this directory tree</p>
<pre><code>.
├── dir
│   └── file.txt
└── linked-dir -&gt; dir</code></pre>
<p>The VFS will correctly resolve <code>linked-dir</code> but not <code>linked-dir/file.txt</code>. This is not a problem for the tested commands but may be for other commands.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that there is an outstanding issue with symlink support <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8245">issue #8245</a> with duplicate files being created when symlinks are moved into directories where there is a file of the same name (or vice versa).</p>
<h2 id="vfs-case-sensitivity-8">VFS Case Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.</p>
<p>File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.</p>
<p>Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-case-insensitive</code> VFS flag controls how rclone handles these two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.</p>
<p>The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by the underlying remote.</p>
<p>Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.</p>
<p>If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".</p>
<p>The <code>--no-unicode-normalization</code> flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is performed for filenames that differ but are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">canonically equivalent</a> with respect to unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS, which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is therefore highly recommended to keep the default of <code>false</code> on macOS, to avoid encoding compatibility issues.</p>
<p>In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the <code>--vfs-block-norm-dupes</code> flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount, and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. <code>--vfs-block- norm-dupes</code> prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in <code>rclone sync</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-disk-options-8">VFS Disk Options</h2>
<p>This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system. It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)</code></pre>
<h2 id="alternate-report-of-used-bytes-8">Alternate report of used bytes</h2>
<p>Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used. If you need this information to be available when running <code>df</code> on the filesystem, then pass the flag <code>--vfs-used-is-size</code> to rclone. With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to <code>rclone size</code> and compute the total used space itself.</p>
<p><em>WARNING.</em> Contrary to <code>rclone size</code>, this flag ignores filters so that the result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-metadata-8">VFS Metadata</h2>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-metadata-extension</code> flag you can get the VFS to expose files which contain the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata">metadata</a> as a JSON blob. These files will not appear in the directory listing, but can be <code>stat</code>-ed and opened and once they have been they <strong>will</strong> appear in directory listings until the directory cache expires.</p>
<p>Note that some backends won't create metadata unless you pass in the <code>--metadata</code> flag.</p>
<p>For example, using <code>rclone mount</code> with <code>--metadata --vfs-metadata-extension .metadata</code> we get</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l /mnt/
total 1048577
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1073741824 Mar  3 16:03 1G

-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user        185 Mar  3 16:03 1G.metadata</code></pre>
<p>If the file has no metadata it will be returned as <code>{}</code> and if there is an error reading the metadata the error will be returned as <code>{"error":"error string"}</code>.</p>
<h2 id="auth-proxy-2">Auth Proxy</h2>
<p>If you supply the parameter <code>--auth-proxy /path/to/program</code> then rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which then are used to authenticate incoming requests. This uses a simple JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> <code>--auth-proxy</code> and <code>--authorized-keys</code> cannot be used together, if <code>--auth-proxy</code> is set the authorized keys option will be ignored.</p>
<p>There is an example program <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/bin/test_proxy.py">bin/test_proxy.py</a> in the rclone source code.</p>
<p>The program's job is to take a <code>user</code> and <code>pass</code> on the input and turn those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format. This config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but it won't use configuration from environment variables or command line options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete config.</p>
<p>This config generated must have this extra parameter - <code>_root</code> - root to use for the backend</p>
<p>And it may have this parameter - <code>_obscure</code> - comma separated strings for parameters to obscure</p>
<p>If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;user&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,
    &quot;pass&quot;: &quot;mypassword&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;user&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,
    &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>And as an example return this on STDOUT</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sftp&quot;,
    &quot;_root&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
    &quot;_obscure&quot;: &quot;pass&quot;,
    &quot;user&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,
    &quot;pass&quot;: &quot;mypassword&quot;,
    &quot;host&quot;: &quot;sftp.example.com&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the <code>user</code> and <code>pass</code>/<code>public_key</code> returned in the output to the host given. Note that since <code>_obscure</code> is set to <code>pass</code>, rclone will obscure the <code>pass</code> parameter before creating the backend (which is required for sftp backends).</p>
<p>The program can manipulate the supplied <code>user</code> in any way, for example to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the <code>user</code> be <code>user@example.com</code> and then set the <code>host</code> to <code>example.com</code> in the output and the user to <code>user</code>. For security you'd probably want to restrict the <code>host</code> to a limited list.</p>
<p>Note that an internal cache is keyed on <code>user</code> so only use that for configuration, don't use <code>pass</code> or <code>public_key</code>. This also means that if a user's password or public-key is changed the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it takes effect.</p>
<p>This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend that rclone supports.</p>

<h2 id="access-webdav-on-windows">Access WebDAV on Windows</h2>
<p>WebDAV shared folder can be mapped as a drive on Windows, however the default settings prevent it. Windows will fail to connect to the server using insecure Basic authentication. It will not even display any login dialog. Windows requires SSL / HTTPS connection to be used with Basic. If you try to connect via Add Network Location Wizard you will get the following error: "The folder you entered does not appear to be valid. Please choose another". However, you still can connect if you set the following registry key on a client machine: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINEto 2. The BasicAuthLevel can be set to the following values: 0 - Basic authentication disabled 1 - Basic authentication enabled for SSL connections only 2 - Basic authentication enabled for SSL connections and for non-SSL connections If required, increase the FileSizeLimitInBytes to a higher value. Navigate to the Services interface, then restart the WebClient service.</p>

<h2 id="serving-over-a-unix-socket">Serving over a unix socket</h2>
<p>You can serve the webdav on a unix socket like this:</p>
<pre><code>rclone serve webdav --addr unix:///tmp/my.socket remote:path</code></pre>
<p>and connect to it like this using rclone and the webdav backend:</p>
<pre><code>rclone --webdav-unix-socket /tmp/my.socket --webdav-url http://localhost lsf :webdav:</code></pre>
<p>Note that there is no authentication on http protocol - this is expected to be done by the permissions on the socket.</p>
<h2 id="server-options-6">Server options</h2>
<p>Use <code>--addr</code> to specify which IP address and port the server should listen on, eg <code>--addr 1.2.3.4:8000</code> or <code>--addr :8080</code> to listen to all IPs. By default it only listens on localhost. You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.</p>
<p>If you set <code>--addr</code> to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.</p>
<p>You can use a unix socket by setting the url to <code>unix:///path/to/socket</code> or just by using an absolute path name.</p>
<p><code>--addr</code> may be repeated to listen on multiple IPs/ports/sockets. Socket activation, described further below, can also be used to accomplish the same.</p>
<p><code>--server-read-timeout</code> and <code>--server-write-timeout</code> can be used to control the timeouts on the server. Note that this is the total time for a transfer.</p>
<p><code>--max-header-bytes</code> controls the maximum number of bytes the server will accept in the HTTP header.</p>
<p><code>--baseurl</code> controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from. By default rclone will serve from the root. If you used <code>--baseurl "/rclone"</code> then rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/". This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve. Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing "/" on <code>--baseurl</code>, so <code>--baseurl "rclone"</code>, <code>--baseurl "/rclone"</code> and <code>--baseurl "/rclone/"</code> are all treated identically.</p>
<h3 id="tls-ssl-4">TLS (SSL)</h3>
<p>By default this will serve over http. If you want you can serve over https. You will need to supply the <code>--cert</code> and <code>--key</code> flags. If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need to supply <code>--client-ca</code> also.</p>
<p><code>--cert</code> must be set to the path of a file containing either a PEM encoded certificate, or a concatenation of that with the CA certificate. <code>--key</code> must be set to the path of a file with the PEM encoded private key. If setting <code>--client-ca</code>, it should be set to the path of a file with PEM encoded client certificate authority certificates.</p>
<p><code>--min-tls-version</code> is minimum TLS version that is acceptable. Valid values are "tls1.0", "tls1.1", "tls1.2" and "tls1.3" (default "tls1.0").</p>
<h2 id="socket-activation-4">Socket activation</h2>
<p>Instead of the listening addresses specified above, rclone will listen to all FDs passed by the service manager, if any (and ignore any arguments passed by <code>--addr</code>).</p>
<p>This allows rclone to be a socket-activated service. It can be configured with .socket and .service unit files as described in https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html</p>
<p>Socket activation can be tested ad-hoc with the <code>systemd-socket-activate</code>command</p>
<pre><code>   systemd-socket-activate -l 8000 -- rclone serve</code></pre>
<p>This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 8000 over TCP. ### Template</p>
<p><code>--template</code> allows a user to specify a custom markup template for HTTP and WebDAV serve functions. The server exports the following markup to be used within the template to server pages:</p>

<h3 id="authentication-4">Authentication</h3>
<p>By default this will serve files without needing a login.</p>
<p>You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set a single username and password with the <code>--user</code> and <code>--pass</code> flags.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can have the reverse proxy manage authentication and use the username provided in the configured header with <code>--user-from-header</code> (e.g., <code>----user-from-header=x-remote-user</code>). Ensure the proxy is trusted and headers cannot be spoofed, as misconfiguration may lead to unauthorized access.</p>
<p>If either of the above authentication methods is not configured and client certificates are required by the <code>--client-ca</code> flag passed to the server, the client certificate common name will be considered as the username.</p>
<p>Use <code>--htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd</code> to provide an htpasswd file. This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic authentication. Bcrypt is recommended.</p>
<p>To create an htpasswd file:</p>
<pre><code>touch htpasswd
htpasswd -B htpasswd user
htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser</code></pre>
<p>The password file can be updated while rclone is running.</p>
<p>Use <code>--realm</code> to set the authentication realm.</p>
<p>Use <code>--salt</code> to change the password hashing salt from the default.</p>
<h2 id="vfs---virtual-file-system-8">VFS - Virtual File System</h2>
<p>This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing system.</p>
<p>Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various options explained below.</p>
<p>The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-directory-cache-9">VFS Directory Cache</h2>
<p>Using the <code>--dir-cache-time</code> flag, you can control how long a directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the cache.</p>
<pre><code>--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)</code></pre>
<p>However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the polling interval.</p>
<p>You can send a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to rclone for it to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:</p>
<pre><code>kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)</code></pre>
<p>If you configure rclone with a <a href="/rc">remote control</a> then you can use rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget</code></pre>
<p>Or individual files or directories:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir</code></pre>
<h2 id="vfs-file-buffering-9">VFS File Buffering</h2>
<p>The <code>--buffer-size</code> flag determines the amount of memory, that will be used to buffer data in advance.</p>
<p>Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be shared.</p>
<p>This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.</p>
<p>The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to <code>--buffer-size * open files</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-file-caching-9">VFS File Caching</h2>
<p>These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.</p>
<p>For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.</p>
<p>Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may find that you need one or the other or both.</p>
<pre><code>--cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)</code></pre>
<p>If run with <code>-vv</code> rclone will print the location of the file cache. The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but can be controlled with <code>--cache-dir</code> or setting the appropriate environment variable.</p>
<p>The cache has 4 different modes selected by <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code>. The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using disk space.</p>
<p>Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed and if they haven't been accessed for <code>--vfs-write-back</code> seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.</p>
<p>If using <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> note that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every <code>--vfs-cache-poll-interval</code>. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When <code>--vfs-cache-max-size</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-min-free-space</code> is exceeded, rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant files are likely to remain cached.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-cache-max-age</code> will evict files from the cache after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of 1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0 and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .</p>
<p>You <strong>should not</strong> run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using <code>--vfs-cache-mode &gt; off</code>. This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with <code>--cache-dir</code>. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-off-9">--vfs-cache-mode off</h3>
<p>In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.</p>
<p>This will mean some operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files can't be opened for both read AND write</li>
<li>Files opened for write can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only</li>
<li>Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied</li>
<li>Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-minimal-9">--vfs-cache-mode minimal</h3>
<p>This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.</p>
<p>These operations are not possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Files opened for write only can't be seeked</li>
<li>Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set</li>
<li>Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC</li>
<li>If an upload fails it can't be retried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-writes-9">--vfs-cache-mode writes</h3>
<p>In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations.</p>
<p>If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing intervals up to 1 minute.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-cache-mode-full-9">--vfs-cache-mode full</h3>
<p>In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.</p>
<p>In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.</p>
<p>So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present in them.</p>
<p>This mode should support all normal file system operations and is otherwise identical to <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> writes.</p>
<p>When reading a file rclone will read <code>--buffer-size</code> plus <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> bytes ahead. The <code>--buffer-size</code> is buffered in memory whereas the <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is buffered on disk.</p>
<p>When using this mode it is recommended that <code>--buffer-size</code> is not set too large and <code>--vfs-read-ahead</code> is set large if required.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> not all file systems support sparse files. In particular FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message if one is detected.</p>
<h3 id="fingerprinting-9">Fingerprinting</h3>
<p>Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made from:</p>
<ul>
<li>size</li>
<li>modification time</li>
<li>hash</li>
</ul>
<p>where available on an object.</p>
<p>On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).</p>
<p>For example <code>hash</code> is slow with the <code>local</code> and <code>sftp</code> backends as they have to read the entire file and hash it, and <code>modtime</code> is slow with the <code>s3</code>, <code>swift</code>, <code>ftp</code> and <code>qinqstor</code> backends because they need to do an extra API call to fetch it.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-fast-fingerprint</code> flag then rclone will not include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the opening time of cached files.</p>
<p>If you are running a vfs cache over <code>local</code>, <code>s3</code> or <code>swift</code> backends then using this flag is recommended.</p>
<p>Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to be downloaded again.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-chunked-reading-9">VFS Chunked Reading</h2>
<p>When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.</p>
<p>These flags control the chunking:</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
--vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once</code></pre>
<p>The chunking behaves differently depending on the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> parameter.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-18"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> == 0</h3>
<p>Rclone will start reading a chunk of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, and then double the size for each read. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit</code> is specified, and greater than <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code>, the chunk size for each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.</p>
<p>With <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0</code> the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on. When <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M</code> is specified, the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.</p>
<p>Setting <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> to <code>0</code> or "off" disables chunked reading.</p>
<p>The chunks will not be buffered in memory.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-read-chunk-streams-0-19"><code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> &gt; 0</h3>
<p>Rclone reads <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> chunks of size <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> concurrently. The size for each read will stay constant.</p>
<p>This improves performance performance massively on high latency links or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.</p>
<p>Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> as these will depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.</p>
<p>For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to start might be <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16</code> and <code>--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M</code>. In testing with AWS S3 the performance scaled roughly as the <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> setting.</p>
<p>Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on the latency they may need more <code>--vfs-read-chunk-streams</code> in order to get the throughput.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-performance-9">VFS Performance</h2>
<p>These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for performance or other reasons. See also the <a href="#vfs-chunked-reading">chunked reading</a> feature.</p>
<p>In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the <code>--no-modtime</code> flag (or use <code>--use-server-modtime</code> for a slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a transaction.</p>
<pre><code>--no-checksum     Don&#39;t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don&#39;t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don&#39;t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)</code></pre>
<p>When using VFS write caching (<code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> with value writes or full), the global flag <code>--transfers</code> can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache (the related global flag <code>--checkers</code> has no effect on the VFS).</p>
<pre><code>--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)</code></pre>
<h2 id="symlinks-9">Symlinks</h2>
<p>By default the VFS does not support symlinks. However this may be enabled with either of the following flags:</p>
<pre><code>--links      Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension.
--vfs-links  Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a &#39;.rclonelink&#39; extension for the VFS</code></pre>
<p>As most cloud storage systems do not support symlinks directly, rclone stores the symlink as a normal file with a special extension. So a file which appears as a symlink <code>link-to-file.txt</code> would be stored on cloud storage as <code>link-to-file.txt.rclonelink</code> and the contents would be the path to the symlink destination.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--links</code> enables symlink translation globally in rclone - this includes any backend which supports the concept (for example the local backend). <code>--vfs-links</code> just enables it for the VFS layer.</p>
<p>This scheme is compatible with that used by the <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#symlinks-junction-points">local backend with the --local-links flag</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-links</code> flag has been designed for <code>rclone mount</code>, <code>rclone nfsmount</code> and <code>rclone serve nfs</code>.</p>
<p>It hasn't been tested with the other <code>rclone serve</code> commands yet.</p>
<p>A limitation of the current implementation is that it expects the caller to resolve sub-symlinks. For example given this directory tree</p>
<pre><code>.
├── dir
│   └── file.txt
└── linked-dir -&gt; dir</code></pre>
<p>The VFS will correctly resolve <code>linked-dir</code> but not <code>linked-dir/file.txt</code>. This is not a problem for the tested commands but may be for other commands.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that there is an outstanding issue with symlink support <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8245">issue #8245</a> with duplicate files being created when symlinks are moved into directories where there is a file of the same name (or vice versa).</p>
<h2 id="vfs-case-sensitivity-9">VFS Case Sensitivity</h2>
<p>Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.</p>
<p>File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving: although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.</p>
<p>Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.</p>
<p>The <code>--vfs-case-insensitive</code> VFS flag controls how rclone handles these two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.</p>
<p>The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by the underlying remote.</p>
<p>Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.</p>
<p>If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".</p>
<p>The <code>--no-unicode-normalization</code> flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is performed for filenames that differ but are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">canonically equivalent</a> with respect to unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS, which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is therefore highly recommended to keep the default of <code>false</code> on macOS, to avoid encoding compatibility issues.</p>
<p>In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the <code>--vfs-block-norm-dupes</code> flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount, and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. <code>--vfs-block- norm-dupes</code> prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in <code>rclone sync</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-disk-options-9">VFS Disk Options</h2>
<p>This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system. It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.</p>
<pre><code>--vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)</code></pre>
<h2 id="alternate-report-of-used-bytes-9">Alternate report of used bytes</h2>
<p>Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used. If you need this information to be available when running <code>df</code> on the filesystem, then pass the flag <code>--vfs-used-is-size</code> to rclone. With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to <code>rclone size</code> and compute the total used space itself.</p>
<p><em>WARNING.</em> Contrary to <code>rclone size</code>, this flag ignores filters so that the result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.</p>
<h2 id="vfs-metadata-9">VFS Metadata</h2>
<p>If you use the <code>--vfs-metadata-extension</code> flag you can get the VFS to expose files which contain the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata">metadata</a> as a JSON blob. These files will not appear in the directory listing, but can be <code>stat</code>-ed and opened and once they have been they <strong>will</strong> appear in directory listings until the directory cache expires.</p>
<p>Note that some backends won't create metadata unless you pass in the <code>--metadata</code> flag.</p>
<p>For example, using <code>rclone mount</code> with <code>--metadata --vfs-metadata-extension .metadata</code> we get</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l /mnt/
total 1048577
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1073741824 Mar  3 16:03 1G

$ cat /mnt/1G.metadata
{

        &quot;gid&quot;: &quot;1000&quot;,

        &quot;mtime&quot;: &quot;2025-03-03T16:03:39.640238323Z&quot;,
        &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;1000&quot;
}

$ ls -l /mnt/
total 1048578
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1073741824 Mar  3 16:03 1G
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user        185 Mar  3 16:03 1G.metadata</code></pre>
<p>If the file has no metadata it will be returned as <code>{}</code> and if there is an error reading the metadata the error will be returned as <code>{"error":"error string"}</code>.</p>
<h2 id="auth-proxy-3">Auth Proxy</h2>
<p>If you supply the parameter <code>--auth-proxy /path/to/program</code> then rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which then are used to authenticate incoming requests. This uses a simple JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> <code>--auth-proxy</code> and <code>--authorized-keys</code> cannot be used together, if <code>--auth-proxy</code> is set the authorized keys option will be ignored.</p>
<p>There is an example program <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/bin/test_proxy.py">bin/test_proxy.py</a> in the rclone source code.</p>
<p>The program's job is to take a <code>user</code> and <code>pass</code> on the input and turn those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format. This config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but it won't use configuration from environment variables or command line options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete config.</p>
<p>This config generated must have this extra parameter - <code>_root</code> - root to use for the backend</p>
<p>And it may have this parameter - <code>_obscure</code> - comma separated strings for parameters to obscure</p>
<p>If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;user&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,
    &quot;pass&quot;: &quot;mypassword&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;user&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,
    &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>And as an example return this on STDOUT</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sftp&quot;,
    &quot;_root&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
    &quot;_obscure&quot;: &quot;pass&quot;,
    &quot;user&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,
    &quot;pass&quot;: &quot;mypassword&quot;,
    &quot;host&quot;: &quot;sftp.example.com&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the <code>user</code> and <code>pass</code>/<code>public_key</code> returned in the output to the host given. Note that since <code>_obscure</code> is set to <code>pass</code>, rclone will obscure the <code>pass</code> parameter before creating the backend (which is required for sftp backends).</p>
<p>The program can manipulate the supplied <code>user</code> in any way, for example to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the <code>user</code> be <code>user@example.com</code> and then set the <code>host</code> to <code>example.com</code> in the output and the user to <code>user</code>. For security you'd probably want to restrict the <code>host</code> to a limited list.</p>
<p>Note that an internal cache is keyed on <code>user</code> so only use that for configuration, don't use <code>pass</code> or <code>public_key</code>. This also means that if a user's password or public-key is changed the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it takes effect.</p>
<p>This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend that rclone supports.</p>

<p>Changes storage class/tier of objects in remote.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-74">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Changes storage tier or class at remote if supported. Few cloud storage services provides different storage classes on objects, for example AWS S3 and Glacier, Azure Blob storage - Hot, Cool and Archive, Google Cloud Storage, Regional Storage, Nearline, Coldline etc.</p>
<p>Note that, certain tier changes make objects not available to access immediately. For example tiering to archive in azure blob storage makes objects in frozen state, user can restore by setting tier to Hot/Cool, similarly S3 to Glacier makes object inaccessible.true</p>
<p>You can use it to tier single object</p>
<pre><code>rclone settier Cool remote:path/file</code></pre>
<p>Or use rclone filters to set tier on only specific files</p>
<pre><code>rclone --include &quot;*.txt&quot; settier Hot remote:path/dir</code></pre>

<h1 id="rclone-tree">rclone tree</h1>
<p>List the contents of the remote in a tree like fashion.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis-79">Synopsis</h2>
<p>Lists the contents of a remote in a similar way to the unix tree command.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone tree remote:path
/
├── file1
├── file2
├── file3
└── subdir
    ├── file4
    └── file5

1 directories, 5 files</code></pre>
<p>You can use any of the filtering options with the tree command (e.g. <code>--include</code> and <code>--exclude</code>. You can also use <code>--fast-list</code>.</p>
<p>The tree command has many options for controlling the listing which are compatible with the tree command, for example you can include file sizes with <code>--size</code>. Note that not all of them have short options as they conflict with rclone's short options.</p>
<p>For a more interactive navigation of the remote see the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_ncdu/">ncdu</a> command.</p>

<h2 id="copying-single-files">Copying single files</h2>
<p>rclone normally syncs or copies directories. However, if the source remote points to a file, rclone will just copy that file. The destination remote must point to a directory - rclone will give the error <code>Failed to create file system for "remote:file": is a file not a directory</code> if it isn't.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have a remote with a file in called <code>test.jpg</code>, then you could copy just that file like this</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy remote:test.jpg /tmp/download</code></pre>
<p>The file <code>test.jpg</code> will be placed inside <code>/tmp/download</code>.</p>
<p>This is equivalent to specifying</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy --files-from /tmp/files remote: /tmp/download</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>/tmp/files</code> contains the single line</p>
<pre><code>test.jpg</code></pre>
<p>It is recommended to use <code>copy</code> when copying individual files, not <code>sync</code>. They have pretty much the same effect but <code>copy</code> will use a lot less memory.</p>
<h2 id="syntax-of-remote-paths">Syntax of remote paths</h2>
<p>The syntax of the paths passed to the rclone command are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="pathtodir">/path/to/dir</h3>
<p>This refers to the local file system.</p>
<p>On Windows <code>\</code> may be used instead of <code>/</code> in local paths <strong>only</strong>, non local paths must use <code>/</code>. See <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#paths-on-windows">local filesystem</a> documentation for more about Windows-specific paths.</p>
<p>These paths needn't start with a leading <code>/</code> - if they don't then they will be relative to the current directory.</p>
<h3 id="remotepathtodir">remote:path/to/dir</h3>
<p>This refers to a directory <code>path/to/dir</code> on <code>remote:</code> as defined in the config file (configured with <code>rclone config</code>).</p>
<h3 id="remotepathtodir-1">remote:/path/to/dir</h3>
<p>On most backends this is refers to the same directory as <code>remote:path/to/dir</code> and that format should be preferred. On a very small number of remotes (FTP, SFTP, Dropbox for business) this will refer to a different directory. On these, paths without a leading <code>/</code> will refer to your "home" directory and paths with a leading <code>/</code> will refer to the root.</p>
<h3 id="backendpathtodir">:backend:path/to/dir</h3>
<p>This is an advanced form for creating remotes on the fly. <code>backend</code> should be the name or prefix of a backend (the <code>type</code> in the config file) and all the configuration for the backend should be provided on the command line (or in environment variables).</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd --http-url https://pub.rclone.org :http:</code></pre>
<p>To list all the directories in the root of <code>https://pub.rclone.org/</code>.</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf --http-url https://example.com :http:path/to/dir</code></pre>
<p>To list files and directories in <code>https://example.com/path/to/dir/</code></p>
<pre><code>rclone copy --http-url https://example.com :http:path/to/dir /tmp/dir</code></pre>
<p>To copy files and directories in <code>https://example.com/path/to/dir</code> to <code>/tmp/dir</code>.</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy --sftp-host example.com :sftp:path/to/dir /tmp/dir</code></pre>
<p>To copy files and directories from <code>example.com</code> in the relative directory <code>path/to/dir</code> to <code>/tmp/dir</code> using sftp.</p>
<h3 id="connection-strings">Connection strings</h3>
<p>The above examples can also be written using a connection string syntax, so instead of providing the arguments as command line parameters <code>--http-url https://pub.rclone.org</code> they are provided as part of the remote specification as a kind of connection string.</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd &quot;:http,url=&#39;https://pub.rclone.org&#39;:&quot;
rclone lsf &quot;:http,url=&#39;https://example.com&#39;:path/to/dir&quot;
rclone copy &quot;:http,url=&#39;https://example.com&#39;:path/to/dir&quot; /tmp/dir
rclone copy :sftp,host=example.com:path/to/dir /tmp/dir</code></pre>
<p>These can apply to modify existing remotes as well as create new remotes with the on the fly syntax. This example is equivalent to adding the <code>--drive-shared-with-me</code> parameter to the remote <code>gdrive:</code>.</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf &quot;gdrive,shared_with_me:path/to/dir&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The major advantage to using the connection string style syntax is that it only applies to the remote, not to all the remotes of that type of the command line. A common confusion is this attempt to copy a file shared on google drive to the normal drive which <strong>does not work</strong> because the <code>--drive-shared-with-me</code> flag applies to both the source and the destination.</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy --drive-shared-with-me gdrive:shared-file.txt gdrive:</code></pre>
<p>However using the connection string syntax, this does work.</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy &quot;gdrive,shared_with_me:shared-file.txt&quot; gdrive:</code></pre>
<p>Note that the connection string only affects the options of the immediate backend. If for example gdriveCrypt is a crypt based on gdrive, then the following command <strong>will not work</strong> as intended, because <code>shared_with_me</code> is ignored by the crypt backend:</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy &quot;gdriveCrypt,shared_with_me:shared-file.txt&quot; gdriveCrypt:</code></pre>
<p>The connection strings have the following syntax</p>
<pre><code>remote,parameter=value,parameter2=value2:path/to/dir
:backend,parameter=value,parameter2=value2:path/to/dir</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>parameter</code> has a <code>:</code> or <code>,</code> then it must be placed in quotes <code>"</code> or <code>'</code>, so</p>
<pre><code>remote,parameter=&quot;colon:value&quot;,parameter2=&quot;comma,value&quot;:path/to/dir
:backend,parameter=&#39;colon:value&#39;,parameter2=&#39;comma,value&#39;:path/to/dir</code></pre>
<p>If a quoted value needs to include that quote, then it should be doubled, so</p>
<pre><code>remote,parameter=&quot;with&quot;&quot;quote&quot;,parameter2=&#39;with&#39;&#39;quote&#39;:path/to/dir</code></pre>
<p>This will make <code>parameter</code> be <code>with"quote</code> and <code>parameter2</code> be <code>with'quote</code>.</p>
<p>If you leave off the <code>=parameter</code> then rclone will substitute <code>=true</code> which works very well with flags. For example, to use s3 configured in the environment you could use:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd :s3,env_auth:</code></pre>
<p>Which is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd :s3,env_auth=true:</code></pre>
<p>Note that on the command line you might need to surround these connection strings with <code>"</code> or <code>'</code> to stop the shell interpreting any special characters within them.</p>
<p>If you are a shell master then you'll know which strings are OK and which aren't, but if you aren't sure then enclose them in <code>"</code> and use <code>'</code> as the inside quote. This syntax works on all OSes.</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy &quot;:http,url=&#39;https://example.com&#39;:path/to/dir&quot; /tmp/dir</code></pre>
<p>On Linux/macOS some characters are still interpreted inside <code>"</code> strings in the shell (notably <code>\</code> and <code>$</code> and <code>"</code>) so if your strings contain those you can swap the roles of <code>"</code> and <code>'</code> thus. (This syntax does not work on Windows.)</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy &#39;:http,url=&quot;https://example.com&quot;:path/to/dir&#39; /tmp/dir</code></pre>
<h4 id="connection-strings-config-and-logging">Connection strings, config and logging</h4>
<p>If you supply extra configuration to a backend by command line flag, environment variable or connection string then rclone will add a suffix based on the hash of the config to the name of the remote, eg</p>
<pre><code>rclone -vv lsf --s3-chunk-size 20M s3:</code></pre>
<p>Has the log message</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG : s3: detected overridden config - adding &quot;{Srj1p}&quot; suffix to name</code></pre>
<p>This is so rclone can tell the modified remote apart from the unmodified remote when caching the backends.</p>
<p>This should only be noticeable in the logs.</p>
<p>This means that on the fly backends such as</p>
<pre><code>rclone -vv lsf :s3,env_auth:</code></pre>
<p>Will get their own names</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG : :s3: detected overridden config - adding &quot;{YTu53}&quot; suffix to name</code></pre>
<h3 id="valid-remote-names">Valid remote names</h3>
<p>Remote names are case sensitive, and must adhere to the following rules: - May contain number, letter, <code>_</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>@</code> and space. - May not start with <code>-</code> or space. - May not end with space.</p>
<p>Starting with rclone version 1.61, any Unicode numbers and letters are allowed, while in older versions it was limited to plain ASCII (0-9, A-Z, a-z). If you use the same rclone configuration from different shells, which may be configured with different character encoding, you must be cautious to use characters that are possible to write in all of them. This is mostly a problem on Windows, where the console traditionally uses a non-Unicode character set - defined by the so-called "code page".</p>
<p>Do not use single character names on Windows as it creates ambiguity with Windows drives' names, e.g.: remote called <code>C</code> is indistinguishable from <code>C</code> drive. Rclone will always assume that single letter name refers to a drive.</p>
<h2 id="quoting-and-the-shell">Quoting and the shell</h2>
<p>When you are typing commands to your computer you are using something called the command line shell. This interprets various characters in an OS specific way.</p>
<p>Here are some gotchas which may help users unfamiliar with the shell rules</p>
<h3 id="linux-osx">Linux / OSX</h3>
<p>If your names have spaces or shell metacharacters (e.g. <code>*</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>$</code>, <code>'</code>, <code>"</code>, etc.) then you must quote them. Use single quotes <code>'</code> by default.</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy &#39;Important files?&#39; remote:backup</code></pre>
<p>If you want to send a <code>'</code> you will need to use <code>"</code>, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy &quot;O&#39;Reilly Reviews&quot; remote:backup</code></pre>
<p>The rules for quoting metacharacters are complicated and if you want the full details you'll have to consult the manual page for your shell.</p>
<h3 id="windows-1">Windows</h3>
<p>If your names have spaces in you need to put them in <code>"</code>, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy &quot;E:\folder name\folder name\folder name&quot; remote:backup</code></pre>
<p>If you are using the root directory on its own then don't quote it (see <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/464">#464</a> for why), e.g.</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy E:\ remote:backup</code></pre>
<h2 id="copying-files-or-directories-with-in-the-names">Copying files or directories with <code>:</code> in the names</h2>
<p>rclone uses <code>:</code> to mark a remote name. This is, however, a valid filename component in non-Windows OSes. The remote name parser will only search for a <code>:</code> up to the first <code>/</code> so if you need to act on a file or directory like this then use the full path starting with a <code>/</code>, or use <code>./</code> as a current directory prefix.</p>
<p>So to sync a directory called <code>sync:me</code> to a remote called <code>remote:</code> use</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive ./sync:me remote:path</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive /full/path/to/sync:me remote:path</code></pre>
<h2 id="server-side-copy">Server Side Copy</h2>
<p>Most remotes (but not all - see <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">the overview</a>) support server-side copy.</p>
<p>This means if you want to copy one folder to another then rclone won't download all the files and re-upload them; it will instruct the server to copy them in place.</p>
<p>Eg</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy s3:oldbucket s3:newbucket</code></pre>
<p>Will copy the contents of <code>oldbucket</code> to <code>newbucket</code> without downloading and re-uploading.</p>
<p>Remotes which don't support server-side copy <strong>will</strong> download and re-upload in this case.</p>
<p>Server side copies are used with <code>sync</code> and <code>copy</code> and will be identified in the log when using the <code>-v</code> flag. The <code>move</code> command may also use them if remote doesn't support server-side move directly. This is done by issuing a server-side copy then a delete which is much quicker than a download and re-upload.</p>
<p>Server side copies will only be attempted if the remote names are the same.</p>
<p>This can be used when scripting to make aged backups efficiently, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive remote:current-backup remote:previous-backup
rclone sync --interactive /path/to/files remote:current-backup</code></pre>
<h2 id="metadata">Metadata support</h2>
<p>Metadata is data about a file (or directory) which isn't the contents of the file (or directory). Normally rclone only preserves the modification time and the content (MIME) type where possible.</p>
<p>Rclone supports preserving all the available metadata on files and directories when using the <code>--metadata</code> or <code>-M</code> flag.</p>
<p>Exactly what metadata is supported and what that support means depends on the backend. Backends that support metadata have a metadata section in their docs and are listed in the <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#features">features table</a> (Eg <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#metadata">local</a>, <a href="/s3/#metadata">s3</a>)</p>
<p>Some backends don't support metadata, some only support metadata on files and some support metadata on both files and directories.</p>
<p>Rclone only supports a one-time sync of metadata. This means that metadata will be synced from the source object to the destination object only when the source object has changed and needs to be re-uploaded. If the metadata subsequently changes on the source object without changing the object itself then it won't be synced to the destination object. This is in line with the way rclone syncs <code>Content-Type</code> without the <code>--metadata</code> flag.</p>
<p>Using <code>--metadata</code> when syncing from local to local will preserve file attributes such as file mode, owner, extended attributes (not Windows).</p>
<p>Note that arbitrary metadata may be added to objects using the <code>--metadata-set key=value</code> flag when the object is first uploaded. This flag can be repeated as many times as necessary.</p>
<p>The <a href="#metadata-mapper">--metadata-mapper</a> flag can be used to pass the name of a program in which can transform metadata when it is being copied from source to destination.</p>
<p>Rclone supports <code>--metadata-set</code> and <code>--metadata-mapper</code> when doing sever side <code>Move</code> and server side <code>Copy</code>, but not when doing server side <code>DirMove</code> (renaming a directory) as this would involve recursing into the directory. Note that you can disable <code>DirMove</code> with <code>--disable DirMove</code> and rclone will revert back to using <code>Move</code> for each individual object where <code>--metadata-set</code> and <code>--metadata-mapper</code> are supported.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-metadata">Types of metadata</h3>
<p>Metadata is divided into two type. System metadata and User metadata.</p>
<p>Metadata which the backend uses itself is called system metadata. For example on the local backend the system metadata <code>uid</code> will store the user ID of the file when used on a unix based platform.</p>
<p>Arbitrary metadata is called user metadata and this can be set however is desired.</p>
<p>When objects are copied from backend to backend, they will attempt to interpret system metadata if it is supplied. Metadata may change from being user metadata to system metadata as objects are copied between different backends. For example copying an object from s3 sets the <code>content-type</code> metadata. In a backend which understands this (like <code>azureblob</code>) this will become the Content-Type of the object. In a backend which doesn't understand this (like the <code>local</code> backend) this will become user metadata. However should the local object be copied back to s3, the Content-Type will be set correctly.</p>
<h3 id="metadata-framework">Metadata framework</h3>
<p>Rclone implements a metadata framework which can read metadata from an object and write it to the object when (and only when) it is being uploaded.</p>
<p>This metadata is stored as a dictionary with string keys and string values.</p>
<p>There are some limits on the names of the keys (these may be clarified further in the future).</p>
<ul>
<li>must be lower case</li>
<li>may be <code>a-z</code> <code>0-9</code> containing <code>.</code> <code>-</code> or <code>_</code></li>
<li>length is backend dependent</li>
</ul>
<p>Each backend can provide system metadata that it understands. Some backends can also store arbitrary user metadata.</p>
<p>Where possible the key names are standardized, so, for example, it is possible to copy object metadata from s3 to azureblob for example and metadata will be translated appropriately.</p>
<p>Some backends have limits on the size of the metadata and rclone will give errors on upload if they are exceeded.</p>
<h3 id="metadata-preservation">Metadata preservation</h3>
<p>The goal of the implementation is to</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Preserve metadata if at all possible</li>
<li>Interpret metadata if at all possible</li>
</ol>
<p>The consequences of 1 is that you can copy an S3 object to a local disk then back to S3 losslessly. Likewise you can copy a local file with file attributes and xattrs from local disk to s3 and back again losslessly.</p>
<p>The consequence of 2 is that you can copy an S3 object with metadata to Azureblob (say) and have the metadata appear on the Azureblob object also.</p>

<p>The metadata keys <code>mtime</code> and <code>content-type</code> will take precedence if supplied in the metadata over reading the <code>Content-Type</code> or modification time of the source object.</p>

<h2 id="options-91">Options</h2>
<p>Rclone has a number of options to control its behaviour.</p>
<p>Options that take parameters can have the values passed in two ways, <code>--option=value</code> or <code>--option value</code>. However boolean (true/false) options behave slightly differently to the other options in that <code>--boolean</code> sets the option to <code>true</code> and the absence of the flag sets it to <code>false</code>. It is also possible to specify <code>--boolean=false</code> or <code>--boolean=true</code>. Note that <code>--boolean false</code> is not valid - this is parsed as <code>--boolean</code> and the <code>false</code> is parsed as an extra command line argument for rclone.</p>
<p>Options documented to take a <code>stringArray</code> parameter accept multiple values. To pass more than one value, repeat the option; for example: <code>--include value1 --include value2</code>.</p>
<h3 id="time-option">Time or duration options</h3>
<p>TIME or DURATION options can be specified as a duration string or a time string.</p>
<p>A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Default units are seconds or the following abbreviations are valid:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ms</code> - Milliseconds</li>
<li><code>s</code> - Seconds</li>
<li><code>m</code> - Minutes</li>
<li><code>h</code> - Hours</li>
<li><code>d</code> - Days</li>
<li><code>w</code> - Weeks</li>
<li><code>M</code> - Months</li>
<li><code>y</code> - Years</li>
</ul>
<p>These can also be specified as an absolute time in the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>RFC3339 - e.g. <code>2006-01-02T15:04:05Z</code> or <code>2006-01-02T15:04:05+07:00</code></li>
<li>ISO8601 Date and time, local timezone - <code>2006-01-02T15:04:05</code></li>
<li>ISO8601 Date and time, local timezone - <code>2006-01-02 15:04:05</code></li>
<li>ISO8601 Date - <code>2006-01-02</code> (YYYY-MM-DD)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="size-option">Size options</h3>
<p>Options which use SIZE use KiB (multiples of 1024 bytes) by default. However, a suffix of <code>B</code> for Byte, <code>K</code> for KiB, <code>M</code> for MiB, <code>G</code> for GiB, <code>T</code> for TiB and <code>P</code> for PiB may be used. These are the binary units, e.g. 1, 2**10, 2**20, 2**30 respectively.</p>
<h3 id="backup-dirdir">--backup-dir=DIR</h3>
<p>When using <code>sync</code>, <code>copy</code> or <code>move</code> any files which would have been overwritten or deleted are moved in their original hierarchy into this directory.</p>
<p>If <code>--suffix</code> is set, then the moved files will have the suffix added to them. If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has been added) in DIR, then it will be overwritten.</p>
<p>The remote in use must support server-side move or copy and you must use the same remote as the destination of the sync. The backup directory must not overlap the destination directory without it being excluded by a filter rule.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive /path/to/local remote:current --backup-dir remote:old</code></pre>
<p>will sync <code>/path/to/local</code> to <code>remote:current</code>, but for any files which would have been updated or deleted will be stored in <code>remote:old</code>.</p>
<p>If running rclone from a script you might want to use today's date as the directory name passed to <code>--backup-dir</code> to store the old files, or you might want to pass <code>--suffix</code> with today's date.</p>
<p>See <code>--compare-dest</code> and <code>--copy-dest</code>.</p>
<h3 id="bind-string">--bind string</h3>
<p>Local address to bind to for outgoing connections. This can be an IPv4 address (1.2.3.4), an IPv6 address (1234::789A) or host name. If the host name doesn't resolve or resolves to more than one IP address it will give an error.</p>
<p>You can use <code>--bind 0.0.0.0</code> to force rclone to use IPv4 addresses and <code>--bind ::0</code> to force rclone to use IPv6 addresses.</p>
<h3 id="bwlimitbandwidth_spec">--bwlimit=BANDWIDTH_SPEC</h3>
<p>This option controls the bandwidth limit. For example</p>
<pre><code>--bwlimit 10M</code></pre>
<p>would mean limit the upload and download bandwidth to 10 MiB/s. <strong>NB</strong> this is <strong>bytes</strong> per second not <strong>bits</strong> per second. To use a single limit, specify the desired bandwidth in KiB/s, or use a suffix B|K|M|G|T|P. The default is <code>0</code> which means to not limit bandwidth.</p>
<p>The upload and download bandwidth can be specified separately, as <code>--bwlimit UP:DOWN</code>, so</p>
<pre><code>--bwlimit 10M:100k</code></pre>
<p>would mean limit the upload bandwidth to 10 MiB/s and the download bandwidth to 100 KiB/s. Either limit can be "off" meaning no limit, so to just limit the upload bandwidth you would use</p>
<pre><code>--bwlimit 10M:off</code></pre>
<p>this would limit the upload bandwidth to 10 MiB/s but the download bandwidth would be unlimited.</p>
<p>When specified as above the bandwidth limits last for the duration of run of the rclone binary.</p>
<p>It is also possible to specify a "timetable" of limits, which will cause certain limits to be applied at certain times. To specify a timetable, format your entries as <code>WEEKDAY-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH WEEKDAY-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH...</code> where: <code>WEEKDAY</code> is optional element.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>BANDWIDTH</code> can be a single number, e.g.<code>100k</code> or a pair of numbers for upload:download, e.g.<code>10M:1M</code>.</li>
<li><code>WEEKDAY</code> can be written as the whole word or only using the first 3 characters. It is optional.</li>
<li><code>HH:MM</code> is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.</li>
</ul>
<p>Entries can be separated by spaces or semicolons.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Semicolons can be used as separators instead of spaces to avoid parsing issues in environments like Docker.</p>
<p>An example of a typical timetable to avoid link saturation during daytime working hours could be:</p>
<p>Using spaces as separators: <code>--bwlimit "08:00,512k 12:00,10M 13:00,512k 18:00,30M 23:00,off"</code></p>
<p>Using semicolons as separators: <code>--bwlimit "08:00,512k;12:00,10M;13:00,512k;18:00,30M;23:00,off"</code></p>
<p>In these examples, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512 KiB/s at 8am every day. At noon, it will rise to 10 MiB/s, and drop back to 512 KiB/sec at 1pm. At 6pm, the bandwidth limit will be set to 30 MiB/s, and at 11pm it will be completely disabled (full speed). Anything between 11pm and 8am will remain unlimited.</p>
<p>An example of timetable with <code>WEEKDAY</code> could be:</p>
<p>Using spaces as separators: <code>--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512 Fri-23:59,10M Sat-10:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"</code></p>
<p>Using semicolons as separators: <code>--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512;Fri-23:59,10M;Sat-10:00,1M;Sun-20:00,off"</code></p>
<p>It means that, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512 KiB/s on Monday. It will rise to 10 MiB/s before the end of Friday. At 10:00 on Saturday it will be set to 1 MiB/s. From 20:00 on Sunday it will be unlimited.</p>
<p>Timeslots without <code>WEEKDAY</code> are extended to the whole week. So this example:</p>
<p><code>--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512 12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"</code></p>
<p>Is equivalent to this:</p>
<p><code>--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512Mon-12:00,1M Tue-12:00,1M Wed-12:00,1M Thu-12:00,1M Fri-12:00,1M Sat-12:00,1M Sun-12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"</code></p>
<p>Bandwidth limit apply to the data transfer for all backends. For most backends the directory listing bandwidth is also included (exceptions being the non HTTP backends, <code>ftp</code>, <code>sftp</code> and <code>storj</code>).</p>
<p>Note that the units are <strong>Byte/s</strong>, not <strong>bit/s</strong>. Typically connections are measured in bit/s - to convert divide by 8. For example, let's say you have a 10 Mbit/s connection and you wish rclone to use half of it - 5 Mbit/s. This is 5/8 = 0.625 MiB/s so you would use a <code>--bwlimit 0.625M</code> parameter for rclone.</p>
<p>On Unix systems (Linux, macOS, …) the bandwidth limiter can be toggled by sending a <code>SIGUSR2</code> signal to rclone. This allows to remove the limitations of a long running rclone transfer and to restore it back to the value specified with <code>--bwlimit</code> quickly when needed. Assuming there is only one rclone instance running, you can toggle the limiter like this:</p>
<pre><code>kill -SIGUSR2 $(pidof rclone)</code></pre>
<p>If you configure rclone with a <a href="/rc">remote control</a> then you can use change the bwlimit dynamically:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc core/bwlimit rate=1M</code></pre>
<h3 id="bwlimit-filebandwidth_spec">--bwlimit-file=BANDWIDTH_SPEC</h3>
<p>This option controls per file bandwidth limit. For the options see the <code>--bwlimit</code> flag.</p>
<p>For example use this to allow no transfers to be faster than 1 MiB/s</p>
<pre><code>--bwlimit-file 1M</code></pre>
<p>This can be used in conjunction with <code>--bwlimit</code>.</p>
<p>Note that if a schedule is provided the file will use the schedule in effect at the start of the transfer.</p>
<h3 id="buffer-sizesize">--buffer-size=SIZE</h3>
<p>Use this sized buffer to speed up file transfers. Each <code>--transfer</code> will use this much memory for buffering.</p>
<p>When using <code>mount</code> or <code>cmount</code> each open file descriptor will use this much memory for buffering. See the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#file-buffering">mount</a> documentation for more details.</p>
<p>Set to <code>0</code> to disable the buffering for the minimum memory usage.</p>
<p>Note that the memory allocation of the buffers is influenced by the <a href="#use-mmap">--use-mmap</a> flag.</p>
<h3 id="cache-dirdir">--cache-dir=DIR</h3>
<p>Specify the directory rclone will use for caching, to override the default.</p>
<p>Default value is depending on operating system: - Windows <code>%LocalAppData%\rclone</code>, if <code>LocalAppData</code> is defined. - macOS <code>$HOME/Library/Caches/rclone</code> if <code>HOME</code> is defined. - Unix <code>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/rclone</code> if <code>XDG_CACHE_HOME</code> is defined, else <code>$HOME/.cache/rclone</code> if <code>HOME</code> is defined. - Fallback (on all OS) to <code>$TMPDIR/rclone</code>, where <code>TMPDIR</code> is the value from <a href="#temp-dir-dir">--temp-dir</a>.</p>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_paths/">config paths</a> command to see the current value.</p>
<p>Cache directory is heavily used by the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#vfs-file-caching">VFS File Caching</a> mount feature, but also by <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/">serve</a>, <a href="/gui">GUI</a> and other parts of rclone.</p>
<h3 id="check-first">--check-first</h3>
<p>If this flag is set then in a <code>sync</code>, <code>copy</code> or <code>move</code>, rclone will do all the checks to see whether files need to be transferred before doing any of the transfers. Normally rclone would start running transfers as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This flag can be useful on IO limited systems where transfers interfere with checking.</p>
<p>It can also be useful to ensure perfect ordering when using <code>--order-by</code>.</p>
<p>If both <code>--check-first</code> and <code>--order-by</code> are set when doing <code>rclone move</code> then rclone will use the transfer thread to delete source files which don't need transferring. This will enable perfect ordering of the transfers and deletes but will cause the transfer stats to have more items in than expected.</p>
<p>Using this flag can use more memory as it effectively sets <code>--max-backlog</code> to infinite. This means that all the info on the objects to transfer is held in memory before the transfers start.</p>
<h3 id="checkersn">--checkers=N</h3>
<p>Originally controlling just the number of file checkers to run in parallel, e.g. by <code>rclone copy</code>. Now a fairly universal parallelism control used by <code>rclone</code> in several places.</p>
<p>Note: checkers do the equality checking of files during a sync. For some storage systems (e.g. S3, Swift, Dropbox) this can take a significant amount of time so they are run in parallel.</p>
<p>The default is to run 8 checkers in parallel. However, in case of slow-reacting backends you may need to lower (rather than increase) this default by setting <code>--checkers</code> to 4 or less threads. This is especially advised if you are experiencing backend server crashes during file checking phase (e.g. on subsequent or top-up backups where little or no file copying is done and checking takes up most of the time). Increase this setting only with utmost care, while monitoring your server health and file checking throughput.</p>
<h3 id="c---checksum">-c, --checksum</h3>
<p>Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see if they are equal. If you set this flag then rclone will check the file hash and size to determine if files are equal.</p>
<p>This is useful when the remote doesn't support setting modified time and a more accurate sync is desired than just checking the file size.</p>
<p>This is very useful when transferring between remotes which store the same hash type on the object, e.g. Drive and Swift. For details of which remotes support which hash type see the table in the <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/">overview section</a>.</p>
<p>Eg <code>rclone --checksum sync s3:/bucket swift:/bucket</code> would run much quicker than without the <code>--checksum</code> flag.</p>
<p>When using this flag, rclone won't update mtimes of remote files if they are incorrect as it would normally.</p>
<h3 id="color-when">--color WHEN</h3>
<p>Specify when colors (and other ANSI codes) should be added to the output.</p>
<p><code>AUTO</code> (default) only allows ANSI codes when the output is a terminal</p>
<p><code>NEVER</code> never allow ANSI codes</p>
<p><code>ALWAYS</code> always add ANSI codes, regardless of the output format (terminal or file)</p>
<h3 id="compare-destdir">--compare-dest=DIR</h3>
<p>When using <code>sync</code>, <code>copy</code> or <code>move</code> DIR is checked in addition to the destination for files. If a file identical to the source is found that file is NOT copied from source. This is useful to copy just files that have changed since the last backup.</p>
<p>You must use the same remote as the destination of the sync. The compare directory must not overlap the destination directory.</p>
<p>See <code>--copy-dest</code> and <code>--backup-dir</code>.</p>
<h3 id="configconfig_file">--config=CONFIG_FILE</h3>
<p>Specify the location of the rclone configuration file, to override the default. E.g. <code>rclone config --config="rclone.conf"</code>.</p>
<p>The exact default is a bit complex to describe, due to changes introduced through different versions of rclone while preserving backwards compatibility, but in most cases it is as simple as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>%APPDATA%/rclone/rclone.conf</code> on Windows</li>
<li><code>~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf</code> on other</li>
</ul>
<p>The complete logic is as follows: Rclone will look for an existing configuration file in any of the following locations, in priority order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>rclone.conf</code> (in program directory, where rclone executable is)</li>
<li><code>%APPDATA%/rclone/rclone.conf</code> (only on Windows)</li>
<li><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rclone/rclone.conf</code> (on all systems, including Windows)</li>
<li><code>~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf</code> (see below for explanation of ~ symbol)</li>
<li><code>~/.rclone.conf</code></li>
</ol>
<p>If no existing configuration file is found, then a new one will be created in the following location:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows: Location 2 listed above, except in the unlikely event that <code>APPDATA</code> is not defined, then location 4 is used instead.</li>
<li>On Unix: Location 3 if <code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> is defined, else location 4.</li>
<li>Fallback to location 5 (on all OS), when the rclone directory cannot be created, but if also a home directory was not found then path <code>.rclone.conf</code> relative to current working directory will be used as a final resort.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>~</code> symbol in paths above represent the home directory of the current user on any OS, and the value is defined as following:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows: <code>%HOME%</code> if defined, else <code>%USERPROFILE%</code>, or else <code>%HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%</code>.</li>
<li>On Unix: <code>$HOME</code> if defined, else by looking up current user in OS-specific user database (e.g. passwd file), or else use the result from shell command <code>cd &amp;&amp; pwd</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you run <code>rclone config file</code> you will see where the default location is for you. Running <code>rclone config touch</code> will ensure a configuration file exists, creating an empty one in the default location if there is none.</p>
<p>The fact that an existing file <code>rclone.conf</code> in the same directory as the rclone executable is always preferred, means that it is easy to run in "portable" mode by downloading rclone executable to a writable directory and then create an empty file <code>rclone.conf</code> in the same directory.</p>
<p>If the location is set to empty string <code>""</code> or path to a file with name <code>notfound</code>, or the os null device represented by value <code>NUL</code> on Windows and <code>/dev/null</code> on Unix systems, then rclone will keep the configuration file in memory only.</p>
<p>You may see a log message "Config file not found - using defaults" if there is no configuration file. This can be supressed, e.g. if you are using rclone entirely with <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#backend-path-to-dir">on the fly remotes</a>, by using memory-only configuration file or by creating an empty configuration file, as described above.</p>
<p>The file format is basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file#Format">INI</a>: Sections of text, led by a <code>[section]</code> header and followed by <code>key=value</code> entries on separate lines. In rclone each remote is represented by its own section, where the section name defines the name of the remote. Options are specified as the <code>key=value</code> entries, where the key is the option name without the <code>--backend-</code> prefix, in lowercase and with <code>_</code> instead of <code>-</code>. E.g. option <code>--mega-hard-delete</code> corresponds to key <code>hard_delete</code>. Only backend options can be specified. A special, and required, key <code>type</code> identifies the <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/">storage system</a>, where the value is the internal lowercase name as returned by command <code>rclone help backends</code>. Comments are indicated by <code>;</code> or <code>#</code> at the beginning of a line.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>[megaremote]
type = mega
user = you@example.com
pass = PDPcQVVjVtzFY-GTdDFozqBhTdsPg3qH</code></pre>
<p>Note that passwords are in <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/">obscured</a> form. Also, many storage systems uses token-based authentication instead of passwords, and this requires additional steps. It is easier, and safer, to use the interactive command <code>rclone config</code> instead of manually editing the configuration file.</p>
<p>The configuration file will typically contain login information, and should therefore have restricted permissions so that only the current user can read it. Rclone tries to ensure this when it writes the file. You may also choose to <a href="#configuration-encryption">encrypt</a> the file.</p>
<p>When token-based authentication are used, the configuration file must be writable, because rclone needs to update the tokens inside it.</p>
<p>To reduce risk of corrupting an existing configuration file, rclone will not write directly to it when saving changes. Instead it will first write to a new, temporary, file. If a configuration file already existed, it will (on Unix systems) try to mirror its permissions to the new file. Then it will rename the existing file to a temporary name as backup. Next, rclone will rename the new file to the correct name, before finally cleaning up by deleting the backup file.</p>
<p>If the configuration file path used by rclone is a symbolic link, then this will be evaluated and rclone will write to the resolved path, instead of overwriting the symbolic link. Temporary files used in the process (described above) will be written to the same parent directory as that of the resolved configuration file, but if this directory is also a symbolic link it will not be resolved and the temporary files will be written to the location of the directory symbolic link.</p>
<h3 id="contimeouttime">--contimeout=TIME</h3>
<p>Set the connection timeout. This should be in go time format which looks like <code>5s</code> for 5 seconds, <code>10m</code> for 10 minutes, or <code>3h30m</code>.</p>
<p>The connection timeout is the amount of time rclone will wait for a connection to go through to a remote object storage system. It is <code>1m</code> by default.</p>
<h3 id="copy-destdir">--copy-dest=DIR</h3>
<p>When using <code>sync</code>, <code>copy</code> or <code>move</code> DIR is checked in addition to the destination for files. If a file identical to the source is found that file is server-side copied from DIR to the destination. This is useful for incremental backup.</p>
<p>The remote in use must support server-side copy and you must use the same remote as the destination of the sync. The compare directory must not overlap the destination directory.</p>
<p>See <code>--compare-dest</code> and <code>--backup-dir</code>.</p>
<h3 id="dedupe-mode-mode">--dedupe-mode MODE</h3>
<p>Mode to run dedupe command in. One of <code>interactive</code>, <code>skip</code>, <code>first</code>, <code>newest</code>, <code>oldest</code>, <code>rename</code>. The default is <code>interactive</code>.<br />
See the dedupe command for more information as to what these options mean.</p>
<h3 id="default-time-time">--default-time TIME</h3>
<p>If a file or directory does have a modification time rclone can read then rclone will display this fixed time instead.</p>
<p>The default is <code>2000-01-01 00:00:00 UTC</code>. This can be configured in any of the ways shown in <a href="#time-option">the time or duration options</a>.</p>
<p>For example <code>--default-time 2020-06-01</code> to set the default time to the 1st of June 2020 or <code>--default-time 0s</code> to set the default time to the time rclone started up.</p>
<h3 id="disable-featurefeature...">--disable FEATURE,FEATURE,...</h3>
<p>This disables a comma separated list of optional features. For example to disable server-side move and server-side copy use:</p>
<pre><code>--disable move,copy</code></pre>
<p>The features can be put in any case.</p>
<p>To see a list of which features can be disabled use:</p>
<pre><code>--disable help</code></pre>
<p>The features a remote has can be seen in JSON format with:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend features remote:</code></pre>
<p>See the overview <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#features">features</a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">optional features</a> to get an idea of which feature does what.</p>
<p>Note that some features can be set to <code>true</code> if they are <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> feature flag features by prefixing them with <code>!</code>. For example the <code>CaseInsensitive</code> feature can be forced to <code>false</code> with <code>--disable CaseInsensitive</code> and forced to <code>true</code> with <code>--disable '!CaseInsensitive'</code>. In general it isn't a good idea doing this but it may be useful in extremis.</p>
<p>(Note that <code>!</code> is a shell command which you will need to escape with single quotes or a backslash on unix like platforms.)</p>
<p>This flag can be useful for debugging and in exceptional circumstances (e.g. Google Drive limiting the total volume of Server Side Copies to 100 GiB/day).</p>
<h3 id="disable-http2">--disable-http2</h3>
<p>This stops rclone from trying to use HTTP/2 if available. This can sometimes speed up transfers due to a <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37373">problem in the Go standard library</a>.</p>
<h3 id="dscp-value">--dscp VALUE</h3>
<p>Specify a DSCP value or name to use in connections. This could help QoS system to identify traffic class. BE, EF, DF, LE, CSx and AFxx are allowed.</p>
<p>See the description of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_services">differentiated services</a> to get an idea of this field. Setting this to 1 (LE) to identify the flow to SCAVENGER class can avoid occupying too much bandwidth in a network with DiffServ support (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8622">RFC 8622</a>).</p>
<p>For example, if you configured QoS on router to handle LE properly. Running:</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy --dscp LE from:/from to:/to</code></pre>
<p>would make the priority lower than usual internet flows.</p>
<p>This option has no effect on Windows (see <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42728">golang/go#42728</a>).</p>
<h3 id="n---dry-run">-n, --dry-run</h3>
<p>Do a trial run with no permanent changes. Use this to see what rclone would do without actually doing it. Useful when setting up the <code>sync</code> command which deletes files in the destination.</p>
<h3 id="expect-continue-timeouttime">--expect-continue-timeout=TIME</h3>
<p>This specifies the amount of time to wait for a server's first response headers after fully writing the request headers if the request has an "Expect: 100-continue" header. Not all backends support using this.</p>
<p>Zero means no timeout and causes the body to be sent immediately, without waiting for the server to approve. This time does not include the time to send the request header.</p>
<p>The default is <code>1s</code>. Set to <code>0</code> to disable.</p>
<h3 id="error-on-no-transfer">--error-on-no-transfer</h3>
<p>By default, rclone will exit with return code 0 if there were no errors.</p>
<p>This option allows rclone to return exit code 9 if no files were transferred between the source and destination. This allows using rclone in scripts, and triggering follow-on actions if data was copied, or skipping if not.</p>
<p>NB: Enabling this option turns a usually non-fatal error into a potentially fatal one - please check and adjust your scripts accordingly!</p>
<h3 id="fix-case">--fix-case</h3>
<p>Normally, a sync to a case insensitive dest (such as macOS / Windows) will not result in a matching filename if the source and dest filenames have casing differences but are otherwise identical. For example, syncing <code>hello.txt</code> to <code>HELLO.txt</code> will normally result in the dest filename remaining <code>HELLO.txt</code>. If <code>--fix-case</code> is set, then <code>HELLO.txt</code> will be renamed to <code>hello.txt</code> to match the source.</p>
<p>NB: - directory names with incorrect casing will also be fixed - <code>--fix-case</code> will be ignored if <code>--immutable</code> is set - using <code>--local-case-sensitive</code> instead is not advisable; it will cause <code>HELLO.txt</code> to get deleted! - the old dest filename must not be excluded by filters. Be especially careful with <a href="https://rclone.org/filtering/#files-from-read-list-of-source-file-names"><code>--files-from</code></a>, which does not respect <a href="https://rclone.org/filtering/#ignore-case-make-searches-case-insensitive"><code>--ignore-case</code></a>! - on remotes that do not support server-side move, <code>--fix-case</code> will require downloading the file and re-uploading it. To avoid this, do not use <code>--fix-case</code>.</p>
<h3 id="fs-cache-expire-durationtime">--fs-cache-expire-duration=TIME</h3>
<p>When using rclone via the API rclone caches created remotes for 5 minutes by default in the "fs cache". This means that if you do repeated actions on the same remote then rclone won't have to build it again from scratch, which makes it more efficient.</p>
<p>This flag sets the time that the remotes are cached for. If you set it to <code>0</code> (or negative) then rclone won't cache the remotes at all.</p>
<p>Note that if you use some flags, eg <code>--backup-dir</code> and if this is set to <code>0</code> rclone may build two remotes (one for the source or destination and one for the <code>--backup-dir</code> where it may have only built one before.</p>
<h3 id="fs-cache-expire-intervaltime">--fs-cache-expire-interval=TIME</h3>
<p>This controls how often rclone checks for cached remotes to expire. See the <code>--fs-cache-expire-duration</code> documentation above for more info. The default is 60s, set to 0 to disable expiry.</p>
<h3 id="header">--header</h3>
<p>Add an HTTP header for all transactions. The flag can be repeated to add multiple headers.</p>
<p>If you want to add headers only for uploads use <code>--header-upload</code> and if you want to add headers only for downloads use <code>--header-download</code>.</p>
<p>This flag is supported for all HTTP based backends even those not supported by <code>--header-upload</code> and <code>--header-download</code> so may be used as a workaround for those with care.</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:test --header &quot;X-Rclone: Foo&quot; --header &quot;X-LetMeIn: Yes&quot;</code></pre>
<h3 id="header-download">--header-download</h3>
<p>Add an HTTP header for all download transactions. The flag can be repeated to add multiple headers.</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive s3:test/src ~/dst --header-download &quot;X-Amz-Meta-Test: Foo&quot; --header-download &quot;X-Amz-Meta-Test2: Bar&quot;</code></pre>
<p>See the GitHub issue <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/59">here</a> for currently supported backends.</p>
<h3 id="header-upload">--header-upload</h3>
<p>Add an HTTP header for all upload transactions. The flag can be repeated to add multiple headers.</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive ~/src s3:test/dst --header-upload &quot;Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=&#39;cool.html&#39;&quot; --header-upload &quot;X-Amz-Meta-Test: FooBar&quot;</code></pre>
<p>See the GitHub issue <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/59">here</a> for currently supported backends.</p>
<h3 id="human-readable">--human-readable</h3>
<p>Rclone commands output values for sizes (e.g. number of bytes) and counts (e.g. number of files) either as <em>raw</em> numbers, or in <em>human-readable</em> format.</p>
<p>In human-readable format the values are scaled to larger units, indicated with a suffix shown after the value, and rounded to three decimals. Rclone consistently uses binary units (powers of 2) for sizes and decimal units (powers of 10) for counts. The unit prefix for size is according to IEC standard notation, e.g. <code>Ki</code> for kibi. Used with byte unit, <code>1 KiB</code> means 1024 Byte. In list type of output, only the unit prefix appended to the value (e.g. <code>9.762Ki</code>), while in more textual output the full unit is shown (e.g. <code>9.762 KiB</code>). For counts the SI standard notation is used, e.g. prefix <code>k</code> for kilo. Used with file counts, <code>1k</code> means 1000 files.</p>
<p>The various <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_ls/">list</a> commands output raw numbers by default. Option <code>--human-readable</code> will make them output values in human-readable format instead (with the short unit prefix).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/">about</a> command outputs human-readable by default, with a command-specific option <code>--full</code> to output the raw numbers instead.</p>
<p>Command <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_size/">size</a> outputs both human-readable and raw numbers in the same output.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_tree/">tree</a> command also considers <code>--human-readable</code>, but it will not use the exact same notation as the other commands: It rounds to one decimal, and uses single letter suffix, e.g. <code>K</code> instead of <code>Ki</code>. The reason for this is that it relies on an external library.</p>
<p>The interactive command <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_ncdu/">ncdu</a> shows human-readable by default, and responds to key <code>u</code> for toggling human-readable format.</p>
<h3 id="ignore-case-sync">--ignore-case-sync</h3>
<p>Using this option will cause rclone to ignore the case of the files when synchronizing so files will not be copied/synced when the existing filenames are the same, even if the casing is different.</p>
<h3 id="ignore-checksum">--ignore-checksum</h3>
<p>Normally rclone will check that the checksums of transferred files match, and give an error "corrupted on transfer" if they don't.</p>
<p>You can use this option to skip that check. You should only use it if you have had the "corrupted on transfer" error message and you are sure you might want to transfer potentially corrupted data.</p>
<h3 id="ignore-existing">--ignore-existing</h3>
<p>Using this option will make rclone unconditionally skip all files that exist on the destination, no matter the content of these files.</p>
<p>While this isn't a generally recommended option, it can be useful in cases where your files change due to encryption. However, it cannot correct partial transfers in case a transfer was interrupted.</p>
<p>When performing a <code>move</code>/<code>moveto</code> command, this flag will leave skipped files in the source location unchanged when a file with the same name exists on the destination.</p>
<h3 id="ignore-size">--ignore-size</h3>
<p>Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see if they are equal. If you set this flag then rclone will check only the modification time. If <code>--checksum</code> is set then it only checks the checksum.</p>
<p>It will also cause rclone to skip verifying the sizes are the same after transfer.</p>
<p>This can be useful for transferring files to and from OneDrive which occasionally misreports the size of image files (see <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/399">#399</a> for more info).</p>
<h3 id="i---ignore-times">-I, --ignore-times</h3>
<p>Using this option will cause rclone to unconditionally upload all files regardless of the state of files on the destination.</p>
<p>Normally rclone would skip any files that have the same modification time and are the same size (or have the same checksum if using <code>--checksum</code>).</p>
<h3 id="immutable">--immutable</h3>
<p>Treat source and destination files as immutable and disallow modification.</p>
<p>With this option set, files will be created and deleted as requested, but existing files will never be updated. If an existing file does not match between the source and destination, rclone will give the error <code>Source and destination exist but do not match: immutable file modified</code>.</p>
<p>Note that only commands which transfer files (e.g. <code>sync</code>, <code>copy</code>, <code>move</code>) are affected by this behavior, and only modification is disallowed. Files may still be deleted explicitly (e.g. <code>delete</code>, <code>purge</code>) or implicitly (e.g. <code>sync</code>, <code>move</code>). Use <code>copy --immutable</code> if it is desired to avoid deletion as well as modification.</p>
<p>This can be useful as an additional layer of protection for immutable or append-only data sets (notably backup archives), where modification implies corruption and should not be propagated.</p>
<h3 id="inplace">--inplace</h3>
<p>The <code>--inplace</code> flag changes the behaviour of rclone when uploading files to some backends (backends with the <code>PartialUploads</code> feature flag set) such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>local</li>
<li>ftp</li>
<li>sftp</li>
<li>pcloud</li>
</ul>
<p>Without <code>--inplace</code> (the default) rclone will first upload to a temporary file with an extension like this, where <code>XXXXXX</code> represents a hash of the source file's fingerprint and <code>.partial</code> is <a href="#partial-suffix">--partial-suffix</a> value (<code>.partial</code> by default).</p>
<pre><code>original-file-name.XXXXXX.partial</code></pre>
<p>(rclone will make sure the final name is no longer than 100 characters by truncating the <code>original-file-name</code> part if necessary).</p>
<p>When the upload is complete, rclone will rename the <code>.partial</code> file to the correct name, overwriting any existing file at that point. If the upload fails then the <code>.partial</code> file will be deleted.</p>
<p>This prevents other users of the backend from seeing partially uploaded files in their new names and prevents overwriting the old file until the new one is completely uploaded.</p>
<p>If the <code>--inplace</code> flag is supplied, rclone will upload directly to the final name without creating a <code>.partial</code> file.</p>
<p>This means that an incomplete file will be visible in the directory listings while the upload is in progress and any existing files will be overwritten as soon as the upload starts. If the transfer fails then the file will be deleted. This can cause data loss of the existing file if the transfer fails.</p>
<p>Note that on the local file system if you don't use <code>--inplace</code> hard links (Unix only) will be broken. And if you do use <code>--inplace</code> you won't be able to update in use executables.</p>
<p>Note also that versions of rclone prior to v1.63.0 behave as if the <code>--inplace</code> flag is always supplied.</p>
<h3 id="interactive">-i, --interactive</h3>
<p>This flag can be used to tell rclone that you wish a manual confirmation before destructive operations.</p>
<p>It is <strong>recommended</strong> that you use this flag while learning rclone especially with <code>rclone sync</code>.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone delete --interactive /tmp/dir
rclone: delete &quot;important-file.txt&quot;?
y) Yes, this is OK (default)
n) No, skip this
s) Skip all delete operations with no more questions
!) Do all delete operations with no more questions
q) Exit rclone now.
y/n/s/!/q&gt; n</code></pre>
<p>The options mean</p>
<ul>
<li><code>y</code>: <strong>Yes</strong>, this operation should go ahead. You can also press Return for this to happen. You'll be asked every time unless you choose <code>s</code> or <code>!</code>.</li>
<li><code>n</code>: <strong>No</strong>, do not do this operation. You'll be asked every time unless you choose <code>s</code> or <code>!</code>.</li>
<li><code>s</code>: <strong>Skip</strong> all the following operations of this type with no more questions. This takes effect until rclone exits. If there are any different kind of operations you'll be prompted for them.</li>
<li><code>!</code>: <strong>Do all</strong> the following operations with no more questions. Useful if you've decided that you don't mind rclone doing that kind of operation. This takes effect until rclone exits . If there are any different kind of operations you'll be prompted for them.</li>
<li><code>q</code>: <strong>Quit</strong> rclone now, just in case!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="leave-root">--leave-root</h3>
<p>During rmdirs it will not remove root directory, even if it's empty.</p>
<h3 id="links--l">--links / -l</h3>
<p>Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave like symlinks under Windows).</p>
<p>If you supply this flag then rclone will copy symbolic links from any supported backend backend, and store them as text files, with a <code>.rclonelink</code> suffix in the destination.</p>
<p>The text file will contain the target of the symbolic link.</p>
<p>The <code>--links</code> / <code>-l</code> flag enables this feature for all supported backends and the VFS. There are individual flags for just enabling it for the VFS <code>--vfs-links</code> and the local backend <code>--local-links</code> if required.</p>
<h3 id="list-cutoff">--list-cutoff N</h3>
<p>When syncing rclone needs to sort directory entries before comparing them. Below this threshold (1,000,000) by default, rclone will store the directory entries in memory. 1,000,000 entries will take approx 1GB of RAM to store. Above this threshold rclone will store directory entries on disk and sort them without using a lot of memory.</p>
<p>Doing this is slightly less efficient then sorting them in memory and will only work well for the bucket based backends (eg s3, b2, azureblob, swift) but these are the only backends likely to have millions of entries in a directory.</p>
<h3 id="log-filefile">--log-file=FILE</h3>
<p>Log all of rclone's output to FILE. This is not active by default. This can be useful for tracking down problems with syncs in combination with the <code>-v</code> flag. See the <a href="#logging">Logging section</a> for more info.</p>
<p>If FILE exists then rclone will append to it.</p>
<p>Note that if you are using the <code>logrotate</code> program to manage rclone's logs, then you should use the <code>copytruncate</code> option as rclone doesn't have a signal to rotate logs.</p>
<h3 id="log-format-list">--log-format LIST</h3>
<p>Comma separated list of log format options. The accepted options are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>date</code> - Add a date in the format YYYY/MM/YY to the log.</li>
<li><code>time</code> - Add a time to the log in format HH:MM:SS.</li>
<li><code>microseconds</code> - Add microseconds to the time in format HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS.</li>
<li><code>UTC</code> - Make the logs in UTC not localtime.</li>
<li><code>longfile</code> - Adds the source file and line number of the log statement.</li>
<li><code>shortfile</code> - Adds the source file and line number of the log statement.</li>
<li><code>pid</code> - Add the process ID to the log - useful with <code>rclone mount --daemon</code>.</li>
<li><code>nolevel</code> - Don't add the level to the log.</li>
<li><code>json</code> - Equivalent to adding <code>--use-json-log</code></li>
</ul>
<p>They are added to the log line in the order above.</p>
<p>The default log format is <code>"date,time"</code>.</p>
<h3 id="log-level-level">--log-level LEVEL</h3>
<p>This sets the log level for rclone. The default log level is <code>NOTICE</code>.</p>
<p><code>DEBUG</code> is equivalent to <code>-vv</code>. It outputs lots of debug info - useful for bug reports and really finding out what rclone is doing.</p>
<p><code>INFO</code> is equivalent to <code>-v</code>. It outputs information about each transfer and prints stats once a minute by default.</p>
<p><code>NOTICE</code> is the default log level if no logging flags are supplied. It outputs very little when things are working normally. It outputs warnings and significant events.</p>
<p><code>ERROR</code> is equivalent to <code>-q</code>. It only outputs error messages.</p>
<h3 id="windows-event-log-level">--windows-event-log LEVEL</h3>
<p>If this is configured (the default is <code>OFF</code>) then logs of this level and above will be logged to the Windows event log in <strong>addition</strong> to the normal logs. These will be logged in JSON format as described below regardless of what format the main logs are configured for.</p>
<p>The Windows event log only has 3 levels of severity <code>Info</code>, <code>Warning</code> and <code>Error</code>. If enabled we map rclone levels like this.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Error</code> ← <code>ERROR</code> (and above)</li>
<li><code>Warning</code> ← <code>WARNING</code> (note that this level is defined but not currently used).</li>
<li><code>Info</code> ← <code>NOTICE</code>, <code>INFO</code> and <code>DEBUG</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rclone will declare its log source as "rclone" if it is has enough permissions to create the registry key needed. If not then logs will appear as "Application". You can run <code>rclone version --windows-event-log DEBUG</code> once as administrator to create the registry key in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that the <code>--windows-event-log</code> level must be greater (more severe) than or equal to the <code>--log-level</code>. For example to log DEBUG to a log file but ERRORs to the event log you would use</p>
<pre><code>--log-file rclone.log --log-level DEBUG --windows-event-log ERROR</code></pre>
<p>This option is only supported Windows platforms.</p>
<h3 id="use-json-log">--use-json-log</h3>
<p>This switches the log format to JSON for rclone. The fields of JSON log are <code>level</code>, <code>msg</code>, <code>source</code>, <code>time</code>. The JSON logs will be printed on a single line, but are shown expanded here for clarity.</p>

<h3 id="low-level-retries-number">--low-level-retries NUMBER</h3>
<p>This controls the number of low level retries rclone does.</p>
<p>A low level retry is used to retry a failing operation - typically one HTTP request. This might be uploading a chunk of a big file for example. You will see low level retries in the log with the <code>-v</code> flag.</p>
<p>This shouldn't need to be changed from the default in normal operations. However, if you get a lot of low level retries you may wish to reduce the value so rclone moves on to a high level retry (see the <code>--retries</code> flag) quicker.</p>
<p>Disable low level retries with <code>--low-level-retries 1</code>.</p>
<h3 id="max-backlogn">--max-backlog=N</h3>
<p>This is the maximum allowable backlog of files in a sync/copy/move queued for being checked or transferred.</p>
<p>This can be set arbitrarily large. It will only use memory when the queue is in use. Note that it will use in the order of N KiB of memory when the backlog is in use.</p>
<p>Setting this large allows rclone to calculate how many files are pending more accurately, give a more accurate estimated finish time and make <code>--order-by</code> work more accurately.</p>
<p>Setting this small will make rclone more synchronous to the listings of the remote which may be desirable.</p>
<p>Setting this to a negative number will make the backlog as large as possible.</p>
<h3 id="max-buffer-memory">--max-buffer-memory=SIZE</h3>
<p>If set, don't allocate more than SIZE amount of memory as buffers. If not set or set to <code>0</code> or <code>off</code> this will not limit the amount of memory in use.</p>
<p>This includes memory used by buffers created by the <code>--buffer</code> flag and buffers used by multi-thread transfers.</p>
<p>Most multi-thread transfers do not take additional memory, but some do depending on the backend (eg the s3 backend for uploads). This means there is a tension between total setting <code>--transfers</code> as high as possible and memory use.</p>
<p>Setting <code>--max-buffer-memory</code> allows the buffer memory to be controlled so that it doesn't overwhelm the machine and allows <code>--transfers</code> to be set large.</p>
<h3 id="max-connectionsn">--max-connections=N</h3>
<p>This sets the maximum number of concurrent calls to the backend API. It may not map 1:1 to TCP or HTTP connections depending on the backend in use and the use of HTTP1 vs HTTP2.</p>
<p>When downloading files, backends only limit the initial opening of the stream. The bulk data download is not counted as a connection. This means that the <code>--max--connections</code> flag won't limit the total number of downloads.</p>
<p>Note that it is possible to cause deadlocks with this setting so it should be used with care.</p>
<p>If you are doing a sync or copy then make sure <code>--max-connections</code> is one more than the sum of <code>--transfers</code> and <code>--checkers</code>.</p>
<p>If you use <code>--check-first</code> then <code>--max-connections</code> just needs to be one more than the maximum of <code>--checkers</code> and <code>--transfers</code>.</p>
<p>So for <code>--max-connections 3</code> you'd use <code>--checkers 2 --transfers 2 --check-first</code> or <code>--checkers 1 --transfers 1</code>.</p>
<p>Setting this flag can be useful for backends which do multipart uploads to limit the number of simultaneous parts being transferred.</p>
<h3 id="max-deleten">--max-delete=N</h3>
<p>This tells rclone not to delete more than N files. If that limit is exceeded then a fatal error will be generated and rclone will stop the operation in progress.</p>
<h3 id="max-delete-sizesize">--max-delete-size=SIZE</h3>
<p>Rclone will stop deleting files when the total size of deletions has reached the size specified. It defaults to off.</p>
<p>If that limit is exceeded then a fatal error will be generated and rclone will stop the operation in progress.</p>
<h3 id="max-depthn">--max-depth=N</h3>
<p>This modifies the recursion depth for all the commands except purge.</p>
<p>So if you do <code>rclone --max-depth 1 ls remote:path</code> you will see only the files in the top level directory. Using <code>--max-depth 2</code> means you will see all the files in first two directory levels and so on.</p>
<p>For historical reasons the <code>lsd</code> command defaults to using a <code>--max-depth</code> of 1 - you can override this with the command line flag.</p>
<p>You can use this command to disable recursion (with <code>--max-depth 1</code>).</p>
<p>Note that if you use this with <code>sync</code> and <code>--delete-excluded</code> the files not recursed through are considered excluded and will be deleted on the destination. Test first with <code>--dry-run</code> if you are not sure what will happen.</p>
<h3 id="max-durationtime">--max-duration=TIME</h3>
<p>Rclone will stop transferring when it has run for the duration specified. Defaults to off.</p>
<p>When the limit is reached all transfers will stop immediately. Use <code>--cutoff-mode</code> to modify this behaviour.</p>
<p>Rclone will exit with exit code 10 if the duration limit is reached.</p>
<h3 id="max-transfersize">--max-transfer=SIZE</h3>
<p>Rclone will stop transferring when it has reached the size specified. Defaults to off.</p>
<p>When the limit is reached all transfers will stop immediately. Use <code>--cutoff-mode</code> to modify this behaviour.</p>
<p>Rclone will exit with exit code 8 if the transfer limit is reached.</p>
<h3 id="cutoff-modehardsoftcautious">--cutoff-mode=hard|soft|cautious</h3>
<p>This modifies the behavior of <code>--max-transfer</code> and <code>--max-duration</code> Defaults to <code>--cutoff-mode=hard</code>.</p>
<p>Specifying <code>--cutoff-mode=hard</code> will stop transferring immediately when Rclone reaches the limit.</p>
<p>Specifying <code>--cutoff-mode=soft</code> will stop starting new transfers when Rclone reaches the limit.</p>
<p>Specifying <code>--cutoff-mode=cautious</code> will try to prevent Rclone from reaching the limit. Only applicable for <code>--max-transfer</code></p>
<h2 id="m---metadata">-M, --metadata</h2>
<p>Setting this flag enables rclone to copy the metadata from the source to the destination. For local backends this is ownership, permissions, xattr etc. See the <a href="#metadata">metadata section</a> for more info.</p>
<h3 id="metadata-mapper">--metadata-mapper SpaceSepList</h3>
<p>If you supply the parameter <code>--metadata-mapper /path/to/program</code> then rclone will use that program to map metadata from source object to destination object.</p>
<p>The argument to this flag should be a command with an optional space separated list of arguments. If one of the arguments has a space in then enclose it in <code>"</code>, if you want a literal <code>"</code> in an argument then enclose the argument in <code>"</code> and double the <code>"</code>. See <a href="https://godoc.org/encoding/csv">CSV encoding</a> for more info.</p>
<pre><code>--metadata-mapper &quot;python bin/test_metadata_mapper.py&quot;
--metadata-mapper &#39;python bin/test_metadata_mapper.py &quot;argument with a space&quot;&#39;
--metadata-mapper &#39;python bin/test_metadata_mapper.py &quot;argument with &quot;&quot;two&quot;&quot; quotes&quot;&#39;</code></pre>
<p>This uses a simple JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT. This will be called for every file and directory copied and may be called concurrently.</p>
<p>The program's job is to take a metadata blob on the input and turn it into a metadata blob on the output suitable for the destination backend.</p>
<p>Input to the program (via STDIN) might look like this. This provides some context for the <code>Metadata</code> which may be important.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SrcFs</code> is the config string for the remote that the object is currently on.</li>
<li><code>SrcFsType</code> is the name of the source backend.</li>
<li><code>DstFs</code> is the config string for the remote that the object is being copied to</li>
<li><code>DstFsType</code> is the name of the destination backend.</li>
<li><code>Remote</code> is the path of the object relative to the root.</li>
<li><code>Size</code>, <code>MimeType</code>, <code>ModTime</code> are attributes of the object.</li>
<li><code>IsDir</code> is <code>true</code> if this is a directory (not yet implemented).</li>
<li><code>ID</code> is the source <code>ID</code> of the object if known.</li>
<li><code>Metadata</code> is the backend specific metadata as described in the backend docs.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find this example (slightly expanded) in the rclone source code at <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/bin/test_metadata_mapper.py">bin/test_metadata_mapper.py</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to see the input to the metadata mapper and the output returned from it in the log you can use <code>-vv --dump mapper</code>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#metadata">metadata section</a> for more info.</p>
<h3 id="metadata-set-keyvalue">--metadata-set key=value</h3>
<p>Add metadata <code>key</code> = <code>value</code> when uploading. This can be repeated as many times as required. See the <a href="#metadata">metadata section</a> for more info.</p>
<h3 id="modify-windowtime">--modify-window=TIME</h3>
<p>When checking whether a file has been modified, this is the maximum allowed time difference that a file can have and still be considered equivalent.</p>
<p>The default is <code>1ns</code> unless this is overridden by a remote. For example OS X only stores modification times to the nearest second so if you are reading and writing to an OS X filing system this will be <code>1s</code> by default.</p>
<p>This command line flag allows you to override that computed default.</p>
<h3 id="multi-thread-write-buffer-sizesize">--multi-thread-write-buffer-size=SIZE</h3>
<p>When transferring with multiple threads, rclone will buffer SIZE bytes in memory before writing to disk for each thread.</p>
<p>This can improve performance if the underlying filesystem does not deal well with a lot of small writes in different positions of the file, so if you see transfers being limited by disk write speed, you might want to experiment with different values. Specially for magnetic drives and remote file systems a higher value can be useful.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the default of <code>128k</code> should be fine for almost all use cases, so before changing it ensure that network is not really your bottleneck.</p>
<p>As a final hint, size is not the only factor: block size (or similar concept) can have an impact. In one case, we observed that exact multiples of 16k performed much better than other values.</p>
<h3 id="multi-thread-chunk-sizesizesuffix">--multi-thread-chunk-size=SizeSuffix</h3>
<p>Normally the chunk size for multi thread transfers is set by the backend. However some backends such as <code>local</code> and <code>smb</code> (which implement <code>OpenWriterAt</code> but not <code>OpenChunkWriter</code>) don't have a natural chunk size.</p>
<p>In this case the value of this option is used (default 64Mi).</p>
<h3 id="multi-thread-cutoff">--multi-thread-cutoff=SIZE</h3>
<p>When transferring files above SIZE to capable backends, rclone will use multiple threads to transfer the file (default 256M).</p>
<p>Capable backends are marked in the <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">overview</a> as <code>MultithreadUpload</code>. (They need to implement either the <code>OpenWriterAt</code> or <code>OpenChunkWriter</code> internal interfaces). These include include, <code>local</code>, <code>s3</code>, <code>azureblob</code>, <code>b2</code>, <code>oracleobjectstorage</code> and <code>smb</code> at the time of writing.</p>
<p>On the local disk, rclone preallocates the file (using <code>fallocate(FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE)</code> on unix or <code>NTSetInformationFile</code> on Windows both of which takes no time) then each thread writes directly into the file at the correct place. This means that rclone won't create fragmented or sparse files and there won't be any assembly time at the end of the transfer.</p>
<p>The number of threads used to transfer is controlled by <code>--multi-thread-streams</code>.</p>
<p>Use <code>-vv</code> if you wish to see info about the threads.</p>
<p>This will work with the <code>sync</code>/<code>copy</code>/<code>move</code> commands and friends <code>copyto</code>/<code>moveto</code>. Multi thread transfers will be used with <code>rclone mount</code> and <code>rclone serve</code> if <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> is set to <code>writes</code> or above.</p>
<p>Most multi-thread transfers do not take additional memory, but some do (for example uploading to s3). In the worst case memory usage can be at maximum <code>--transfers</code> * <code>--multi-thread-chunk-size</code> <em> <code>--multi-thread-streams</code> or specifically for the s3 backend <code>--transfers</code> </em> <code>--s3-chunk-size</code> * <code>--s3-concurrency</code>. However you can use the the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#max-buffer-memory">--max-buffer-memory</a> flag to control the maximum memory used here.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> that this <strong>only</strong> works with supported backends as the destination but will work with any backend as the source.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> that multi-thread copies are disabled for local to local copies as they are faster without unless <code>--multi-thread-streams</code> is set explicitly.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> on Windows using multi-thread transfers to the local disk will cause the resulting files to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file">sparse</a>. Use <code>--local-no-sparse</code> to disable sparse files (which may cause long delays at the start of transfers) or disable multi-thread transfers with <code>--multi-thread-streams 0</code></p>
<h3 id="multi-thread-streamsn">--multi-thread-streams=N</h3>
<p>When using multi thread transfers (see above <code>--multi-thread-cutoff</code>) this sets the number of streams to use. Set to <code>0</code> to disable multi thread transfers (Default 4).</p>
<p>If the backend has a <code>--backend-upload-concurrency</code> setting (eg <code>--s3-upload-concurrency</code>) then this setting will be used as the number of transfers instead if it is larger than the value of <code>--multi-thread-streams</code> or <code>--multi-thread-streams</code> isn't set.</p>
<h3 id="name-transform-commandxxxx">--name-transform COMMAND[=XXXX]</h3>
<p><code>--name-transform</code> introduces path name transformations for <code>rclone copy</code>, <code>rclone sync</code>, and <code>rclone move</code>. These transformations enable modifications to source and destination file names by applying prefixes, suffixes, and other alterations during transfer operations. For detailed docs and examples, see <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_convmv/"><code>convmv</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="no-check-dest">--no-check-dest</h3>
<p>The <code>--no-check-dest</code> can be used with <code>move</code> or <code>copy</code> and it causes rclone not to check the destination at all when copying files.</p>
<p>This means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the destination is not listed minimising the API calls</li>
<li>files are always transferred</li>
<li>this can cause duplicates on remotes which allow it (e.g. Google Drive)</li>
<li><code>--retries 1</code> is recommended otherwise you'll transfer everything again on a retry</li>
</ul>
<p>This flag is useful to minimise the transactions if you know that none of the files are on the destination.</p>
<p>This is a specialized flag which should be ignored by most users!</p>
<h3 id="no-gzip-encoding">--no-gzip-encoding</h3>
<p>Don't set <code>Accept-Encoding: gzip</code>. This means that rclone won't ask the server for compressed files automatically. Useful if you've set the server to return files with <code>Content-Encoding: gzip</code> but you uploaded compressed files.</p>
<p>There is no need to set this in normal operation, and doing so will decrease the network transfer efficiency of rclone.</p>
<h3 id="no-traverse">--no-traverse</h3>
<p>The <code>--no-traverse</code> flag controls whether the destination file system is traversed when using the <code>copy</code> or <code>move</code> commands. <code>--no-traverse</code> is not compatible with <code>sync</code> and will be ignored if you supply it with <code>sync</code>.</p>
<p>If you are only copying a small number of files (or are filtering most of the files) and/or have a large number of files on the destination then <code>--no-traverse</code> will stop rclone listing the destination and save time.</p>
<p>However, if you are copying a large number of files, especially if you are doing a copy where lots of the files under consideration haven't changed and won't need copying then you shouldn't use <code>--no-traverse</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/">rclone copy</a> for an example of how to use it.</p>
<h3 id="no-unicode-normalization">--no-unicode-normalization</h3>
<p>Don't normalize unicode characters in filenames during the sync routine.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an operating system will store filenames containing unicode parts in their decomposed form (particularly macOS). Some cloud storage systems will then recompose the unicode, resulting in duplicate files if the data is ever copied back to a local filesystem.</p>
<p>Using this flag will disable that functionality, treating each unicode character as unique. For example, by default é and é will be normalized into the same character. With <code>--no-unicode-normalization</code> they will be treated as unique characters.</p>
<h3 id="no-update-modtime">--no-update-modtime</h3>
<p>When using this flag, rclone won't update modification times of remote files if they are incorrect as it would normally.</p>
<p>This can be used if the remote is being synced with another tool also (e.g. the Google Drive client).</p>
<h3 id="no-update-dir-modtime">--no-update-dir-modtime</h3>
<p>When using this flag, rclone won't update modification times of remote directories if they are incorrect as it would normally.</p>
<h3 id="order-by-string">--order-by string</h3>
<p>The <code>--order-by</code> flag controls the order in which files in the backlog are processed in <code>rclone sync</code>, <code>rclone copy</code> and <code>rclone move</code>.</p>
<p>The order by string is constructed like this. The first part describes what aspect is being measured:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>size</code> - order by the size of the files</li>
<li><code>name</code> - order by the full path of the files</li>
<li><code>modtime</code> - order by the modification date of the files</li>
</ul>
<p>This can have a modifier appended with a comma:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ascending</code> or <code>asc</code> - order so that the smallest (or oldest) is processed first</li>
<li><code>descending</code> or <code>desc</code> - order so that the largest (or newest) is processed first</li>
<li><code>mixed</code> - order so that the smallest is processed first for some threads and the largest for others</li>
</ul>
<p>If the modifier is <code>mixed</code> then it can have an optional percentage (which defaults to <code>50</code>), e.g. <code>size,mixed,25</code> which means that 25% of the threads should be taking the smallest items and 75% the largest. The threads which take the smallest first will always take the smallest first and likewise the largest first threads. The <code>mixed</code> mode can be useful to minimise the transfer time when you are transferring a mixture of large and small files - the large files are guaranteed upload threads and bandwidth and the small files will be processed continuously.</p>
<p>If no modifier is supplied then the order is <code>ascending</code>.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--order-by size,desc</code> - send the largest files first</li>
<li><code>--order-by modtime,ascending</code> - send the oldest files first</li>
<li><code>--order-by name</code> - send the files with alphabetically by path first</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>--order-by</code> flag is not supplied or it is supplied with an empty string then the default ordering will be used which is as scanned. With <code>--checkers 1</code> this is mostly alphabetical, however with the default <code>--checkers 8</code> it is somewhat random.</p>
<h4 id="limitations-3">Limitations</h4>
<p>The <code>--order-by</code> flag does not do a separate pass over the data. This means that it may transfer some files out of the order specified if</p>
<ul>
<li>there are no files in the backlog or the source has not been fully scanned yet</li>
<li>there are more than <a href="#max-backlog-n">--max-backlog</a> files in the backlog</li>
</ul>
<p>Rclone will do its best to transfer the best file it has so in practice this should not cause a problem. Think of <code>--order-by</code> as being more of a best efforts flag rather than a perfect ordering.</p>
<p>If you want perfect ordering then you will need to specify <a href="#check-first">--check-first</a> which will find all the files which need transferring first before transferring any.</p>
<h3 id="partial-suffix">--partial-suffix</h3>
<p>When <a href="#inplace">--inplace</a> is not used, it causes rclone to use the <code>--partial-suffix</code> as suffix for temporary files.</p>
<p>Suffix length limit is 16 characters.</p>
<p>The default is <code>.partial</code>.</p>
<h3 id="password-command">--password-command SpaceSepList</h3>
<p>This flag supplies a program which should supply the config password when run. This is an alternative to rclone prompting for the password or setting the <code>RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS</code> variable. It is also used when setting the config password for the first time.</p>
<p>The argument to this should be a command with a space separated list of arguments. If one of the arguments has a space in then enclose it in <code>"</code>, if you want a literal <code>"</code> in an argument then enclose the argument in <code>"</code> and double the <code>"</code>. See <a href="https://godoc.org/encoding/csv">CSV encoding</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Eg</p>
<pre><code>--password-command &quot;echo hello&quot;
--password-command &#39;echo &quot;hello with space&quot;&#39;
--password-command &#39;echo &quot;hello with &quot;&quot;quotes&quot;&quot; and space&quot;&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Note that when changing the configuration password the environment variable <code>RCLONE_PASSWORD_CHANGE=1</code> will be set. This can be used to distinguish initial decryption of the config file from the new password.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#configuration-encryption">Configuration Encryption</a> for more info.</p>
<p>See a <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/wiki/Windows-Powershell-use-rclone-password-command-for-Config-file-password">Windows PowerShell example on the Wiki</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p---progress">-P, --progress</h3>
<p>This flag makes rclone update the stats in a static block in the terminal providing a realtime overview of the transfer.</p>
<p>Any log messages will scroll above the static block. Log messages will push the static block down to the bottom of the terminal where it will stay.</p>
<p>Normally this is updated every 500mS but this period can be overridden with the <code>--stats</code> flag.</p>
<p>This can be used with the <code>--stats-one-line</code> flag for a simpler display.</p>
<p>To change the display length of filenames (for different terminal widths), see the <code>--stats-file-name-length</code> option. The default output is formatted for 80 character wide terminals.</p>
<p>Note: On Windows until <a href="https://github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm/issues/26">this bug</a> is fixed all non-ASCII characters will be replaced with <code>.</code> when <code>--progress</code> is in use.</p>
<h3 id="progress-terminal-title">--progress-terminal-title</h3>
<p>This flag, when used with <code>-P/--progress</code>, will print the string <code>ETA: %s</code> to the terminal title.</p>
<h3 id="q---quiet">-q, --quiet</h3>
<p>This flag will limit rclone's output to error messages only.</p>
<h3 id="refresh-times">--refresh-times</h3>
<p>The <code>--refresh-times</code> flag can be used to update modification times of existing files when they are out of sync on backends which don't support hashes.</p>
<p>This is useful if you uploaded files with the incorrect timestamps and you now wish to correct them.</p>
<p>This flag is <strong>only</strong> useful for destinations which don't support hashes (e.g. <code>crypt</code>).</p>
<p>This can be used any of the sync commands <code>sync</code>, <code>copy</code> or <code>move</code>.</p>
<p>To use this flag you will need to be doing a modification time sync (so not using <code>--size-only</code> or <code>--checksum</code>). The flag will have no effect when using <code>--size-only</code> or <code>--checksum</code>.</p>
<p>If this flag is used when rclone comes to upload a file it will check to see if there is an existing file on the destination. If this file matches the source with size (and checksum if available) but has a differing timestamp then instead of re-uploading it, rclone will update the timestamp on the destination file. If the checksum does not match rclone will upload the new file. If the checksum is absent (e.g. on a <code>crypt</code> backend) then rclone will update the timestamp.</p>
<p>Note that some remotes can't set the modification time without re-uploading the file so this flag is less useful on them.</p>
<p>Normally if you are doing a modification time sync rclone will update modification times without <code>--refresh-times</code> provided that the remote supports checksums <strong>and</strong> the checksums match on the file. However if the checksums are absent then rclone will upload the file rather than setting the timestamp as this is the safe behaviour.</p>
<h3 id="retries-int">--retries int</h3>
<p>Retry the entire sync if it fails this many times it fails (default 3).</p>
<p>Some remotes can be unreliable and a few retries help pick up the files which didn't get transferred because of errors.</p>
<p>Disable retries with <code>--retries 1</code>.</p>
<h3 id="retries-sleeptime">--retries-sleep=TIME</h3>
<p>This sets the interval between each retry specified by <code>--retries</code></p>
<p>The default is <code>0</code>. Use <code>0</code> to disable.</p>
<h3 id="server-side-across-configs">--server-side-across-configs</h3>
<p>Allow server-side operations (e.g. copy or move) to work across different configurations.</p>
<p>This can be useful if you wish to do a server-side copy or move between two remotes which use the same backend but are configured differently.</p>
<p>Note that this isn't enabled by default because it isn't easy for rclone to tell if it will work between any two configurations.</p>
<h3 id="size-only">--size-only</h3>
<p>Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see if they are equal. If you set this flag then rclone will check only the size.</p>
<p>This can be useful transferring files from Dropbox which have been modified by the desktop sync client which doesn't set checksums of modification times in the same way as rclone.</p>
<h3 id="statstime">--stats=TIME</h3>
<p>Commands which transfer data (<code>sync</code>, <code>copy</code>, <code>copyto</code>, <code>move</code>, <code>moveto</code>) will print data transfer stats at regular intervals to show their progress.</p>
<p>This sets the interval.</p>
<p>The default is <code>1m</code>. Use <code>0</code> to disable.</p>
<p>If you set the stats interval then all commands can show stats. This can be useful when running other commands, <code>check</code> or <code>mount</code> for example.</p>
<p>Stats are logged at <code>INFO</code> level by default which means they won't show at default log level <code>NOTICE</code>. Use <code>--stats-log-level NOTICE</code> or <code>-v</code> to make them show. See the <a href="#logging">Logging section</a> for more info on log levels.</p>
<p>Note that on macOS you can send a SIGINFO (which is normally ctrl-T in the terminal) to make the stats print immediately.</p>
<h3 id="stats-file-name-length-integer">--stats-file-name-length integer</h3>
<p>By default, the <code>--stats</code> output will truncate file names and paths longer than 40 characters. This is equivalent to providing <code>--stats-file-name-length 40</code>. Use <code>--stats-file-name-length 0</code> to disable any truncation of file names printed by stats.</p>
<h3 id="stats-log-level-string">--stats-log-level string</h3>
<p>Log level to show <code>--stats</code> output at. This can be <code>DEBUG</code>, <code>INFO</code>, <code>NOTICE</code>, or <code>ERROR</code>. The default is <code>INFO</code>. This means at the default level of logging which is <code>NOTICE</code> the stats won't show - if you want them to then use <code>--stats-log-level NOTICE</code>. See the <a href="#logging">Logging section</a> for more info on log levels.</p>
<h3 id="stats-one-line">--stats-one-line</h3>
<p>When this is specified, rclone condenses the stats into a single line showing the most important stats only.</p>
<h3 id="stats-one-line-date">--stats-one-line-date</h3>
<p>When this is specified, rclone enables the single-line stats and prepends the display with a date string. The default is <code>2006/01/02 15:04:05 -</code></p>
<h3 id="stats-one-line-date-format">--stats-one-line-date-format</h3>
<p>When this is specified, rclone enables the single-line stats and prepends the display with a user-supplied date string. The date string MUST be enclosed in quotes. Follow <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Format">golang specs</a> for date formatting syntax.</p>
<h3 id="stats-unitbitsbytes">--stats-unit=bits|bytes</h3>
<p>By default, data transfer rates will be printed in bytes per second.</p>
<p>This option allows the data rate to be printed in bits per second.</p>
<p>Data transfer volume will still be reported in bytes.</p>
<p>The rate is reported as a binary unit, not SI unit. So 1 Mbit/s equals 1,048,576 bit/s and not 1,000,000 bit/s.</p>
<p>The default is <code>bytes</code>.</p>
<h3 id="suffixsuffix">--suffix=SUFFIX</h3>
<p>When using <code>sync</code>, <code>copy</code> or <code>move</code> any files which would have been overwritten or deleted will have the suffix added to them. If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has been added), then it will be overwritten.</p>
<p>The remote in use must support server-side move or copy and you must use the same remote as the destination of the sync.</p>
<p>This is for use with files to add the suffix in the current directory or with <code>--backup-dir</code>. See <code>--backup-dir</code> for more info.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy --interactive /path/to/local/file remote:current --suffix .bak</code></pre>
<p>will copy <code>/path/to/local</code> to <code>remote:current</code>, but for any files which would have been updated or deleted have .bak added.</p>
<p>If using <code>rclone sync</code> with <code>--suffix</code> and without <code>--backup-dir</code> then it is recommended to put a filter rule in excluding the suffix otherwise the <code>sync</code> will delete the backup files.</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive /path/to/local/file remote:current --suffix .bak --exclude &quot;*.bak&quot;</code></pre>
<h3 id="suffix-keep-extension">--suffix-keep-extension</h3>
<p>When using <code>--suffix</code>, setting this causes rclone put the SUFFIX before the extension of the files that it backs up rather than after.</p>
<p>So let's say we had <code>--suffix -2019-01-01</code>, without the flag <code>file.txt</code> would be backed up to <code>file.txt-2019-01-01</code> and with the flag it would be backed up to <code>file-2019-01-01.txt</code>. This can be helpful to make sure the suffixed files can still be opened.</p>
<p>If a file has two (or more) extensions and the second (or subsequent) extension is recognised as a valid mime type, then the suffix will go before that extension. So <code>file.tar.gz</code> would be backed up to <code>file-2019-01-01.tar.gz</code> whereas <code>file.badextension.gz</code> would be backed up to <code>file.badextension-2019-01-01.gz</code>.</p>
<h3 id="syslog">--syslog</h3>
<p>On capable OSes (not Windows or Plan9) send all log output to syslog.</p>
<p>This can be useful for running rclone in a script or <code>rclone mount</code>.</p>
<h3 id="syslog-facility-string">--syslog-facility string</h3>
<p>If using <code>--syslog</code> this sets the syslog facility (e.g. <code>KERN</code>, <code>USER</code>). See <code>man syslog</code> for a list of possible facilities. The default facility is <code>DAEMON</code>.</p>
<h3 id="temp-dirdir">--temp-dir=DIR</h3>
<p>Specify the directory rclone will use for temporary files, to override the default. Make sure the directory exists and have accessible permissions.</p>
<p>By default the operating system's temp directory will be used: - On Unix systems, <code>$TMPDIR</code> if non-empty, else <code>/tmp</code>. - On Windows, the first non-empty value from <code>%TMP%</code>, <code>%TEMP%</code>, <code>%USERPROFILE%</code>, or the Windows directory.</p>
<p>When overriding the default with this option, the specified path will be set as value of environment variable <code>TMPDIR</code> on Unix systems and <code>TMP</code> and <code>TEMP</code> on Windows.</p>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_paths/">config paths</a> command to see the current value.</p>
<h3 id="tpslimit-float">--tpslimit float</h3>
<p>Limit transactions per second to this number. Default is 0 which is used to mean unlimited transactions per second.</p>
<p>A transaction is roughly defined as an API call; its exact meaning will depend on the backend. For HTTP based backends it is an HTTP PUT/GET/POST/etc and its response. For FTP/SFTP it is a round trip transaction over TCP.</p>
<p>For example, to limit rclone to 10 transactions per second use <code>--tpslimit 10</code>, or to 1 transaction every 2 seconds use <code>--tpslimit 0.5</code>.</p>
<p>Use this when the number of transactions per second from rclone is causing a problem with the cloud storage provider (e.g. getting you banned or rate limited).</p>
<p>This can be very useful for <code>rclone mount</code> to control the behaviour of applications using it.</p>
<p>This limit applies to all HTTP based backends and to the FTP and SFTP backends. It does not apply to the local backend or the Storj backend.</p>
<p>See also <code>--tpslimit-burst</code>.</p>
<h3 id="tpslimit-burst-int">--tpslimit-burst int</h3>
<p>Max burst of transactions for <code>--tpslimit</code> (default <code>1</code>).</p>
<p>Normally <code>--tpslimit</code> will do exactly the number of transaction per second specified. However if you supply <code>--tps-burst</code> then rclone can save up some transactions from when it was idle giving a burst of up to the parameter supplied.</p>
<p>For example if you provide <code>--tpslimit-burst 10</code> then if rclone has been idle for more than 10*<code>--tpslimit</code> then it can do 10 transactions very quickly before they are limited again.</p>
<p>This may be used to increase performance of <code>--tpslimit</code> without changing the long term average number of transactions per second.</p>
<h3 id="track-renames">--track-renames</h3>
<p>By default, rclone doesn't keep track of renamed files, so if you rename a file locally then sync it to a remote, rclone will delete the old file on the remote and upload a new copy.</p>
<p>An rclone sync with <code>--track-renames</code> runs like a normal sync, but keeps track of objects which exist in the destination but not in the source (which would normally be deleted), and which objects exist in the source but not the destination (which would normally be transferred). These objects are then candidates for renaming.</p>
<p>After the sync, rclone matches up the source only and destination only objects using the <code>--track-renames-strategy</code> specified and either renames the destination object or transfers the source and deletes the destination object. <code>--track-renames</code> is stateless like all of rclone's syncs.</p>
<p>To use this flag the destination must support server-side copy or server-side move, and to use a hash based <code>--track-renames-strategy</code> (the default) the source and the destination must have a compatible hash.</p>
<p>If the destination does not support server-side copy or move, rclone will fall back to the default behaviour and log an error level message to the console.</p>
<p>Encrypted destinations are not currently supported by <code>--track-renames</code> if <code>--track-renames-strategy</code> includes <code>hash</code>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--track-renames</code> is incompatible with <code>--no-traverse</code> and that it uses extra memory to keep track of all the rename candidates.</p>
<p>Note also that <code>--track-renames</code> is incompatible with <code>--delete-before</code> and will select <code>--delete-after</code> instead of <code>--delete-during</code>.</p>
<h3 id="track-renames-strategy-hashmodtimeleafsize">--track-renames-strategy (hash,modtime,leaf,size)</h3>
<p>This option changes the file matching criteria for <code>--track-renames</code>.</p>
<p>The matching is controlled by a comma separated selection of these tokens:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>modtime</code> - the modification time of the file - not supported on all backends</li>
<li><code>hash</code> - the hash of the file contents - not supported on all backends</li>
<li><code>leaf</code> - the name of the file not including its directory name</li>
<li><code>size</code> - the size of the file (this is always enabled)</li>
</ul>
<p>The default option is <code>hash</code>.</p>
<p>Using <code>--track-renames-strategy modtime,leaf</code> would match files based on modification time, the leaf of the file name and the size only.</p>
<p>Using <code>--track-renames-strategy modtime</code> or <code>leaf</code> can enable <code>--track-renames</code> support for encrypted destinations.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>hash</code> strategy is not supported with encrypted destinations.</p>
<h3 id="delete-beforeduringafter">--delete-(before,during,after)</h3>
<p>This option allows you to specify when files on your destination are deleted when you sync folders.</p>
<p>Specifying the value <code>--delete-before</code> will delete all files present on the destination, but not on the source <em>before</em> starting the transfer of any new or updated files. This uses two passes through the file systems, one for the deletions and one for the copies.</p>
<p>Specifying <code>--delete-during</code> will delete files while checking and uploading files. This is the fastest option and uses the least memory.</p>
<p>Specifying <code>--delete-after</code> (the default value) will delay deletion of files until all new/updated files have been successfully transferred. The files to be deleted are collected in the copy pass then deleted after the copy pass has completed successfully. The files to be deleted are held in memory so this mode may use more memory. This is the safest mode as it will only delete files if there have been no errors subsequent to that. If there have been errors before the deletions start then you will get the message <code>not deleting files as there were IO errors</code>.</p>
<h3 id="fast-list">--fast-list</h3>
<p>When doing anything which involves a directory listing (e.g. <code>sync</code>, <code>copy</code>, <code>ls</code> - in fact nearly every command), rclone has different strategies to choose from.</p>
<p>The basic strategy is to list one directory and processes it before using more directory lists to process any subdirectories. This is a mandatory backend feature, called <code>List</code>, which means it is supported by all backends. This strategy uses small amount of memory, and because it can be parallelised it is fast for operations involving processing of the list results.</p>
<p>Some backends provide the support for an alternative strategy, where all files beneath a directory can be listed in one (or a small number) of transactions. Rclone supports this alternative strategy through an optional backend feature called <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#listr"><code>ListR</code></a>. You can see in the storage system overview documentation's <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">optional features</a> section which backends it is enabled for (these tend to be the bucket-based ones, e.g. S3, B2, GCS, Swift). This strategy requires fewer transactions for highly recursive operations, which is important on backends where this is charged or heavily rate limited. It may be faster (due to fewer transactions) or slower (because it can't be parallelized) depending on different parameters, and may require more memory if rclone has to keep the whole listing in memory.</p>
<p>Which listing strategy rclone picks for a given operation is complicated, but in general it tries to choose the best possible. It will prefer <code>ListR</code> in situations where it doesn't need to store the listed files in memory, e.g. for unlimited recursive <code>ls</code> command variants. In other situations it will prefer <code>List</code>, e.g. for <code>sync</code> and <code>copy</code>, where it needs to keep the listed files in memory, and is performing operations on them where parallelization may be a huge advantage.</p>
<p>Rclone is not able to take all relevant parameters into account for deciding the best strategy, and therefore allows you to influence the choice in two ways: You can stop rclone from using <code>ListR</code> by disabling the feature, using the <a href="#disable-feature-feature">--disable</a> option (<code>--disable ListR</code>), or you can allow rclone to use <code>ListR</code> where it would normally choose not to do so due to higher memory usage, using the <code>--fast-list</code> option. Rclone should always produce identical results either way. Using <code>--disable ListR</code> or <code>--fast-list</code> on a remote which doesn't support <code>ListR</code> does nothing, rclone will just ignore it.</p>
<p>A rule of thumb is that if you pay for transactions and can fit your entire sync listing into memory, then <code>--fast-list</code> is recommended. If you have a very big sync to do, then don't use <code>--fast-list</code>, otherwise you will run out of memory. Run some tests and compare before you decide, and if in doubt then just leave the default, let rclone decide, i.e. not use <code>--fast-list</code>.</p>
<h3 id="timeouttime">--timeout=TIME</h3>
<p>This sets the IO idle timeout. If a transfer has started but then becomes idle for this long it is considered broken and disconnected.</p>
<p>The default is <code>5m</code>. Set to <code>0</code> to disable.</p>
<h3 id="transfersn">--transfers=N</h3>
<p>The number of file transfers to run in parallel. It can sometimes be useful to set this to a smaller number if the remote is giving a lot of timeouts or bigger if you have lots of bandwidth and a fast remote.</p>
<p>The default is to run 4 file transfers in parallel.</p>
<p>Look at --multi-thread-streams if you would like to control single file transfers.</p>
<h3 id="u---update">-u, --update</h3>
<p>This forces rclone to skip any files which exist on the destination and have a modified time that is newer than the source file.</p>
<p>This can be useful in avoiding needless transfers when transferring to a remote which doesn't support modification times directly (or when using <code>--use-server-modtime</code> to avoid extra API calls) as it is more accurate than a <code>--size-only</code> check and faster than using <code>--checksum</code>. On such remotes (or when using <code>--use-server-modtime</code>) the time checked will be the uploaded time.</p>
<p>If an existing destination file has a modification time older than the source file's, it will be updated if the sizes are different. If the sizes are the same, it will be updated if the checksum is different or not available.</p>
<p>If an existing destination file has a modification time equal (within the computed modify window) to the source file's, it will be updated if the sizes are different. The checksum will not be checked in this case unless the <code>--checksum</code> flag is provided.</p>
<p>In all other cases the file will not be updated.</p>
<p>Consider using the <code>--modify-window</code> flag to compensate for time skews between the source and the backend, for backends that do not support mod times, and instead use uploaded times. However, if the backend does not support checksums, note that syncing or copying within the time skew window may still result in additional transfers for safety.</p>
<h3 id="use-mmap">--use-mmap</h3>
<p>If this flag is set then rclone will use anonymous memory allocated by mmap on Unix based platforms and VirtualAlloc on Windows for its transfer buffers (size controlled by <code>--buffer-size</code>). Memory allocated like this does not go on the Go heap and can be returned to the OS immediately when it is finished with.</p>
<p>If this flag is not set then rclone will allocate and free the buffers using the Go memory allocator which may use more memory as memory pages are returned less aggressively to the OS.</p>
<p>It is possible this does not work well on all platforms so it is disabled by default; in the future it may be enabled by default.</p>
<h3 id="use-server-modtime">--use-server-modtime</h3>
<p>Some object-store backends (e.g, Swift, S3) do not preserve file modification times (modtime). On these backends, rclone stores the original modtime as additional metadata on the object. By default it will make an API call to retrieve the metadata when the modtime is needed by an operation.</p>
<p>Use this flag to disable the extra API call and rely instead on the server's modified time. In cases such as a local to remote sync using <code>--update</code>, knowing the local file is newer than the time it was last uploaded to the remote is sufficient. In those cases, this flag can speed up the process and reduce the number of API calls necessary.</p>
<p>Using this flag on a sync operation without also using <code>--update</code> would cause all files modified at any time other than the last upload time to be uploaded again, which is probably not what you want.</p>
<h3 id="v--vv---verbose">-v, -vv, --verbose</h3>
<p>With <code>-v</code> rclone will tell you about each file that is transferred and a small number of significant events.</p>
<p>With <code>-vv</code> rclone will become very verbose telling you about every file it considers and transfers. Please send bug reports with a log with this setting.</p>
<p>When setting verbosity as an environment variable, use <code>RCLONE_VERBOSE=1</code> or <code>RCLONE_VERBOSE=2</code> for <code>-v</code> and <code>-vv</code> respectively.</p>
<h3 id="v---version">-V, --version</h3>
<p>Prints the version number</p>
<h2 id="ssltls-options">SSL/TLS options</h2>
<p>The outgoing SSL/TLS connections rclone makes can be controlled with these options. For example this can be very useful with the HTTP or WebDAV backends. Rclone HTTP servers have their own set of configuration for SSL/TLS which you can find in their documentation.</p>
<h3 id="ca-cert-stringarray">--ca-cert stringArray</h3>
<p>This loads the PEM encoded certificate authority certificates and uses it to verify the certificates of the servers rclone connects to.</p>
<p>If you have generated certificates signed with a local CA then you will need this flag to connect to servers using those certificates.</p>
<h3 id="client-cert-string">--client-cert string</h3>
<p>This loads the PEM encoded client side certificate.</p>
<p>This is used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication">mutual TLS authentication</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>--client-key</code> flag is required too when using this.</p>
<h3 id="client-key-string">--client-key string</h3>
<p>This loads the PEM encoded client side private key used for mutual TLS authentication. Used in conjunction with <code>--client-cert</code>.</p>
<h3 id="no-check-certificatetruefalse">--no-check-certificate=true/false</h3>
<p><code>--no-check-certificate</code> controls whether a client verifies the server's certificate chain and host name. If <code>--no-check-certificate</code> is true, TLS accepts any certificate presented by the server and any host name in that certificate. In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
<p>This option defaults to <code>false</code>.</p>
<p><strong>This should be used only for testing.</strong></p>
<h2 id="configuration-encryption">Configuration Encryption</h2>
<p>Your configuration file contains information for logging in to your cloud services. This means that you should keep your <code>rclone.conf</code> file in a secure location.</p>
<p>If you are in an environment where that isn't possible, you can add a password to your configuration. This means that you will have to supply the password every time you start rclone.</p>
<p>To add a password to your rclone configuration, execute <code>rclone config</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;rclone config
Current remotes:

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/s/q&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Go into <code>s</code>, Set configuration password:</p>

<p>Your configuration is now encrypted, and every time you start rclone you will have to supply the password. See below for details. In the same menu, you can change the password or completely remove encryption from your configuration.</p>
<p>There is no way to recover the configuration if you lose your password.</p>
<p>You can also use</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_encryption_set/">rclone config encryption set</a> to set the config encryption directly</li>
<li><a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_encryption_remove/">rclone config encryption remove</a> to remove it</li>
<li><a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_encryption_check/">rclone config encryption check</a> to check that it is encrypted properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>rclone uses <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox">nacl secretbox</a> which in turn uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate your configuration with secret-key cryptography. The password is SHA-256 hashed, which produces the key for secretbox. The hashed password is not stored.</p>
<p>While this provides very good security, we do not recommend storing your encrypted rclone configuration in public if it contains sensitive information, maybe except if you use a very strong password.</p>
<p>If it is safe in your environment, you can set the <code>RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS</code> environment variable to contain your password, in which case it will be used for decrypting the configuration.</p>
<p>You can set this for a session from a script. For unix like systems save this to a file called <code>set-rclone-password</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/echo Source this file don&#39;t run it

read -s RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
export RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS</code></pre>
<p>Then source the file when you want to use it. From the shell you would do <code>source set-rclone-password</code>. It will then ask you for the password and set it in the environment variable.</p>
<p>An alternate means of supplying the password is to provide a script which will retrieve the password and print on standard output. This script should have a fully specified path name and not rely on any environment variables. The script is supplied either via <a href="#password-command"><code>--password-command="..."</code></a> command line argument or via the <code>RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>One useful example of this is using the <code>passwordstore</code> application to retrieve the password:</p>
<pre><code>export RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND=&quot;pass rclone/config&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>passwordstore</code> password manager holds the password for the rclone configuration, using the script method means the password is primarily protected by the <code>passwordstore</code> system, and is never embedded in the clear in scripts, nor available for examination using the standard commands available. It is quite possible with long running rclone sessions for copies of passwords to be innocently captured in log files or terminal scroll buffers, etc. Using the script method of supplying the password enhances the security of the config password considerably.</p>
<p>If you are running rclone inside a script, unless you are using the <code>--password-command</code> method, you might want to disable password prompts. To do that, pass the parameter <code>--ask-password=false</code> to rclone. This will make rclone fail instead of asking for a password if <code>RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS</code> doesn't contain a valid password, and <code>--password-command</code> has not been supplied.</p>
<p>Whenever running commands that may be affected by options in a configuration file, rclone will look for an existing file according to the rules described <a href="#config-config-file">above</a>, and load any it finds. If an encrypted file is found, this includes decrypting it, with the possible consequence of a password prompt. When executing a command line that you know are not actually using anything from such a configuration file, you can avoid it being loaded by overriding the location, e.g. with one of the documented special values for memory-only configuration. Since only backend options can be stored in configuration files, this is normally unnecessary for commands that do not operate on backends, e.g. <code>completion</code>. However, it will be relevant for commands that do operate on backends in general, but are used without referencing a stored remote, e.g. listing local filesystem paths, or <a href="#connection-strings">connection strings</a>: <code>rclone --config="" ls .</code></p>

<h2 id="developer-options">Developer options</h2>
<p>These options are useful when developing or debugging rclone. There are also some more remote specific options which aren't documented here which are used for testing. These start with remote name e.g. <code>--drive-test-option</code> - see the docs for the remote in question.</p>
<h3 id="cpuprofilefile">--cpuprofile=FILE</h3>
<p>Write CPU profile to file. This can be analysed with <code>go tool pprof</code>.</p>
<h4 id="dump-flagflagflag">--dump flag,flag,flag</h4>
<p>The <code>--dump</code> flag takes a comma separated list of flags to dump info about.</p>
<p>Note that some headers including <code>Accept-Encoding</code> as shown may not be correct in the request and the response may not show <code>Content-Encoding</code> if the go standard libraries auto gzip encoding was in effect. In this case the body of the request will be gunzipped before showing it.</p>
<p>The available flags are:</p>
<h4 id="dump-headers">--dump headers</h4>
<p>Dump HTTP headers with <code>Authorization:</code> lines removed. May still contain sensitive info. Can be very verbose. Useful for debugging only.</p>
<p>Use <code>--dump auth</code> if you do want the <code>Authorization:</code> headers.</p>
<h4 id="dump-bodies">--dump bodies</h4>
<p>Dump HTTP headers and bodies - may contain sensitive info. Can be very verbose. Useful for debugging only.</p>
<p>Note that the bodies are buffered in memory so don't use this for enormous files.</p>
<h4 id="dump-requests">--dump requests</h4>
<p>Like <code>--dump bodies</code> but dumps the request bodies and the response headers. Useful for debugging download problems.</p>
<h4 id="dump-responses">--dump responses</h4>
<p>Like <code>--dump bodies</code> but dumps the response bodies and the request headers. Useful for debugging upload problems.</p>
<h4 id="dump-auth">--dump auth</h4>

<li><code>--rc</code></li>
<li>and anything starting with <code>--rc-</code></li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/rc/">the remote control section</a>.</p>
<h2 id="logging">Logging</h2>
<p>rclone has 4 levels of logging, <code>ERROR</code>, <code>NOTICE</code>, <code>INFO</code> and <code>DEBUG</code>.</p>
<p>By default, rclone logs to standard error. This means you can redirect standard error and still see the normal output of rclone commands (e.g. <code>rclone ls</code>).</p>
<p>By default, rclone will produce <code>Error</code> and <code>Notice</code> level messages.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>-q</code> flag, rclone will only produce <code>Error</code> messages.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>-v</code> flag, rclone will produce <code>Error</code>, <code>Notice</code> and <code>Info</code> messages.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>-vv</code> flag, rclone will produce <code>Error</code>, <code>Notice</code>, <code>Info</code> and <code>Debug</code> messages.</p>
<p>You can also control the log levels with the <code>--log-level</code> flag.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>--log-file=FILE</code> option, rclone will redirect <code>Error</code>, <code>Info</code> and <code>Debug</code> messages along with standard error to FILE.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>--syslog</code> flag then rclone will log to syslog and the <code>--syslog-facility</code> control which facility it uses.</p>
<p>Rclone prefixes all log messages with their level in capitals, e.g. INFO which makes it easy to grep the log file for different kinds of information.</p>
<h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<p>Rclone can publish metrics in the OpenMetrics/Prometheus format.</p>
<p>To enable the metrics endpoint, use the <code>--metrics-addr</code> flag. Metrics can also be published on the <code>--rc-addr</code> port if the <code>--rc</code> flag and <code>--rc-enable-metrics</code> flags are supplied or if using rclone rcd <code>--rc-enable-metrics</code></p>
<p>Rclone provides extensive configuration options for the metrics HTTP endpoint. These settings are grouped under the Metrics section and have a prefix <code>--metrics-*</code>.</p>
<p>When metrics are enabled with <code>--rc-enable-metrics</code>, they will be published on the same port as the rc API. In this case, the <code>--metrics-*</code> flags will be ignored, and the HTTP endpoint configuration will be managed by the <code>--rc-*</code> parameters.</p>
<h2 id="exit-code">Exit Code</h2>
<p>If any errors occur during the command execution, rclone will exit with a non-zero exit code. This allows scripts to detect when rclone operations have failed.</p>
<p>During the startup phase, rclone will exit immediately if an error is detected in the configuration. There will always be a log message immediately before exiting.</p>
<p>When rclone is running it will accumulate errors as it goes along, and only exit with a non-zero exit code if (after retries) there were still failed transfers. For every error counted there will be a high priority log message (visible with <code>-q</code>) showing the message and which file caused the problem. A high priority message is also shown when starting a retry so the user can see that any previous error messages may not be valid after the retry. If rclone has done a retry it will log a high priority message if the retry was successful.</p>
<h3 id="list-of-exit-codes">List of exit codes</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code> - Success</li>
<li><code>1</code> - Error not otherwise categorised</li>
<li><code>2</code> - Syntax or usage error</li>
<li><code>3</code> - Directory not found</li>
<li><code>4</code> - File not found</li>
<li><code>5</code> - Temporary error (one that more retries might fix) (Retry errors)</li>
<li><code>6</code> - Less serious errors (like 461 errors from dropbox) (NoRetry errors)</li>
<li><code>7</code> - Fatal error (one that more retries won't fix, like account suspended) (Fatal errors)</li>
<li><code>8</code> - Transfer exceeded - limit set by --max-transfer reached</li>
<li><code>9</code> - Operation successful, but no files transferred (Requires <a href="#error-on-no-transfer"><code>--error-on-no-transfer</code></a>)</li>
<li><code>10</code> - Duration exceeded - limit set by --max-duration reached</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="environment-variables">Environment Variables</h2>
<p>Rclone can be configured entirely using environment variables. These can be used to set defaults for options or config file entries.</p>
<h3 id="options-92">Options</h3>
<p>Every option in rclone can have its default set by environment variable.</p>
<p>To find the name of the environment variable, first, take the long option name, strip the leading <code>--</code>, change <code>-</code> to <code>_</code>, make upper case and prepend <code>RCLONE_</code>.</p>
<p>For example, to always set <code>--stats 5s</code>, set the environment variable <code>RCLONE_STATS=5s</code>. If you set stats on the command line this will override the environment variable setting.</p>
<p>Or to always use the trash in drive <code>--drive-use-trash</code>, set <code>RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH=true</code>.</p>
<p>Verbosity is slightly different, the environment variable equivalent of <code>--verbose</code> or <code>-v</code> is <code>RCLONE_VERBOSE=1</code>, or for <code>-vv</code>, <code>RCLONE_VERBOSE=2</code>.</p>
<p>The same parser is used for the options and the environment variables so they take exactly the same form.</p>
<p>The options set by environment variables can be seen with the <code>-vv</code> flag, e.g. <code>rclone version -vv</code>.</p>
<p>Options that can appear multiple times (type <code>stringArray</code>) are treated slightly differently as environment variables can only be defined once. In order to allow a simple mechanism for adding one or many items, the input is treated as a <a href="https://godoc.org/encoding/csv">CSV encoded</a> string. For example</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 52%" />
<col style="width: 47%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Environment Variable</th>
<th>Equivalent options</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>RCLONE_EXCLUDE="*.jpg"</code></td>
<td><code>--exclude "*.jpg"</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>RCLONE_EXCLUDE="*.jpg,*.png"</code></td>
<td><code>--exclude "*.jpg"</code> <code>--exclude "*.png"</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>RCLONE_EXCLUDE='"*.jpg","*.png"'</code></td>
<td><code>--exclude "*.jpg"</code> <code>--exclude "*.png"</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>RCLONE_EXCLUDE='"/directory with comma , in it /**"'</code></td>
<td>`--exclude "/directory with comma , in it /**"</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If <code>stringArray</code> options are defined as environment variables <strong>and</strong> options on the command line then all the values will be used.</p>
<h3 id="config-file">Config file</h3>
<p>You can set defaults for values in the config file on an individual remote basis. The names of the config items are documented in the page for each backend.</p>
<p>To find the name of the environment variable, you need to set, take <code>RCLONE_CONFIG_</code> + name of remote + <code>_</code> + name of config file option and make it all uppercase. Note one implication here is the remote's name must be convertible into a valid environment variable name, so it can only contain letters, digits, or the <code>_</code> (underscore) character.</p>
<p>For example, to configure an S3 remote named <code>mys3:</code> without a config file (using unix ways of setting environment variables):</p>
<pre><code>$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_TYPE=s3
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
$ rclone lsd mys3:
          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
$ rclone listremotes | grep mys3
mys3:</code></pre>
<p>Note that if you want to create a remote using environment variables you must create the <code>..._TYPE</code> variable as above.</p>
<p>Note that the name of a remote created using environment variable is case insensitive, in contrast to regular remotes stored in config file as documented <a href="#valid-remote-names">above</a>. You must write the name in uppercase in the environment variable, but as seen from example above it will be listed and can be accessed in lowercase, while you can also refer to the same remote in uppercase:</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone lsd mys3:
          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
$ rclone lsd MYS3:
          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket</code></pre>
<p>Note that you can only set the options of the immediate backend, so RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3CRYPT_ACCESS_KEY_ID has no effect, if myS3Crypt is a crypt remote based on an S3 remote. However RCLONE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID will set the access key of all remotes using S3, including myS3Crypt.</p>
<p>Note also that now rclone has <a href="#connection-strings">connection strings</a>, it is probably easier to use those instead which makes the above example</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd :s3,access_key_id=XXX,secret_access_key=XXX:</code></pre>
<h3 id="precedence">Precedence</h3>
<p>The various different methods of backend configuration are read in this order and the first one with a value is used.</p>
<ul>
<li>Parameters in connection strings, e.g. <code>myRemote,skip_links:</code></li>
<li>Flag values as supplied on the command line, e.g. <code>--skip-links</code></li>
<li>Remote specific environment vars, e.g. <code>RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_SKIP_LINKS</code> (see above).</li>
<li>Backend-specific environment vars, e.g. <code>RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS</code>.</li>
<li>Backend generic environment vars, e.g. <code>RCLONE_SKIP_LINKS</code>.</li>
<li>Config file, e.g. <code>skip_links = true</code>.</li>
<li>Default values, e.g. <code>false</code> - these can't be changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if both <code>--skip-links</code> is supplied on the command line and an environment variable <code>RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS</code> is set, the command line flag will take preference.</p>
<p>The backend configurations set by environment variables can be seen with the <code>-vv</code> flag, e.g. <code>rclone about myRemote: -vv</code>.</p>
<p>For non backend configuration the order is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flag values as supplied on the command line, e.g. <code>--stats 5s</code>.</li>
<li>Environment vars, e.g. <code>RCLONE_STATS=5s</code>.</li>
<li>Default values, e.g. <code>1m</code> - these can't be changed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-environment-variables">Other environment variables</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS</code> set to contain your config file password (see <a href="#configuration-encryption">Configuration Encryption</a> section)</li>
<li><code>HTTP_PROXY</code>, <code>HTTPS_PROXY</code> and <code>NO_PROXY</code> (or the lowercase versions thereof).
<ul>
<li><code>HTTPS_PROXY</code> takes precedence over <code>HTTP_PROXY</code> for https requests.</li>
<li>The environment values may be either a complete URL or a "host[:port]" for, in which case the "http" scheme is assumed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>USER</code> and <code>LOGNAME</code> values are used as fallbacks for current username. The primary method for looking up username is OS-specific: Windows API on Windows, real user ID in /etc/passwd on Unix systems. In the documentation the current username is simply referred to as <code>$USER</code>.</li>
<li><code>RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR</code> - rclone <strong>sets</strong> this variable for use in config files and sub processes to point to the directory holding the config file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The options set by environment variables can be seen with the <code>-vv</code> and <code>--log-level=DEBUG</code> flags, e.g. <code>rclone version -vv</code>.</p>
<h1 id="configuring-rclone-on-a-remote-headless-machine">Configuring rclone on a remote / headless machine</h1>
<p>Some of the configurations (those involving oauth2) require an Internet connected web browser.</p>
<p>If you are trying to set rclone up on a remote or headless box with no browser available on it (e.g. a NAS or a server in a datacenter) then you will need to use an alternative means of configuration. There are two ways of doing it, described below.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-using-rclone-authorize">Configuring using rclone authorize</h2>
<p>On the headless box run <code>rclone</code> config but answer <code>N</code> to the <code>Use auto config?</code> question.</p>
<pre><code>Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine

y) Yes (default)
n) No
y/n&gt; n

Option config_token.
For this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has
a web browser available.
For more help and alternate methods see: https://rclone.org/remote_setup/
Execute the following on the machine with the web browser (same rclone
version recommended):
    rclone authorize &quot;onedrive&quot;
Then paste the result.
Enter a value.
config_token&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Then on your main desktop machine</p>
<pre><code>rclone authorize &quot;onedrive&quot;
If your browser doesn&#39;t open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
Paste the following into your remote machine ---&gt;
SECRET_TOKEN
&lt;---End paste</code></pre>
<p>Then back to the headless box, paste in the code</p>
<pre><code>config_token&gt; SECRET_TOKEN
--------------------
[acd12]
client_id = 
client_secret = 
token = SECRET_TOKEN
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="configuring-by-copying-the-config-file">Configuring by copying the config file</h2>
<p>Rclone stores all of its config in a single configuration file. This can easily be copied to configure a remote rclone.</p>
<p>So first configure rclone on your desktop machine with</p>
<pre><code>rclone config</code></pre>
<p>to set up the config file.</p>
<p>Find the config file by running <code>rclone config file</code>, for example</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone config file
Configuration file is stored at:
/home/user/.rclone.conf</code></pre>
<p>Now transfer it to the remote box (scp, cut paste, ftp, sftp, etc.) and place it in the correct place (use <code>rclone config file</code> on the remote box to find out where).</p>
<h2 id="configuring-using-ssh-tunnel">Configuring using SSH Tunnel</h2>
<p>Linux and MacOS users can utilize SSH Tunnel to redirect the headless box port 53682 to local machine by using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>ssh -L localhost:53682:localhost:53682 username@remote_server</code></pre>
<p>Then on the headless box run <code>rclone config</code> and answer <code>Y</code> to the <code>Use auto config?</code> question.</p>
<pre><code>Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine

y) Yes (default)
n) No
y/n&gt; y</code></pre>
<p>Then copy and paste the auth url <code>http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth?state=xxxxxxxxxxxx</code> to the browser on your local machine, complete the auth and it is done.</p>
<h1 id="filtering-includes-and-excludes">Filtering, includes and excludes</h1>
<p>Filter flags determine which files rclone <code>sync</code>, <code>move</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>lsl</code>, <code>md5sum</code>, <code>sha1sum</code>, <code>size</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>check</code> and similar commands apply to.</p>
<p>They are specified in terms of path/file name patterns; path/file lists; file age and size, or presence of a file in a directory. Bucket based remotes without the concept of directory apply filters to object key, age and size in an analogous way.</p>
<p>Rclone <code>purge</code> does not obey filters.</p>
<p>To test filters without risk of damage to data, apply them to <code>rclone ls</code>, or with the <code>--dry-run</code> and <code>-vv</code> flags.</p>
<p>Rclone filter patterns can only be used in filter command line options, not in the specification of a remote.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>rclone copy "remote:dir*.jpg" /path/to/dir</code> does not have a filter effect. <code>rclone copy remote:dir /path/to/dir --include "*.jpg"</code> does.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> Avoid mixing any two of <code>--include...</code>, <code>--exclude...</code> or <code>--filter...</code> flags in an rclone command. The results might not be what you expect. Instead use a <code>--filter...</code> flag.</p>
<h2 id="patterns-for-matching-pathfile-names">Patterns for matching path/file names</h2>
<h3 id="patterns">Pattern syntax</h3>
<p>Here is a formal definition of the pattern syntax, <a href="#examples">examples</a> are below.</p>
<p>Rclone matching rules follow a glob style:</p>
<pre><code>*         matches any sequence of non-separator (/) characters

<p>If the filter pattern starts with a <code>/</code> then it only matches at the top level of the directory tree, <strong>relative to the root of the remote</strong> (not necessarily the root of the drive). If it does not start with <code>/</code> then it is matched starting at the <strong>end of the path/file name</strong> but it only matches a complete path element - it must match from a <code>/</code> separator or the beginning of the path/file.</p>
<pre><code>file.jpg   - matches &quot;file.jpg&quot;
           - matches &quot;directory/file.jpg&quot;
           - doesn&#39;t match &quot;afile.jpg&quot;
           - doesn&#39;t match &quot;directory/afile.jpg&quot;
/file.jpg  - matches &quot;file.jpg&quot; in the root directory of the remote
           - doesn&#39;t match &quot;afile.jpg&quot;
           - doesn&#39;t match &quot;directory/file.jpg&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The top level of the remote might not be the top level of the drive.</p>
<p>E.g. for a Microsoft Windows local directory structure</p>
<pre><code>F:
├── bkp
├── data
│   ├── excl
│   │   ├── 123.jpg
│   │   └── 456.jpg
│   ├── incl
│   │   └── document.pdf</code></pre>
<p>To copy the contents of folder <code>data</code> into folder <code>bkp</code> excluding the contents of subfolder <code>excl</code>the following command treats <code>F:\data</code> and <code>F:\bkp</code> as top level for filtering.</p>
<p><code>rclone copy F:\data\ F:\bkp\ --exclude=/excl/**</code></p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> Use <code>/</code> in path/file name patterns and not <code>\</code> even if running on Microsoft Windows.</p>
<p>Simple patterns are case sensitive unless the <code>--ignore-case</code> flag is used.</p>
<p>Without <code>--ignore-case</code> (default)</p>
<pre><code>potato - matches &quot;potato&quot;
       - doesn&#39;t match &quot;POTATO&quot;</code></pre>
<p>With <code>--ignore-case</code></p>
<pre><code>potato - matches &quot;potato&quot;
       - matches &quot;POTATO&quot;</code></pre>
<h2 id="regexp">Using regular expressions in filter patterns</h2>
<p>The syntax of filter patterns is glob style matching (like <code>bash</code> uses) to make things easy for users. However this does not provide absolute control over the matching, so for advanced users rclone also provides a regular expression syntax.</p>
<p>The regular expressions used are as defined in the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/">Go regular expression reference</a>. Regular expressions should be enclosed in <code>{{</code> <code>}}</code>. They will match only the last path segment if the glob doesn't start with <code>/</code> or the whole path name if it does. Note that rclone does not attempt to parse the supplied regular expression, meaning that using any regular expression filter will prevent rclone from using <a href="#directory_filter">directory filter rules</a>, as it will instead check every path against the supplied regular expression(s).</p>
<p>Here is how the <code>{{regexp}}</code> is transformed into an full regular expression to match the entire path:</p>
<pre><code>{{regexp}}  becomes (^|/)(regexp)$
/{{regexp}} becomes ^(regexp)$</code></pre>
<p>Regexp syntax can be mixed with glob syntax, for example</p>
<pre><code>*.{{jpe?g}} to match file.jpg, file.jpeg but not file.png</code></pre>
<p>You can also use regexp flags - to set case insensitive, for example</p>
<pre><code>*.{{(?i)jpg}} to match file.jpg, file.JPG but not file.png</code></pre>
<p>Be careful with wildcards in regular expressions - you don't want them to match path separators normally. To match any file name starting with <code>start</code> and ending with <code>end</code> write</p>
<pre><code>{{start[^/]*end\.jpg}}</code></pre>
<p>Not</p>
<pre><code>{{start.*end\.jpg}}</code></pre>
<p>Which will match a directory called <code>start</code> with a file called <code>end.jpg</code> in it as the <code>.*</code> will match <code>/</code> characters.</p>
<p>Note that you can use <code>-vv --dump filters</code> to show the filter patterns in regexp format - rclone implements the glob patterns by transforming them into regular expressions.</p>

<h2 id="how-filter-rules-work">How filter rules are applied to files</h2>
<p>Rclone path/file name filters are made up of one or more of the following flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--include</code></li>
<li><code>--include-from</code></li>
<li><code>--exclude</code></li>
<li><code>--exclude-from</code></li>
<li><code>--filter</code></li>
<li><code>--filter-from</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There can be more than one instance of individual flags.</p>
<p>Rclone internally uses a combined list of all the include and exclude rules. The order in which rules are processed can influence the result of the filter.</p>
<p>All flags of the same type are processed together in the order above, regardless of what order the different types of flags are included on the command line.</p>
<p>Multiple instances of the same flag are processed from left to right according to their position in the command line.</p>
<p>To mix up the order of processing includes and excludes use <code>--filter...</code> flags.</p>
<p>Within <code>--include-from</code>, <code>--exclude-from</code> and <code>--filter-from</code> flags rules are processed from top to bottom of the referenced file.</p>
<p>If there is an <code>--include</code> or <code>--include-from</code> flag specified, rclone implies a <code>- **</code> rule which it adds to the bottom of the internal rule list. Specifying a <code>+</code> rule with a <code>--filter...</code> flag does not imply that rule.</p>
<p>Each path/file name passed through rclone is matched against the combined filter list. At first match to a rule the path/file name is included or excluded and no further filter rules are processed for that path/file.</p>
<p>If rclone does not find a match, after testing against all rules (including the implied rule if appropriate), the path/file name is included.</p>
<p>Any path/file included at that stage is processed by the rclone command.</p>
<p><code>--files-from</code> and <code>--files-from-raw</code> flags over-ride and cannot be combined with other filter options.</p>
<p>To see the internal combined rule list, in regular expression form, for a command add the <code>--dump filters</code> flag. Running an rclone command with <code>--dump filters</code> and <code>-vv</code> flags lists the internal filter elements and shows how they are applied to each source path/file. There is not currently a means provided to pass regular expression filter options into rclone directly though character class filter rules contain character classes. <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/">Go regular expression reference</a></p>
<h3 id="directory_filter">How filter rules are applied to directories</h3>
<p>Rclone commands are applied to path/file names not directories. The entire contents of a directory can be matched to a filter by the pattern <code>directory/*</code> or recursively by <code>directory/**</code>.</p>
<p>Directory filter rules are defined with a closing <code>/</code> separator.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>/directory/subdirectory/</code> is an rclone directory filter rule.</p>
<p>Rclone commands can use directory filter rules to determine whether they recurse into subdirectories. This potentially optimises access to a remote by avoiding listing unnecessary directories. Whether optimisation is desirable depends on the specific filter rules and source remote content.</p>
<p>If any <a href="#regexp">regular expression filters</a> are in use, then no directory recursion optimisation is possible, as rclone must check every path against the supplied regular expression(s).</p>
<p>Directory recursion optimisation occurs if either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A source remote does not support the rclone <code>ListR</code> primitive. local, sftp, Microsoft OneDrive and WebDAV do not support <code>ListR</code>. Google Drive and most bucket type storage do. <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">Full list</a></p></li>
<li><p>On other remotes (those that support <code>ListR</code>), if the rclone command is not naturally recursive, and provided it is not run with the <code>--fast-list</code> flag. <code>ls</code>, <code>lsf -R</code> and <code>size</code> are naturally recursive but <code>sync</code>, <code>copy</code> and <code>move</code> are not.</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever the <code>--disable ListR</code> flag is applied to an rclone command.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Rclone commands imply directory filter rules from path/file filter rules. To view the directory filter rules rclone has implied for a command specify the <code>--dump filters</code> flag.</p>
<p>E.g. for an include rule</p>
<pre><code>/a/*.jpg</code></pre>
<p>Rclone implies the directory include rule</p>
<pre><code>/a/</code></pre>
<p>Directory filter rules specified in an rclone command can limit the scope of an rclone command but path/file filters still have to be specified.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>rclone ls remote: --include /directory/</code> will not match any files. Because it is an <code>--include</code> option the <code>--exclude **</code> rule is implied, and the <code>/directory/</code> pattern serves only to optimise access to the remote by ignoring everything outside of that directory.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>rclone ls remote: --filter-from filter-list.txt</code> with a file <code>filter-list.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>- /dir1/
- /dir2/
+ *.pdf
- **</code></pre>
<p>All files in directories <code>dir1</code> or <code>dir2</code> or their subdirectories are completely excluded from the listing. Only files of suffix <code>pdf</code> in the root of <code>remote:</code> or its subdirectories are listed. The <code>- **</code> rule prevents listing of any path/files not previously matched by the rules above.</p>
<p>Option <code>exclude-if-present</code> creates a directory exclude rule based on the presence of a file in a directory and takes precedence over other rclone directory filter rules.</p>
<p>When using pattern list syntax, if a pattern item contains either <code>/</code> or <code>**</code>, then rclone will not able to imply a directory filter rule from this pattern list.</p>
<p>E.g. for an include rule</p>
<pre><code>{dir1/**,dir2/**}</code></pre>
<p>Rclone will match files below directories <code>dir1</code> or <code>dir2</code> only, but will not be able to use this filter to exclude a directory <code>dir3</code> from being traversed.</p>
<p>Directory recursion optimisation may affect performance, but normally not the result. One exception to this is sync operations with option <code>--create-empty-src-dirs</code>, where any traversed empty directories will be created. With the pattern list example <code>{dir1/**,dir2/**}</code> above, this would create an empty directory <code>dir3</code> on destination (when it exists on source). Changing the filter to <code>{dir1,dir2}/**</code>, or splitting it into two include rules <code>--include dir1/** --include dir2/**</code>, will match the same files while also filtering directories, with the result that an empty directory <code>dir3</code> will no longer be created.</p>
<h3 id="exclude---exclude-files-matching-pattern"><code>--exclude</code> - Exclude files matching pattern</h3>
<p>Excludes path/file names from an rclone command based on a single exclude rule.</p>
<p>This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are processed in.</p>
<p><code>--exclude</code> should not be used with <code>--include</code>, <code>--include-from</code>, <code>--filter</code> or <code>--filter-from</code> flags.</p>
<p><code>--exclude</code> has no effect when combined with <code>--files-from</code> or <code>--files-from-raw</code> flags.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>rclone ls remote: --exclude *.bak</code> excludes all .bak files from listing.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>rclone size remote: --exclude "/dir/**"</code> returns the total size of all files on <code>remote:</code> excluding those in root directory <code>dir</code> and sub directories.</p>
<p>E.g. on Microsoft Windows <code>rclone ls remote: --exclude "*\[{JP,KR,HK}\]*"</code> lists the files in <code>remote:</code> without <code>[JP]</code> or <code>[KR]</code> or <code>[HK]</code> in their name. Quotes prevent the shell from interpreting the <code>\</code> characters.<code>\</code> characters escape the <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> so an rclone filter treats them literally rather than as a character-range. The <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> define an rclone pattern list. For other operating systems single quotes are required ie <code>rclone ls remote: --exclude '*\[{JP,KR,HK}\]*'</code></p>
<h3 id="exclude-from---read-exclude-patterns-from-file"><code>--exclude-from</code> - Read exclude patterns from file</h3>
<p>Excludes path/file names from an rclone command based on rules in a named file. The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules.</p>
<p>For an example <code>exclude-file.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code># a sample exclude rule file
*.bak
file2.jpg</code></pre>
<p><code>rclone ls remote: --exclude-from exclude-file.txt</code> lists the files on <code>remote:</code> except those named <code>file2.jpg</code> or with a suffix <code>.bak</code>. That is equivalent to <code>rclone ls remote: --exclude file2.jpg --exclude "*.bak"</code>.</p>
<p>This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are processed in.</p>
<p>The <code>--exclude-from</code> flag is useful where multiple exclude filter rules are applied to an rclone command.</p>
<p><code>--exclude-from</code> should not be used with <code>--include</code>, <code>--include-from</code>, <code>--filter</code> or <code>--filter-from</code> flags.</p>
<p><code>--exclude-from</code> has no effect when combined with <code>--files-from</code> or <code>--files-from-raw</code> flags.</p>
<p><code>--exclude-from</code> followed by <code>-</code> reads filter rules from standard input.</p>
<h3 id="include---include-files-matching-pattern"><code>--include</code> - Include files matching pattern</h3>
<p>Adds a single include rule based on path/file names to an rclone command.</p>
<p>This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are processed in.</p>
<p><code>--include</code> has no effect when combined with <code>--files-from</code> or <code>--files-from-raw</code> flags.</p>
<p><code>--include</code> implies <code>--exclude **</code> at the end of an rclone internal filter list. Therefore if you mix <code>--include</code> and <code>--include-from</code> flags with <code>--exclude</code>, <code>--exclude-from</code>, <code>--filter</code> or <code>--filter-from</code>, you must use include rules for all the files you want in the include statement. For more flexibility use the <code>--filter-from</code> flag.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>rclone ls remote: --include "*.{png,jpg}"</code> lists the files on <code>remote:</code> with suffix <code>.png</code> and <code>.jpg</code>. All other files are excluded.</p>
<p>E.g. multiple rclone copy commands can be combined with <code>--include</code> and a pattern-list.</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy /vol1/A remote:A
rclone copy /vol1/B remote:B</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy /vol1 remote: --include &quot;{A,B}/**&quot;</code></pre>
<p>E.g. <code>rclone ls remote:/wheat --include "??[^[:punct:]]*"</code> lists the files <code>remote:</code> directory <code>wheat</code> (and subdirectories) whose third character is not punctuation. This example uses an <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/">ASCII character class</a>.</p>
<h3 id="include-from---read-include-patterns-from-file"><code>--include-from</code> - Read include patterns from file</h3>
<p>Adds path/file names to an rclone command based on rules in a named file. The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules.</p>
<p>For an example <code>include-file.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code># a sample include rule file
*.jpg
file2.avi</code></pre>
<p><code>rclone ls remote: --include-from include-file.txt</code> lists the files on <code>remote:</code> with name <code>file2.avi</code> or suffix <code>.jpg</code>. That is equivalent to <code>rclone ls remote: --include file2.avi --include "*.jpg"</code>.</p>
<p>This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are processed in.</p>
<p>The <code>--include-from</code> flag is useful where multiple include filter rules are applied to an rclone command.</p>
<p><code>--include-from</code> implies <code>--exclude **</code> at the end of an rclone internal filter list. Therefore if you mix <code>--include</code> and <code>--include-from</code> flags with <code>--exclude</code>, <code>--exclude-from</code>, <code>--filter</code> or <code>--filter-from</code>, you must use include rules for all the files you want in the include statement. For more flexibility use the <code>--filter-from</code> flag.</p>
<p><code>--include-from</code> has no effect when combined with <code>--files-from</code> or <code>--files-from-raw</code> flags.</p>
<p><code>--include-from</code> followed by <code>-</code> reads filter rules from standard input.</p>
<h3 id="filter---add-a-file-filtering-rule"><code>--filter</code> - Add a file-filtering rule</h3>
<p>Specifies path/file names to an rclone command, based on a single include or exclude rule, in <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> format.</p>
<p>This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are processed in.</p>
<p><code>--filter +</code> differs from <code>--include</code>. In the case of <code>--include</code> rclone implies an <code>--exclude *</code> rule which it adds to the bottom of the internal rule list. <code>--filter...+</code> does not imply that rule.</p>
<p><code>--filter</code> has no effect when combined with <code>--files-from</code> or <code>--files-from-raw</code> flags.</p>
<p><code>--filter</code> should not be used with <code>--include</code>, <code>--include-from</code>, <code>--exclude</code> or <code>--exclude-from</code> flags.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>rclone ls remote: --filter "- *.bak"</code> excludes all <code>.bak</code> files from a list of <code>remote:</code>.</p>
<h3 id="filter-from---read-filtering-patterns-from-a-file"><code>--filter-from</code> - Read filtering patterns from a file</h3>
<p>Adds path/file names to an rclone command based on rules in a named file. The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules. Include rules start with <code>+</code> and exclude rules with <code>-</code>. <code>!</code> clears existing rules. Rules are processed in the order they are defined.</p>
<p>This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are processed in.</p>
<p>Arrange the order of filter rules with the most restrictive first and work down.</p>
<p>Lines starting with # or ; are ignored, and can be used to write comments. Inline comments are not supported. <em>Use <code>-vv --dump filters</code> to see how they appear in the final regexp.</em></p>
<p>E.g. for <code>filter-file.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code># a sample filter rule file
- secret*.jpg
+ *.jpg
+ *.png
+ file2.avi
- /dir/tmp/** # WARNING! This text will be treated as part of the path.
- /dir/Trash/**
+ /dir/**
# exclude everything else
- *</code></pre>
<p><code>rclone ls remote: --filter-from filter-file.txt</code> lists the path/files on <code>remote:</code> including all <code>jpg</code> and <code>png</code> files, excluding any matching <code>secret*.jpg</code> and including <code>file2.avi</code>. It also includes everything in the directory <code>dir</code> at the root of <code>remote</code>, except <code>remote:dir/Trash</code> which it excludes. Everything else is excluded.</p>
<p>E.g. for an alternative <code>filter-file.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>- secret*.jpg
+ *.jpg
+ *.png
+ file2.avi
- *</code></pre>
<p>Files <code>file1.jpg</code>, <code>file3.png</code> and <code>file2.avi</code> are listed whilst <code>secret17.jpg</code> and files without the suffix <code>.jpg</code> or <code>.png</code> are excluded.</p>
<p>E.g. for an alternative <code>filter-file.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>+ *.jpg
+ *.gif
!
+ 42.doc
- *</code></pre>
<p>Only file 42.doc is listed. Prior rules are cleared by the <code>!</code>.</p>
<h3 id="files-from---read-list-of-source-file-names"><code>--files-from</code> - Read list of source-file names</h3>
<p>Adds path/files to an rclone command from a list in a named file. Rclone processes the path/file names in the order of the list, and no others.</p>
<p>Other filter flags (<code>--include</code>, <code>--include-from</code>, <code>--exclude</code>, <code>--exclude-from</code>, <code>--filter</code> and <code>--filter-from</code>) are ignored when <code>--files-from</code> is used.</p>
<p><code>--files-from</code> expects a list of files as its input. Leading or trailing whitespace is stripped from the input lines. Lines starting with <code>#</code> or <code>;</code> are ignored.</p>
<p><code>--files-from</code> followed by <code>-</code> reads the list of files from standard input.</p>
<p>Rclone commands with a <code>--files-from</code> flag traverse the remote, treating the names in <code>--files-from</code> as a set of filters.</p>
<p>If the <code>--no-traverse</code> and <code>--files-from</code> flags are used together an rclone command does not traverse the remote. Instead it addresses each path/file named in the file individually. For each path/file name, that requires typically 1 API call. This can be efficient for a short <code>--files-from</code> list and a remote containing many files.</p>
<p>Rclone commands do not error if any names in the <code>--files-from</code> file are missing from the source remote.</p>
<p>The <code>--files-from</code> flag can be repeated in a single rclone command to read path/file names from more than one file. The files are read from left to right along the command line.</p>
<p>Paths within the <code>--files-from</code> file are interpreted as starting with the root specified in the rclone command. Leading <code>/</code> separators are ignored. See <a href="#files-from-raw-read-list-of-source-file-names-without-any-processing">--files-from-raw</a> if you need the input to be processed in a raw manner.</p>
<p>E.g. for a file <code>files-from.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code># comment
file1.jpg
subdir/file2.jpg</code></pre>
<p><code>rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt /home/me/pics remote:pics</code> copies the following, if they exist, and only those files.</p>
<pre><code>/home/me/pics/file1.jpg        → remote:pics/file1.jpg
/home/me/pics/subdir/file2.jpg → remote:pics/subdir/file2.jpg</code></pre>
<p>E.g. to copy the following files referenced by their absolute paths:</p>
<pre><code>/home/user1/42
/home/user1/dir/ford
/home/user2/prefect</code></pre>
<p>First find a common subdirectory - in this case <code>/home</code> and put the remaining files in <code>files-from.txt</code> with or without leading <code>/</code>, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>user1/42
user1/dir/ford
user2/prefect</code></pre>
<p>Then copy these to a remote:</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt /home remote:backup</code></pre>
<p>The three files are transferred as follows:</p>
<pre><code>/home/user1/42       → remote:backup/user1/important
/home/user1/dir/ford → remote:backup/user1/dir/file
/home/user2/prefect  → remote:backup/user2/stuff</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively if <code>/</code> is chosen as root <code>files-from.txt</code> will be:</p>
<pre><code>/home/user1/42
/home/user1/dir/ford
/home/user2/prefect</code></pre>
<p>The copy command will be:</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt / remote:backup</code></pre>
<p>Then there will be an extra <code>home</code> directory on the remote:</p>
<pre><code>/home/user1/42       → remote:backup/home/user1/42
/home/user1/dir/ford → remote:backup/home/user1/dir/ford
/home/user2/prefect  → remote:backup/home/user2/prefect</code></pre>
<h3 id="files-from-raw---read-list-of-source-file-names-without-any-processing"><code>--files-from-raw</code> - Read list of source-file names without any processing</h3>
<p>This flag is the same as <code>--files-from</code> except that input is read in a raw manner. Lines with leading / trailing whitespace, and lines starting with <code>;</code> or <code>#</code> are read without any processing. <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsf/">rclone lsf</a> has a compatible format that can be used to export file lists from remotes for input to <code>--files-from-raw</code>.</p>
<h3 id="ignore-case---make-searches-case-insensitive"><code>--ignore-case</code> - make searches case insensitive</h3>
<p>By default, rclone filter patterns are case sensitive. The <code>--ignore-case</code> flag makes all of the filters patterns on the command line case insensitive.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>--include "zaphod.txt"</code> does not match a file <code>Zaphod.txt</code>. With <code>--ignore-case</code> a match is made.</p>
<h2 id="quoting-shell-metacharacters">Quoting shell metacharacters</h2>
<p>Rclone commands with filter patterns containing shell metacharacters may not as work as expected in your shell and may require quoting.</p>
<p>E.g. linux, OSX (<code>*</code> metacharacter)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--include \*.jpg</code></li>
<li><code>--include '*.jpg'</code></li>
<li><code>--include='*.jpg'</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft Windows expansion is done by the command, not shell, so <code>--include *.jpg</code> does not require quoting.</p>
<p>If the rclone error <code>Command .... needs .... arguments maximum: you provided .... non flag arguments:</code> is encountered, the cause is commonly spaces within the name of a remote or flag value. The fix then is to quote values containing spaces.</p>
<h2 id="other-filters">Other filters</h2>
<h3 id="min-size---dont-transfer-any-file-smaller-than-this"><code>--min-size</code> - Don't transfer any file smaller than this</h3>
<p>Controls the minimum size file within the scope of an rclone command. Default units are <code>KiB</code> but abbreviations <code>B</code>, <code>K</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>T</code> or <code>P</code> are valid.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>rclone ls remote: --min-size 50k</code> lists files on <code>remote:</code> of 50 KiB size or larger.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#size-option">the size option docs</a> for more info.</p>
<h3 id="max-size---dont-transfer-any-file-larger-than-this"><code>--max-size</code> - Don't transfer any file larger than this</h3>
<p>Controls the maximum size file within the scope of an rclone command. Default units are <code>KiB</code> but abbreviations <code>B</code>, <code>K</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>T</code> or <code>P</code> are valid.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>rclone ls remote: --max-size 1G</code> lists files on <code>remote:</code> of 1 GiB size or smaller.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#size-option">the size option docs</a> for more info.</p>
<h3 id="max-age---dont-transfer-any-file-older-than-this"><code>--max-age</code> - Don't transfer any file older than this</h3>
<p>Controls the maximum age of files within the scope of an rclone command.</p>
<p><code>--max-age</code> applies only to files and not to directories.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>rclone ls remote: --max-age 2d</code> lists files on <code>remote:</code> of 2 days old or less.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#time-option">the time option docs</a> for valid formats.</p>
<h3 id="min-age---dont-transfer-any-file-younger-than-this"><code>--min-age</code> - Don't transfer any file younger than this</h3>
<p>Controls the minimum age of files within the scope of an rclone command. (see <code>--max-age</code> for valid formats)</p>
<p><code>--min-age</code> applies only to files and not to directories.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>rclone ls remote: --min-age 2d</code> lists files on <code>remote:</code> of 2 days old or more.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#time-option">the time option docs</a> for valid formats.</p>
<h3 id="hash-filter"><code>--hash-filter</code> - Deterministically select a subset of files</h3>
<p>The <code>--hash-filter</code> flag enables selecting a deterministic subset of files, useful for:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Running large sync operations across multiple machines.</li>
<li>Checking a subset of files for bitrot.</li>
<li>Any other operations where a sample of files is required.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="syntax">Syntax</h4>
<p>The flag takes two parameters expressed as a fraction:</p>
<pre><code>--hash-filter K/N</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>N</code>: The total number of partitions (must be a positive integer).</li>
<li><code>K</code>: The specific partition to select (an integer from <code>0</code> to <code>N</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: - <code>--hash-filter 1/3</code>: Selects the first third of the files. - <code>--hash-filter 2/3</code> and <code>--hash-filter 3/3</code>: Select the second and third partitions, respectively.</p>
<p>Each partition is non-overlapping, ensuring all files are covered without duplication.</p>
<h4 id="random-partition-selection">Random Partition Selection</h4>
<p>Use <code>@</code> as <code>K</code> to randomly select a partition:</p>
<pre><code>--hash-filter @/M</code></pre>
<p>For example, <code>--hash-filter @/3</code> will randomly select a number between 0 and 2. This will stay constant across retries.</p>
<h4 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rclone takes each file's full path, normalizes it to lowercase, and applies Unicode normalization.</li>
<li>It then hashes the normalized path into a 64 bit number.</li>
<li>The hash result is reduced modulo <code>N</code> to assign the file to a partition.</li>
<li>If the calculated partition does not match <code>K</code> the file is excluded.</li>
<li>Other filters may apply if the file is not excluded.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Rclone will traverse all directories to apply the filter.</p>
<h4 id="usage-notes">Usage Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Safe to use with <code>rclone sync</code>; source and destination selections will match.</li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> use with <code>--delete-excluded</code>, as this could delete unselected files.</li>
<li>Ignored if <code>--files-from</code> is used.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>
<h5 id="dividing-files-into-4-partitions">Dividing files into 4 partitions</h5>
<p>Assuming the current directory contains <code>file1.jpg</code> through <code>file9.jpg</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone lsf --hash-filter 0/4 .
file1.jpg
file5.jpg

$ rclone lsf --hash-filter 1/4 .
file3.jpg
file6.jpg
file9.jpg

$ rclone lsf --hash-filter 2/4 .
file2.jpg
file4.jpg

$ rclone lsf --hash-filter 3/4 .
file7.jpg
file8.jpg

$ rclone lsf --hash-filter 4/4 . # the same as --hash-filter 0/4

file5.jpg</code></pre>
<h5 id="syncing-the-first-quarter-of-files">Syncing the first quarter of files</h5>
<pre><code>rclone sync --hash-filter 1/4 source:path destination:path</code></pre>
<h5 id="checking-a-random-1-of-files-for-integrity">Checking a random 1% of files for integrity</h5>
<pre><code>rclone check --download --hash-filter @/100 source:path destination:path</code></pre>
<h2 id="other-flags">Other flags</h2>
<h3 id="delete-excluded---delete-files-on-dest-excluded-from-sync"><code>--delete-excluded</code> - Delete files on dest excluded from sync</h3>
<p><strong>Important</strong> this flag is dangerous to your data - use with <code>--dry-run</code> and <code>-v</code> first.</p>
<p>In conjunction with <code>rclone sync</code>, <code>--delete-excluded</code> deletes any files on the destination which are excluded from the command.</p>
<p>E.g. the scope of <code>rclone sync --interactive A: B:</code> can be restricted:</p>
<pre><code>rclone --min-size 50k --delete-excluded sync A: B:</code></pre>
<p>All files on <code>B:</code> which are less than 50 KiB are deleted because they are excluded from the rclone sync command.</p>
<h3 id="dump-filters---dump-the-filters-to-the-output"><code>--dump filters</code> - dump the filters to the output</h3>
<p>Dumps the defined filters to standard output in regular expression format.</p>
<p>Useful for debugging.</p>
<h2 id="exclude-directory-based-on-a-file">Exclude directory based on a file</h2>
<p>The <code>--exclude-if-present</code> flag controls whether a directory is within the scope of an rclone command based on the presence of a named file within it. The flag can be repeated to check for multiple file names, presence of any of them will exclude the directory.</p>
<p>This flag has a priority over other filter flags.</p>
<p>E.g. for the following directory structure:</p>
<pre><code>dir1/file1
dir1/dir2/file2
dir1/dir2/dir3/file3
dir1/dir2/dir3/.ignore</code></pre>
<p>The command <code>rclone ls --exclude-if-present .ignore dir1</code> does not list <code>dir3</code>, <code>file3</code> or <code>.ignore</code>.</p>
<h2 id="metadata">Metadata filters</h2>
<p>The metadata filters work in a very similar way to the normal file name filters, except they match <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata">metadata</a> on the object.</p>
<p>The metadata should be specified as <code>key=value</code> patterns. This may be wildcarded using the normal <a href="#patterns">filter patterns</a> or <a href="#regexp">regular expressions</a>.</p>
<p>For example if you wished to list only local files with a mode of <code>100664</code> you could do that with:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf -M --files-only --metadata-include &quot;mode=100664&quot; .</code></pre>
<p>Or if you wished to show files with an <code>atime</code>, <code>mtime</code> or <code>btime</code> at a given date:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf -M --files-only --metadata-include &quot;[abm]time=2022-12-16*&quot; .</code></pre>
<p>Like file filtering, metadata filtering only applies to files not to directories.</p>
<p>The filters can be applied using these flags.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--metadata-include</code> - Include metadatas matching pattern</li>
<li><code>--metadata-include-from</code> - Read metadata include patterns from file (use - to read from stdin)</li>
<li><code>--metadata-exclude</code> - Exclude metadatas matching pattern</li>
<li><code>--metadata-exclude-from</code> - Read metadata exclude patterns from file (use - to read from stdin)</li>
<li><code>--metadata-filter</code> - Add a metadata filtering rule</li>
<li><code>--metadata-filter-from</code> - Read metadata filtering patterns from a file (use - to read from stdin)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each flag can be repeated. See the section on <a href="#how-filter-rules-work">how filter rules are applied</a> for more details - these flags work in an identical way to the file name filtering flags, but instead of file name patterns have metadata patterns.</p>
<h2 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h2>
<p>The most frequent filter support issues on the <a href="https://forum.rclone.org/">rclone forum</a> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not using paths relative to the root of the remote</li>
<li>Not using <code>/</code> to match from the root of a remote</li>
<li>Not using <code>**</code> to match the contents of a directory</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="gui-experimental">GUI (Experimental)</h1>
<p>Rclone can serve a web based GUI (graphical user interface). This is somewhat experimental at the moment so things may be subject to change.</p>
<p>Run this command in a terminal and rclone will download and then display the GUI in a web browser.</p>
<pre><code>rclone rcd --rc-web-gui</code></pre>
<p>This will produce logs like this and rclone needs to continue to run to serve the GUI:</p>
<pre><code>2019/08/25 11:40:14 NOTICE: A new release for gui is present at https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react/releases/download/v0.0.6/currentbuild.zip
2019/08/25 11:40:14 NOTICE: Downloading webgui binary. Please wait. [Size: 3813937, Path :  /home/USER/.cache/rclone/webgui/v0.0.6.zip]

2019/08/25 11:40:16 NOTICE: Serving remote control on http://127.0.0.1:5572/</code></pre>
<p>This assumes you are running rclone locally on your machine. It is possible to separate the rclone and the GUI - see below for details.</p>
<p>If you wish to check for updates then you can add <code>--rc-web-gui-update</code> to the command line.</p>
<p>If you find your GUI broken, you may force it to update by add <code>--rc-web-gui-force-update</code>.</p>
<p>By default, rclone will open your browser. Add <code>--rc-web-gui-no-open-browser</code> to disable this feature.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-gui">Using the GUI</h2>
<p>Once the GUI opens, you will be looking at the dashboard which has an overall overview.</p>
<p>On the left hand side you will see a series of view buttons you can click on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dashboard - main overview</li>
<li>Configs - examine and create new configurations</li>
<li>Explorer - view, download and upload files to the cloud storage systems</li>
<li>Backend - view or alter the backend config</li>
<li>Log out</li>
</ul>
<p>(More docs and walkthrough video to come!)</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works-1">How it works</h2>
<p>When you run the <code>rclone rcd --rc-web-gui</code> this is what happens</p>
<ul>
<li>Rclone starts but only runs the remote control API ("rc").</li>
<li>The API is bound to localhost with an auto-generated username and password.</li>
<li>If the API bundle is missing then rclone will download it.</li>
<li>rclone will start serving the files from the API bundle over the same port as the API</li>
<li>rclone will open the browser with a <code>login_token</code> so it can log straight in.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advanced-use">Advanced use</h2>
<p>The <code>rclone rcd</code> may use any of the <a href="https://rclone.org/rc/#supported-parameters">flags documented on the rc page</a>.</p>
<p>The flag <code>--rc-web-gui</code> is shorthand for</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the web GUI if necessary</li>
<li>Check we are using some authentication</li>
<li><code>--rc-user gui</code></li>
<li><code>--rc-pass &lt;random password&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>--rc-serve</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These flags can be overridden as desired.</p>
<p>See also the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rcd/">rclone rcd documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="example-running-a-public-gui">Example: Running a public GUI</h3>
<p>For example the GUI could be served on a public port over SSL using an htpasswd file using the following flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--rc-web-gui</code></li>
<li><code>--rc-addr :443</code></li>
<li><code>--rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd</code></li>
<li><code>--rc-cert /path/to/ssl.crt</code></li>
<li><code>--rc-key /path/to/ssl.key</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-running-a-gui-behind-a-proxy">Example: Running a GUI behind a proxy</h3>
<p>If you want to run the GUI behind a proxy at <code>/rclone</code> you could use these flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--rc-web-gui</code></li>
<li><code>--rc-baseurl rclone</code></li>
<li><code>--rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Or instead of htpasswd if you just want a single user and password:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--rc-user me</code></li>
<li><code>--rc-pass mypassword</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<p>The GUI is being developed in the: <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react">rclone/rclone-webui-react repository</a>.</p>
<p>Bug reports and contributions are very welcome :-)</p>

<h1 id="remote-controlling-rclone-with-its-api">Remote controlling rclone with its API</h1>
<p>If rclone is run with the <code>--rc</code> flag then it starts an HTTP server which can be used to remote control rclone using its API.</p>
<p>You can either use the <a href="#api-rc">rc</a> command to access the API or <a href="#api-http">use HTTP directly</a>.</p>

<p>By default rclone will require authorisation to have been set up on the rc interface in order to use any methods which access any rclone remotes. Eg <code>operations/list</code> is denied as it involved creating a remote as is <code>sync/copy</code>.</p>
<p>If this is set then no authorisation will be required on the server to use these methods. The alternative is to use <code>--rc-user</code> and <code>--rc-pass</code> and use these credentials in the request.</p>
<p>Default Off.</p>
<h3 id="rc-baseurl">--rc-baseurl</h3>
<p>Prefix for URLs.</p>
<p>Default is root</p>
<h3 id="rc-template">--rc-template</h3>
<p>User-specified template.</p>
<h2 id="api-rc">Accessing the remote control via the rclone rc command</h2>
<p>Rclone itself implements the remote control protocol in its <code>rclone rc</code> command.</p>
<p>You can use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone rc rc/noop param1=one param2=two
{
    &quot;param1&quot;: &quot;one&quot;,
    &quot;param2&quot;: &quot;two&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>If the remote is running on a different URL than the default <code>http://localhost:5572/</code>, use the <code>--url</code> option to specify it:</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone rc --url http://some.remote:1234/ rc/noop</code></pre>
<p>Or, if the remote is listening on a Unix socket, use the <code>--unix-socket</code> option instead:</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone rc --unix-socket /tmp/rclone.sock rc/noop</code></pre>
<p>Run <code>rclone rc</code> on its own, without any commands, to see the help for the installed remote control commands. Note that this also needs to connect to the remote server.</p>
<h2 id="json-input">JSON input</h2>
<p><code>rclone rc</code> also supports a <code>--json</code> flag which can be used to send more complicated input parameters.</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone rc --json &#39;{ &quot;p1&quot;: [1,&quot;2&quot;,null,4], &quot;p2&quot;: { &quot;a&quot;:1, &quot;b&quot;:2 } }&#39; rc/noop
{
    &quot;p1&quot;: [
        1,
        &quot;2&quot;,
        null,
        4
    ],
    &quot;p2&quot;: {
        &quot;a&quot;: 1,
        &quot;b&quot;: 2
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>If the parameter being passed is an object then it can be passed as a JSON string rather than using the <code>--json</code> flag which simplifies the command line.</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc operations/list fs=/tmp remote=test opt=&#39;{&quot;showHash&quot;: true}&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Rather than</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc operations/list --json &#39;{&quot;fs&quot;: &quot;/tmp&quot;, &quot;remote&quot;: &quot;test&quot;, &quot;opt&quot;: {&quot;showHash&quot;: true}}&#39;</code></pre>
<h2 id="special-parameters">Special parameters</h2>
<p>The rc interface supports some special parameters which apply to <strong>all</strong> commands. These start with <code>_</code> to show they are different.</p>
<h3 id="running-asynchronous-jobs-with-_async-true">Running asynchronous jobs with _async = true</h3>
<p>Each rc call is classified as a job and it is assigned its own id. By default jobs are executed immediately as they are created or synchronously.</p>
<p>If <code>_async</code> has a true value when supplied to an rc call then it will return immediately with a job id and the task will be run in the background. The <code>job/status</code> call can be used to get information of the background job. The job can be queried for up to 1 minute after it has finished.</p>
<p>It is recommended that potentially long running jobs, e.g. <code>sync/sync</code>, <code>sync/copy</code>, <code>sync/move</code>, <code>operations/purge</code> are run with the <code>_async</code> flag to avoid any potential problems with the HTTP request and response timing out.</p>
<p>Starting a job with the <code>_async</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone rc --json &#39;{ &quot;p1&quot;: [1,&quot;2&quot;,null,4], &quot;p2&quot;: { &quot;a&quot;:1, &quot;b&quot;:2 }, &quot;_async&quot;: true }&#39; rc/noop
{
    &quot;jobid&quot;: 2
}</code></pre>
<p>Query the status to see if the job has finished. For more information on the meaning of these return parameters see the <code>job/status</code> call.</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone rc --json &#39;{ &quot;jobid&quot;:2 }&#39; job/status

<ul>
<li><code>Duration</code> - these are returned as an integer duration in nanoseconds. They may be set as an integer, or they may be set with time string, eg "5s". See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#options">options section</a> for more info.</li>
<li><code>Size</code> - these are returned as an integer number of bytes. They may be set as an integer or they may be set with a size suffix string, eg "10M". See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#options">options section</a> for more info.</li>
<li>Enumerated type (such as <code>CutoffMode</code>, <code>DumpFlags</code>, <code>LogLevel</code>, <code>VfsCacheMode</code> - these will be returned as an integer and may be set as an integer but more conveniently they can be set as a string, eg "HARD" for <code>CutoffMode</code> or <code>DEBUG</code> for <code>LogLevel</code>.</li>
<li><code>BandwidthSpec</code> - this will be set and returned as a string, eg "1M".</li>

<h2 id="specifying-remotes-to-work-on">Specifying remotes to work on</h2>
<p>Remotes are specified with the <code>fs=</code>, <code>srcFs=</code>, <code>dstFs=</code> parameters depending on the command being used.</p>
<p>The parameters can be a string as per the rest of rclone, eg <code>s3:bucket/path</code> or <code>:sftp:/my/dir</code>. They can also be specified as JSON blobs.</p>
<p>If specifying a JSON blob it should be a object mapping strings to strings. These values will be used to configure the remote. There are 3 special values which may be set:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>type</code> - set to <code>type</code> to specify a remote called <code>:type:</code></li>
<li><code>_name</code> - set to <code>name</code> to specify a remote called <code>name:</code></li>
<li><code>_root</code> - sets the root of the remote - may be empty</li>
</ul>
<p>One of <code>_name</code> or <code>type</code> should normally be set. If the <code>local</code> backend is desired then <code>type</code> should be set to <code>local</code>. If <code>_root</code> isn't specified then it defaults to the root of the remote.</p>
<p>For example this JSON is equivalent to <code>remote:/tmp</code></p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;_name&quot;: &quot;remote&quot;,
    &quot;_root&quot;: &quot;/tmp&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>And this is equivalent to <code>:sftp,host='example.com':/tmp</code></p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sftp&quot;,
    &quot;host&quot;: &quot;example.com&quot;,
    &quot;_root&quot;: &quot;/tmp&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>And this is equivalent to <code>/tmp/dir</code></p>
<pre><code>{
    type = &quot;local&quot;,
    _root = &quot;/tmp/dir&quot;
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="supported-commands">Supported commands</h2>

<li>arg - a list of arguments for the backend command</li>
<li>opt - a map of string to string of options</li>
</ul>
<p>Returns:</p>
<ul>
<li>result - result from the backend command</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc backend/command command=noop fs=. -o echo=yes -o blue -a path1 -a path2</code></pre>
<p>Returns</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;result&quot;: {

<h3 id="cache-expire">cache/expire: Purge a remote from cache</h3>
<p>Purge a remote from the cache backend. Supports either a directory or a file. Params: - remote = path to remote (required) - withData = true/false to delete cached data (chunks) as well (optional)</p>

<pre><code>rclone rc cache/expire remote=path/to/sub/folder/
rclone rc cache/expire remote=/ withData=true</code></pre>
<h3 id="cache-fetch">cache/fetch: Fetch file chunks</h3>
<p>Ensure the specified file chunks are cached on disk.</p>
<p>The chunks= parameter specifies the file chunks to check. It takes a comma separated list of array slice indices. The slice indices are similar to Python slices: start[:end]</p>
<p>start is the 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the file to fetch inclusive. end is 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the file to fetch exclusive. Both values can be negative, in which case they count from the back of the file. The value "-5:" represents the last 5 chunks of a file.</p>
<p>Some valid examples are: ":5,-5:" -&gt; the first and last five chunks "0,-2" -&gt; the first and the second last chunk "0:10" -&gt; the first ten chunks</p>
<p>Any parameter with a key that starts with "file" can be used to specify files to fetch, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc cache/fetch chunks=0 file=hello file2=home/goodbye</code></pre>
<p>File names will automatically be encrypted when the a crypt remote is used on top of the cache.</p>

<h3 id="debug-set-block-profile-rate">debug/set-block-profile-rate: Set runtime.SetBlockProfileRate for blocking profiling.</h3>
<p>SetBlockProfileRate controls the fraction of goroutine blocking events that are reported in the blocking profile. The profiler aims to sample an average of one blocking event per rate nanoseconds spent blocked.</p>
<p>To include every blocking event in the profile, pass rate = 1. To turn off profiling entirely, pass rate &lt;= 0.</p>
<p>After calling this you can use this to see the blocking profile:</p>
<pre><code>go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/block</code></pre>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>rate - int</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="debug-set-gc-percent">debug/set-gc-percent: Call runtime/debug.SetGCPercent for setting the garbage collection target percentage.</h3>
<p>SetGCPercent sets the garbage collection target percentage: a collection is triggered when the ratio of freshly allocated data to live data remaining after the previous collection reaches this percentage. SetGCPercent returns the previous setting. The initial setting is the value of the GOGC environment variable at startup, or 100 if the variable is not set.</p>
<p>This setting may be effectively reduced in order to maintain a memory limit. A negative percentage effectively disables garbage collection, unless the memory limit is reached.</p>
<p>See https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/debug#SetMemoryLimit for more details.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>gc-percent - int</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="debug-set-mutex-profile-fraction">debug/set-mutex-profile-fraction: Set runtime.SetMutexProfileFraction for mutex profiling.</h3>
<p>SetMutexProfileFraction controls the fraction of mutex contention events that are reported in the mutex profile. On average 1/rate events are reported. The previous rate is returned.</p>
<p>To turn off profiling entirely, pass rate 0. To just read the current rate, pass rate &lt; 0. (For n&gt;1 the details of sampling may change.)</p>
<p>Once this is set you can look use this to profile the mutex contention:</p>
<pre><code>go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/mutex</code></pre>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>rate - int</li>
</ul>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>previousRate - int</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="debug-set-soft-memory-limit">debug/set-soft-memory-limit: Call runtime/debug.SetMemoryLimit for setting a soft memory limit for the runtime.</h3>
<p>SetMemoryLimit provides the runtime with a soft memory limit.</p>
<p>The runtime undertakes several processes to try to respect this memory limit, including adjustments to the frequency of garbage collections and returning memory to the underlying system more aggressively. This limit will be respected even if GOGC=off (or, if SetGCPercent(-1) is executed).</p>
<p>The input limit is provided as bytes, and includes all memory mapped, managed, and not released by the Go runtime. Notably, it does not account for space used by the Go binary and memory external to Go, such as memory managed by the underlying system on behalf of the process, or memory managed by non-Go code inside the same process. Examples of excluded memory sources include: OS kernel memory held on behalf of the process, memory allocated by C code, and memory mapped by syscall.Mmap (because it is not managed by the Go runtime).</p>
<p>A zero limit or a limit that's lower than the amount of memory used by the Go runtime may cause the garbage collector to run nearly continuously. However, the application may still make progress.</p>
<p>The memory limit is always respected by the Go runtime, so to effectively disable this behavior, set the limit very high. math.MaxInt64 is the canonical value for disabling the limit, but values much greater than the available memory on the underlying system work just as well.</p>
<p>See https://go.dev/doc/gc-guide for a detailed guide explaining the soft memory limit in more detail, as well as a variety of common use-cases and scenarios.</p>
<p>SetMemoryLimit returns the previously set memory limit. A negative input does not adjust the limit, and allows for retrieval of the currently set memory limit.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>mem-limit - int</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fscache-clear">fscache/clear: Clear the Fs cache.</h3>

<h3 id="operations-hashsum">operations/hashsum: Produces a hashsum file for all the objects in the path.</h3>
<p>Produces a hash file for all the objects in the path using the hash named. The output is in the same format as the standard md5sum/sha1sum tool.</p>
<p>This takes the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>fs - a remote name string e.g. "drive:" for the source, "/" for local filesystem
<ul>
<li>this can point to a file and just that file will be returned in the listing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>hashType - type of hash to be used</li>
<li>download - check by downloading rather than with hash (boolean)</li>
<li>base64 - output the hashes in base64 rather than hex (boolean)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you supply the download flag, it will download the data from the remote and create the hash on the fly. This can be useful for remotes that don't support the given hash or if you really want to check all the data.</p>
<p>Note that if you wish to supply a checkfile to check hashes against the current files then you should use operations/check instead of operations/hashsum.</p>
<p>Returns:</p>
<ul>
<li>hashsum - array of strings of the hashes</li>
<li>hashType - type of hash used</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone rc --loopback operations/hashsum fs=bin hashType=MD5 download=true base64=true

<h3 id="serve-start">serve/start: Create a new server</h3>
<p>Create a new server with the specified parameters.</p>
<p>This takes the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>type</code> - type of server: <code>http</code>, <code>webdav</code>, <code>ftp</code>, <code>sftp</code>, <code>nfs</code>, etc.</li>
<li><code>fs</code> - remote storage path to serve</li>
<li><code>addr</code> - the ip:port to run the server on, eg ":1234" or "localhost:1234"</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="vfs-forget">vfs/forget: Forget files or directories in the directory cache.</h3>
<p>This forgets the paths in the directory cache causing them to be re-read from the remote when needed.</p>
<p>If no paths are passed in then it will forget all the paths in the directory cache.</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise pass files or dirs in as file=path or dir=path. Any parameter key starting with file will forget that file and any starting with dir will forget that dir, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/forget file=hello file2=goodbye dir=home/junk</code></pre>
<p>This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter must be supplied.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-list">vfs/list: List active VFSes.</h3>
<p>This lists the active VFSes.</p>
<p>It returns a list under the key "vfses" where the values are the VFS names that could be passed to the other VFS commands in the "fs" parameter.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-poll-interval">vfs/poll-interval: Get the status or update the value of the poll-interval option.</h3>
<p>Without any parameter given this returns the current status of the poll-interval setting.</p>
<p>When the interval=duration parameter is set, the poll-interval value is updated and the polling function is notified. Setting interval=0 disables poll-interval.</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/poll-interval interval=5m</code></pre>
<p>The timeout=duration parameter can be used to specify a time to wait for the current poll function to apply the new value. If timeout is less or equal 0, which is the default, wait indefinitely.</p>
<p>The new poll-interval value will only be active when the timeout is not reached.</p>
<p>If poll-interval is updated or disabled temporarily, some changes might not get picked up by the polling function, depending on the used remote.</p>
<p>This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter must be supplied.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-queue">vfs/queue: Queue info for a VFS.</h3>
<p>This returns info about the upload queue for the selected VFS.</p>
<p>This is only useful if <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> &gt; off. If you call it when the <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> is off, it will return an empty result.</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;queued&quot;: // an array of files queued for upload
    [
        {
            &quot;name&quot;:      &quot;file&quot;,   // string: name (full path) of the file,
            &quot;id&quot;:        123,      // integer: id of this item in the queue,
            &quot;size&quot;:      79,       // integer: size of the file in bytes
            &quot;expiry&quot;:    1.5       // float: time until file is eligible for transfer, lowest goes first
            &quot;tries&quot;:     1,        // integer: number of times we have tried to upload
            &quot;delay&quot;:     5.0,      // float: seconds between upload attempts
            &quot;uploading&quot;: false,    // boolean: true if item is being uploaded
        },
   ],
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>expiry</code> time is the time until the file is eligible for being uploaded in floating point seconds. This may go negative. As rclone only transfers <code>--transfers</code> files at once, only the lowest <code>--transfers</code> expiry times will have <code>uploading</code> as <code>true</code>. So there may be files with negative expiry times for which <code>uploading</code> is <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter must be supplied.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-queue-set-expiry">vfs/queue-set-expiry: Set the expiry time for an item queued for upload.</h3>
<p>Use this to adjust the <code>expiry</code> time for an item in the upload queue. You will need to read the <code>id</code> of the item using <code>vfs/queue</code> before using this call.</p>
<p>You can then set <code>expiry</code> to a floating point number of seconds from now when the item is eligible for upload. If you want the item to be uploaded as soon as possible then set it to a large negative number (eg -1000000000). If you want the upload of the item to be delayed for a long time then set it to a large positive number.</p>
<p>Setting the <code>expiry</code> of an item which has already has started uploading will have no effect - the item will carry on being uploaded.</p>
<p>This will return an error if called with <code>--vfs-cache-mode</code> off or if the <code>id</code> passed is not found.</p>
<p>This takes the following parameters</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fs</code> - select the VFS in use (optional)</li>
<li><code>id</code> - a numeric ID as returned from <code>vfs/queue</code></li>
<li><code>expiry</code> - a new expiry time as floating point seconds</li>
<li><code>relative</code> - if set, expiry is to be treated as relative to the current expiry (optional, boolean)</li>
</ul>
<p>This returns an empty result on success, or an error.</p>
<p>This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter must be supplied.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-refresh">vfs/refresh: Refresh the directory cache.</h3>
<p>This reads the directories for the specified paths and freshens the directory cache.</p>
<p>If no paths are passed in then it will refresh the root directory.</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/refresh</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise pass directories in as dir=path. Any parameter key starting with dir will refresh that directory, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>rclone rc vfs/refresh dir=home/junk dir2=data/misc</code></pre>
<p>If the parameter recursive=true is given the whole directory tree will get refreshed. This refresh will use --fast-list if enabled.</p>
<p>This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter must be supplied.</p>
<h3 id="vfs-stats">vfs/stats: Stats for a VFS.</h3>
<p>This returns stats for the selected VFS.</p>
<pre><code>{
    // Status of the disk cache - only present if --vfs-cache-mode &gt; off
    &quot;diskCache&quot;: {
        &quot;bytesUsed&quot;: 0,

    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter must be supplied.</p>
<h2 id="api-http">Accessing the remote control via HTTP</h2>
<p>Rclone implements a simple HTTP based protocol.</p>
<p>Each endpoint takes an JSON object and returns a JSON object or an error. The JSON objects are essentially a map of string names to values.</p>
<p>All calls must made using POST.</p>
<p>The input objects can be supplied using URL parameters, POST parameters or by supplying "Content-Type: application/json" and a JSON blob in the body. There are examples of these below using <code>curl</code>.</p>
<p>The response will be a JSON blob in the body of the response. This is formatted to be reasonably human-readable.</p>
<h3 id="error-returns">Error returns</h3>
<p>If an error occurs then there will be an HTTP error status (e.g. 500) and the body of the response will contain a JSON encoded error object, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;error&quot;: &quot;Expecting string value for key \&quot;remote\&quot; (was float64)&quot;,
    &quot;input&quot;: {
        &quot;fs&quot;: &quot;/tmp&quot;,
        &quot;remote&quot;: 3
    },
    &quot;status&quot;: 400
    &quot;path&quot;: &quot;operations/rmdir&quot;,
}</code></pre>
<p>The keys in the error response are - error - error string - input - the input parameters to the call - status - the HTTP status code - path - the path of the call</p>
<h3 id="cors">CORS</h3>
<p>The sever implements basic CORS support and allows all origins for that. The response to a preflight OPTIONS request will echo the requested "Access-Control-Request-Headers" back.</p>
<h3 id="using-post-with-url-parameters-only">Using POST with URL parameters only</h3>

<h3 id="debugging-go-routine-leaks">Debugging go routine leaks</h3>
<p>Memory leaks are most often caused by go routine leaks keeping memory alive which should have been garbage collected.</p>
<p>See all active go routines using</p>
<pre><code>curl http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1</code></pre>
<p>Or go to http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1 in your browser.</p>
<h3 id="other-profiles-to-look-at">Other profiles to look at</h3>
<p>You can see a summary of profiles available at http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/</p>
<p>Here is how to use some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memory: <code>go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap</code></li>
<li>Go routines: <code>curl http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1</code></li>
<li>30-second CPU profile: <code>go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/profile</code></li>
<li>5-second execution trace: <code>wget http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/trace?seconds=5</code></li>
<li>Goroutine blocking profile
<ul>
<li>Enable first with: <code>rclone rc debug/set-block-profile-rate rate=1</code> (<a href="#debug-set-block-profile-rate">docs</a>)</li>
<li><code>go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/block</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Contended mutexes:
<ul>
<li>Enable first with: <code>rclone rc debug/set-mutex-profile-fraction rate=1</code> (<a href="#debug-set-mutex-profile-fraction">docs</a>)</li>
<li><code>go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/mutex</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/">net/http/pprof docs</a> for more info on how to use the profiling and for a general overview see <a href="https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs">the Go team's blog post on profiling go programs</a>.</p>
<p>The profiling hook is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/26545159/164234">zero overhead unless it is used</a>.</p>

<p>¹ Dropbox supports <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/content-hash">its own custom hash</a>. This is an SHA256 sum of all the 4 MiB block SHA256s.</p>
<p>² SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and <code>md5sum</code> or <code>sha1sum</code> as well as <code>echo</code> are in the remote's PATH.</p>
<p>³ WebDAV supports hashes when used with Fastmail Files, Owncloud and Nextcloud only.</p>
<p>⁴ WebDAV supports modtimes when used with Fastmail Files, Owncloud and Nextcloud only.</p>
<p>⁵ <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/code-snippets/quickxorhash">QuickXorHash</a> is Microsoft's own hash.</p>
<p>⁶ Mail.ru uses its own modified SHA1 hash</p>
<p>⁷ pCloud only supports SHA1 (not MD5) in its EU region</p>
<p>⁸ Opendrive does not support creation of duplicate files using their web client interface or other stock clients, but the underlying storage platform has been determined to allow duplicate files, and it is possible to create them with <code>rclone</code>. It may be that this is a mistake or an unsupported feature.</p>
<p>⁹ QingStor does not support SetModTime for objects bigger than 5 GiB.</p>
<p>¹⁰ FTP supports modtimes for the major FTP servers, and also others if they advertised required protocol extensions. See <a href="https://rclone.org/ftp/#modification-times">this</a> for more details.</p>
<p>¹¹ Internet Archive requires option <code>wait_archive</code> to be set to a non-zero value for full modtime support.</p>
<p>¹² HiDrive supports <a href="https://static.hidrive.com/dev/0001">its own custom hash</a>. It combines SHA1 sums for each 4 KiB block hierarchically to a single top-level sum.</p>
<p>¹³ Uloz.to provides server-calculated MD5 hash upon file upload. MD5 and SHA256 hashes are client-calculated and stored as metadata fields.</p>
<h3 id="hash">Hash</h3>
<p>The cloud storage system supports various hash types of the objects. The hashes are used when transferring data as an integrity check and can be specifically used with the <code>--checksum</code> flag in syncs and in the <code>check</code> command.</p>
<p>To use the verify checksums when transferring between cloud storage systems they must support a common hash type.</p>
<h3 id="modtime">ModTime</h3>
<p>Almost all cloud storage systems store some sort of timestamp on objects, but several of them not something that is appropriate to use for syncing. E.g. some backends will only write a timestamp that represents the time of the upload. To be relevant for syncing it should be able to store the modification time of the source object. If this is not the case, rclone will only check the file size by default, though can be configured to check the file hash (with the <code>--checksum</code> flag). Ideally it should also be possible to change the timestamp of an existing file without having to re-upload it.</p>

<p>Storage systems with a <code>-</code> in the ModTime column, means the modification read on objects is not the modification time of the file when uploaded. It is most likely the time the file was uploaded, or possibly something else (like the time the picture was taken in Google Photos).</p>
<p>Storage systems with a <code>R</code> (for read-only) in the ModTime column, means the it keeps modification times on objects, and updates them when uploading objects, but it does not support changing only the modification time (<code>SetModTime</code> operation) without re-uploading, possibly not even without deleting existing first. Some operations in rclone, such as <code>copy</code> and <code>sync</code> commands, will automatically check for <code>SetModTime</code> support and re-upload if necessary to keep the modification times in sync. Other commands will not work without <code>SetModTime</code> support, e.g. <code>touch</code> command on an existing file will fail, and changes to modification time only on a files in a <code>mount</code> will be silently ignored.</p>
<p>Storage systems with <code>R/W</code> (for read/write) in the ModTime column, means they do also support modtime-only operations.</p>
<p>Storage systems with <code>D</code> in the ModTime column means that the following symbols apply to directories as well as files.</p>
<h3 id="case-insensitive">Case Insensitive</h3>
<p>If a cloud storage systems is case sensitive then it is possible to have two files which differ only in case, e.g. <code>file.txt</code> and <code>FILE.txt</code>. If a cloud storage system is case insensitive then that isn't possible.</p>
<p>This can cause problems when syncing between a case insensitive system and a case sensitive system. The symptom of this is that no matter how many times you run the sync it never completes fully.</p>
<p>The local filesystem and SFTP may or may not be case sensitive depending on OS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows - usually case insensitive, though case is preserved</li>
<li>OSX - usually case insensitive, though it is possible to format case sensitive</li>
<li>Linux - usually case sensitive, but there are case insensitive file systems (e.g. FAT formatted USB keys)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time this doesn't cause any problems as people tend to avoid files whose name differs only by case even on case sensitive systems.</p>
<h3 id="duplicate-files">Duplicate files</h3>
<p>If a cloud storage system allows duplicate files then it can have two objects with the same name.</p>
<p>This confuses rclone greatly when syncing - use the <code>rclone dedupe</code> command to rename or remove duplicates.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-filenames">Restricted filenames</h3>
<p>Some cloud storage systems might have restrictions on the characters that are usable in file or directory names. When <code>rclone</code> detects such a name during a file upload, it will transparently replace the restricted characters with similar looking Unicode characters. To handle the different sets of restricted characters for different backends, rclone uses something it calls <a href="#encoding">encoding</a>.</p>
<p>This process is designed to avoid ambiguous file names as much as possible and allow to move files between many cloud storage systems transparently.</p>
<p>The name shown by <code>rclone</code> to the user or during log output will only contain a minimal set of <a href="#restricted-characters">replaced characters</a> to ensure correct formatting and not necessarily the actual name used on the cloud storage.</p>
<p>This transformation is reversed when downloading a file or parsing <code>rclone</code> arguments. For example, when uploading a file named <code>my file?.txt</code> to Onedrive, it will be displayed as <code>my file?.txt</code> on the console, but stored as <code>my file？.txt</code> to Onedrive (the <code>?</code> gets replaced by the similar looking <code>？</code> character, the so-called "fullwidth question mark"). The reverse transformation allows to read a file <code>unusual/name.txt</code> from Google Drive, by passing the name <code>unusual／name.txt</code> on the command line (the <code>/</code> needs to be replaced by the similar looking <code>／</code> character).</p>
<h4 id="restricted-filenames-caveats">Caveats</h4>
<p>The filename encoding system works well in most cases, at least where file names are written in English or similar languages. You might not even notice it: It just works. In some cases it may lead to issues, though. E.g. when file names are written in Chinese, or Japanese, where it is always the Unicode fullwidth variants of the punctuation marks that are used.</p>
<p>On Windows, the characters <code>:</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>?</code> are examples of restricted characters. If these are used in filenames on a remote that supports it, Rclone will transparently convert them to their fullwidth Unicode variants <code>＊</code>, <code>？</code> and <code>：</code> when downloading to Windows, and back again when uploading. This way files with names that are not allowed on Windows can still be stored.</p>
<p>However, if you have files on your Windows system originally with these same Unicode characters in their names, they will be included in the same conversion process. E.g. if you create a file in your Windows filesystem with name <code>Test：1.jpg</code>, where <code>：</code> is the Unicode fullwidth colon symbol, and use rclone to upload it to Google Drive, which supports regular <code>:</code> (halfwidth question mark), rclone will replace the fullwidth <code>:</code> with the halfwidth <code>:</code> and store the file as <code>Test:1.jpg</code> in Google Drive. Since both Windows and Google Drive allows the name <code>Test：1.jpg</code>, it would probably be better if rclone just kept the name as is in this case.</p>
<p>With the opposite situation; if you have a file named <code>Test:1.jpg</code>, in your Google Drive, e.g. uploaded from a Linux system where <code>:</code> is valid in file names. Then later use rclone to copy this file to your Windows computer you will notice that on your local disk it gets renamed to <code>Test：1.jpg</code>. The original filename is not legal on Windows, due to the <code>:</code>, and rclone therefore renames it to make the copy possible. That is all good. However, this can also lead to an issue: If you already had a <em>different</em> file named <code>Test：1.jpg</code> on Windows, and then use rclone to copy either way. Rclone will then treat the file originally named <code>Test:1.jpg</code> on Google Drive and the file originally named <code>Test：1.jpg</code> on Windows as the same file, and replace the contents from one with the other.</p>
<p>Its virtually impossible to handle all cases like these correctly in all situations, but by customizing the <a href="#encoding">encoding option</a>, changing the set of characters that rclone should convert, you should be able to create a configuration that works well for your specific situation. See also the <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding-example-windows">example</a> below.</p>
<p>(Windows was used as an example of a file system with many restricted characters, and Google drive a storage system with few.)</p>
<h4 id="restricted-characters">Default restricted characters</h4>
<p>The table below shows the characters that are replaced by default.</p>
<p>When a replacement character is found in a filename, this character will be escaped with the <code>‛</code> character to avoid ambiguous file names. (e.g. a file named <code>␀.txt</code> would shown as <code>‛␀.txt</code>)</p>
<p>Each cloud storage backend can use a different set of characters, which will be specified in the documentation for each backend.</p>

<h4 id="invalid-utf8">Invalid UTF-8 bytes</h4>
<p>Some backends only support a sequence of well formed UTF-8 bytes as file or directory names.</p>
<p>In this case all invalid UTF-8 bytes will be replaced with a quoted representation of the byte value to allow uploading a file to such a backend. For example, the invalid byte <code>0xFE</code> will be encoded as <code>‛FE</code>.</p>
<p>A common source of invalid UTF-8 bytes are local filesystems, that store names in a different encoding than UTF-8 or UTF-16, like latin1. See the <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#filenames">local filenames</a> section for details.</p>
<h4 id="encoding">Encoding option</h4>
<p>Most backends have an encoding option, specified as a flag <code>--backend-encoding</code> where <code>backend</code> is the name of the backend, or as a config parameter <code>encoding</code> (you'll need to select the Advanced config in <code>rclone config</code> to see it).</p>
<p>This will have default value which encodes and decodes characters in such a way as to preserve the maximum number of characters (see above).</p>
<p>However this can be incorrect in some scenarios, for example if you have a Windows file system with Unicode fullwidth characters <code>＊</code>, <code>？</code> or <code>：</code>, that you want to remain as those characters on the remote rather than being translated to regular (halfwidth) <code>*</code>, <code>?</code> and <code>:</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>--backend-encoding</code> flags allow you to change that. You can disable the encoding completely with <code>--backend-encoding Raw</code> or set <code>encoding = Raw</code> in the config file.</p>
<p>Encoding takes a comma separated list of encodings. You can see the list of all possible values by passing an invalid value to this flag, e.g. <code>--local-encoding "help"</code>. The command <code>rclone help flags encoding</code> will show you the defaults for the backends.</p>

<p>¹ Encoding from NUL 0x00 to ␀ is always implicit except when using Raw. It was previously incorrectly documented as disabling encoding, and to maintain backward compatibility, its behavior has not been changed.</p>
<h5 id="encoding-example-ftp">Encoding example: FTP</h5>
<p>To take a specific example, the FTP backend's default encoding is</p>
<pre><code>--ftp-encoding &quot;Slash,Del,Ctl,RightSpace,Dot&quot;</code></pre>
<p>However, let's say the FTP server is running on Windows and can't have any of the invalid Windows characters in file names. You are backing up Linux servers to this FTP server which do have those characters in file names. So you would add the Windows set which are</p>
<pre><code>Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot</code></pre>
<p>to the existing ones, giving:</p>
<pre><code>Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot,Del,RightSpace</code></pre>
<p>This can be specified using the <code>--ftp-encoding</code> flag or using an <code>encoding</code> parameter in the config file.</p>
<h5 id="encoding-example-windows">Encoding example: Windows</h5>
<p>As a nother example, take a Windows system where there is a file with name <code>Test：1.jpg</code>, where <code>：</code> is the Unicode fullwidth colon symbol. When using rclone to copy this to a remote which supports <code>:</code>, the regular (halfwidth) colon (such as Google Drive), you will notice that the file gets renamed to <code>Test:1.jpg</code>.</p>
<p>To avoid this you can change the set of characters rclone should convert for the local filesystem, using command-line argument <code>--local-encoding</code>. Rclone's default behavior on Windows corresponds to</p>
<pre><code>--local-encoding &quot;Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If you want to use fullwidth characters <code>：</code>, <code>＊</code> and <code>？</code> in your filenames without rclone changing them when uploading to a remote, then set the same as the default value but without <code>Colon,Question,Asterisk</code>:</p>
<pre><code>--local-encoding &quot;Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can disable the conversion of any characters with <code>--local-encoding Raw</code>.</p>
<p>Instead of using command-line argument <code>--local-encoding</code>, you may also set it as <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#environment-variables">environment variable</a> <code>RCLONE_LOCAL_ENCODING</code>, or <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#configure">configure</a> a remote of type <code>local</code> in your config, and set the <code>encoding</code> option there.</p>
<p>The risk by doing this is that if you have a filename with the regular (halfwidth) <code>:</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>?</code> in your cloud storage, and you try to download it to your Windows filesystem, this will fail. These characters are not valid in filenames on Windows, and you have told rclone not to work around this by converting them to valid fullwidth variants.</p>
<h3 id="mime-type">MIME Type</h3>
<p>MIME types (also known as media types) classify types of documents using a simple text classification, e.g. <code>text/html</code> or <code>application/pdf</code>.</p>
<p>Some cloud storage systems support reading (<code>R</code>) the MIME type of objects and some support writing (<code>W</code>) the MIME type of objects.</p>
<p>The MIME type can be important if you are serving files directly to HTTP from the storage system.</p>
<p>If you are copying from a remote which supports reading (<code>R</code>) to a remote which supports writing (<code>W</code>) then rclone will preserve the MIME types. Otherwise they will be guessed from the extension, or the remote itself may assign the MIME type.</p>
<h3 id="metadata-1">Metadata</h3>
<p>Backends may or may support reading or writing metadata. They may support reading and writing system metadata (metadata intrinsic to that backend) and/or user metadata (general purpose metadata).</p>

<p>¹ Note Swift implements this in order to delete directory markers but it doesn't actually have a quicker way of deleting files other than deleting them individually.</p>
<p>² Storj implements this efficiently only for entire buckets. If purging a directory inside a bucket, files are deleted individually.</p>
<p>³ StreamUpload is not supported with Nextcloud</p>
<p>⁴ Use the <code>--sftp-copy-is-hardlink</code> flag to enable.</p>
<p>⁵ Use the <code>--onedrive-delta</code> flag to enable.</p>
<h3 id="purge">Purge</h3>
<p>This deletes a directory quicker than just deleting all the files in the directory.</p>
<h3 id="copy">Copy</h3>
<p>Used when copying an object to and from the same remote. This known as a server-side copy so you can copy a file without downloading it and uploading it again. It is used if you use <code>rclone copy</code> or <code>rclone move</code> if the remote doesn't support <code>Move</code> directly.</p>
<p>If the server doesn't support <code>Copy</code> directly then for copy operations the file is downloaded then re-uploaded.</p>
<h3 id="move">Move</h3>
<p>Used when moving/renaming an object on the same remote. This is known as a server-side move of a file. This is used in <code>rclone move</code> if the server doesn't support <code>DirMove</code>.</p>
<p>If the server isn't capable of <code>Move</code> then rclone simulates it with <code>Copy</code> then delete. If the server doesn't support <code>Copy</code> then rclone will download the file and re-upload it.</p>
<h3 id="dirmove">DirMove</h3>
<p>This is used to implement <code>rclone move</code> to move a directory if possible. If it isn't then it will use <code>Move</code> on each file (which falls back to <code>Copy</code> then download and upload - see <code>Move</code> section).</p>
<h3 id="cleanup">CleanUp</h3>
<p>This is used for emptying the trash for a remote by <code>rclone cleanup</code>.</p>
<p>If the server can't do <code>CleanUp</code> then <code>rclone cleanup</code> will return an error.</p>
<p>‡‡ Note that while Box implements this it has to delete every file individually so it will be slower than emptying the trash via the WebUI</p>
<h3 id="listr">ListR</h3>
<p>The remote supports a recursive list to list all the contents beneath a directory quickly. This enables the <code>--fast-list</code> flag to work. See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list">rclone docs</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="streamupload">StreamUpload</h3>
<p>Some remotes allow files to be uploaded without knowing the file size in advance. This allows certain operations to work without spooling the file to local disk first, e.g. <code>rclone rcat</code>.</p>
<h3 id="multithreadupload">MultithreadUpload</h3>
<p>Some remotes allow transfers to the remote to be sent as chunks in parallel. If this is supported then rclone will use multi-thread copying to transfer files much faster.</p>
<h3 id="linksharing">LinkSharing</h3>
<p>Sets the necessary permissions on a file or folder and prints a link that allows others to access them, even if they don't have an account on the particular cloud provider.</p>
<h3 id="about-1">About</h3>
<p>Rclone <code>about</code> prints quota information for a remote. Typical output includes bytes used, free, quota and in trash.</p>
<p>If a remote lacks about capability <code>rclone about remote:</code>returns an error.</p>
<p>Backends without about capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount, or use policy <code>mfs</code> (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/">rclone about command</a></p>
<h3 id="emptydir">EmptyDir</h3>
<p>The remote supports empty directories. See <a href="https://rclone.org/bugs/#limitations">Limitations</a> for details. Most Object/Bucket-based remotes do not support this.</p>

<h1 id="docker-volume-plugin">Docker Volume Plugin</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Docker 1.9 has added support for creating <a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/">named volumes</a> via <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/">command-line interface</a> and mounting them in containers as a way to share data between them. Since Docker 1.10 you can create named volumes with <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a> by descriptions in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#volume-configuration-reference">docker-compose.yml</a> files for use by container groups on a single host. As of Docker 1.12 volumes are supported by <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/key-concepts/">Docker Swarm</a> included with Docker Engine and created from descriptions in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volume-configuration-reference">swarm compose v3</a> files for use with <em>swarm stacks</em> across multiple cluster nodes.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_volume/">Docker Volume Plugins</a> augment the default <code>local</code> volume driver included in Docker with stateful volumes shared across containers and hosts. Unlike local volumes, your data will <em>not</em> be deleted when such volume is removed. Plugins can run managed by the docker daemon, as a native system service (under systemd, <em>sysv</em> or <em>upstart</em>) or as a standalone executable. Rclone can run as docker volume plugin in all these modes. It interacts with the local docker daemon via <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugin_api/">plugin API</a> and handles mounting of remote file systems into docker containers so it must run on the same host as the docker daemon or on every Swarm node.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>In the first example we will use the <a href="https://rclone.org/sftp/">SFTP</a> rclone volume with Docker engine on a standalone Ubuntu machine.</p>
<p>Start from <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">installing Docker</a> on the host.</p>
<p>The <em>FUSE</em> driver is a prerequisite for rclone mounting and should be installed on host:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get -y install fuse3</code></pre>
<p>Create two directories required by rclone docker plugin:</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache</code></pre>
<p>Install the managed rclone docker plugin for your architecture (here <code>amd64</code>):</p>
<pre><code>docker plugin install rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64 args=&quot;-v&quot; --alias rclone --grant-all-permissions
docker plugin list</code></pre>
<p>Create your <a href="https://rclone.org/sftp/#standard-options">SFTP volume</a>:</p>
<pre><code>docker volume create firstvolume -d rclone -o type=sftp -o sftp-host=_hostname_ -o sftp-user=_username_ -o sftp-pass=_password_ -o allow-other=true</code></pre>
<p>Note that since all options are static, you don't even have to run <code>rclone config</code> or create the <code>rclone.conf</code> file (but the <code>config</code> directory should still be present). In the simplest case you can use <code>localhost</code> as <em>hostname</em> and your SSH credentials as <em>username</em> and <em>password</em>. You can also change the remote path to your home directory on the host, for example <code>-o path=/home/username</code>.</p>
<p>Time to create a test container and mount the volume into it:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --rm -it -v firstvolume:/mnt --workdir /mnt ubuntu:latest bash</code></pre>
<p>If all goes well, you will enter the new container and change right to the mounted SFTP remote. You can type <code>ls</code> to list the mounted directory or otherwise play with it. Type <code>exit</code> when you are done. The container will stop but the volume will stay, ready to be reused. When it's not needed anymore, remove it:</p>
<pre><code>docker volume list
docker volume remove firstvolume</code></pre>
<p>Now let us try <strong>something more elaborate</strong>: <a href="https://rclone.org/drive/">Google Drive</a> volume on multi-node Docker Swarm.</p>
<p>You should start from installing Docker and FUSE, creating plugin directories and installing rclone plugin on <em>every</em> swarm node. Then <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-mode/">setup the Swarm</a>.</p>
<p>Google Drive volumes need an access token which can be setup via web browser and will be periodically renewed by rclone. The managed plugin cannot run a browser so we will use a technique similar to the <a href="https://rclone.org/remote_setup/">rclone setup on a headless box</a>.</p>
<p>Run <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_create/">rclone config</a> on <em>another</em> machine equipped with <em>web browser</em> and graphical user interface. Create the <a href="https://rclone.org/drive/#standard-options">Google Drive remote</a>. When done, transfer the resulting <code>rclone.conf</code> to the Swarm cluster and save as <code>/var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config/rclone.conf</code> on <em>every</em> node. By default this location is accessible only to the root user so you will need appropriate privileges. The resulting config will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>[gdrive]
type = drive
scope = drive
drive_id = 1234567...
root_folder_id = 0Abcd...
token = {&quot;access_token&quot;:...}</code></pre>
<p>Now create the file named <code>example.yml</code> with a swarm stack description like this:</p>
<pre><code>version: &#39;3&#39;
services:
  heimdall:
    image: linuxserver/heimdall:latest
    ports: [8080:80]
    volumes: [configdata:/config]
volumes:
  configdata:
    driver: rclone
    driver_opts:
      remote: &#39;gdrive:heimdall&#39;
      allow_other: &#39;true&#39;
      vfs_cache_mode: full
      poll_interval: 0</code></pre>
<p>and run the stack:</p>
<pre><code>docker stack deploy example -c ./example.yml</code></pre>
<p>After a few seconds docker will spread the parsed stack description over cluster, create the <code>example_heimdall</code> service on port <em>8080</em>, run service containers on one or more cluster nodes and request the <code>example_configdata</code> volume from rclone plugins on the node hosts. You can use the following commands to confirm results:</p>
<pre><code>docker service ls
docker service ps example_heimdall
docker volume ls</code></pre>
<p>Point your browser to <code>http://cluster.host.address:8080</code> and play with the service. Stop it with <code>docker stack remove example</code> when you are done. Note that the <code>example_configdata</code> volume(s) created on demand at the cluster nodes will not be automatically removed together with the stack but stay for future reuse. You can remove them manually by invoking the <code>docker volume remove example_configdata</code> command on every node.</p>
<h2 id="creating-volumes-via-cli">Creating Volumes via CLI</h2>
<p>Volumes can be created with <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/">docker volume create</a>. Here are a few examples:</p>
<pre><code>docker volume create vol1 -d rclone -o remote=storj: -o vfs-cache-mode=full
docker volume create vol2 -d rclone -o remote=:storj,access_grant=xxx:heimdall
docker volume create vol3 -d rclone -o type=storj -o path=heimdall -o storj-access-grant=xxx -o poll-interval=0</code></pre>
<p>Note the <code>-d rclone</code> flag that tells docker to request volume from the rclone driver. This works even if you installed managed driver by its full name <code>rclone/docker-volume-rclone</code> because you provided the <code>--alias rclone</code> option.</p>
<p>Volumes can be inspected as follows:</p>
<pre><code>docker volume list
docker volume inspect vol1</code></pre>
<h2 id="volume-configuration">Volume Configuration</h2>
<p>Rclone flags and volume options are set via the <code>-o</code> flag to the <code>docker volume create</code> command. They include backend-specific parameters as well as mount and <em>VFS</em> options. Also there are a few special <code>-o</code> options: <code>remote</code>, <code>fs</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>path</code>, <code>mount-type</code> and <code>persist</code>.</p>
<p><code>remote</code> determines an existing remote name from the config file, with trailing colon and optionally with a remote path. See the full syntax in the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#syntax-of-remote-paths">rclone documentation</a>. This option can be aliased as <code>fs</code> to prevent confusion with the <em>remote</em> parameter of such backends as <em>crypt</em> or <em>alias</em>.</p>
<p>The <code>remote=:backend:dir/subdir</code> syntax can be used to create <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#backend-path-to-dir">on-the-fly (config-less) remotes</a>, while the <code>type</code> and <code>path</code> options provide a simpler alternative for this. Using two split options</p>
<pre><code>-o type=backend -o path=dir/subdir</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to the combined syntax</p>
<pre><code>-o remote=:backend:dir/subdir</code></pre>
<p>but is arguably easier to parameterize in scripts. The <code>path</code> part is optional.</p>
<p><a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_docker/#options">Mount and VFS options</a> as well as <a href="https://rclone.org/flags/#backend">backend parameters</a> are named like their twin command-line flags without the <code>--</code> CLI prefix. Optionally you can use underscores instead of dashes in option names. For example, <code>--vfs-cache-mode full</code> becomes <code>-o vfs-cache-mode=full</code> or <code>-o vfs_cache_mode=full</code>. Boolean CLI flags without value will gain the <code>true</code> value, e.g. <code>--allow-other</code> becomes <code>-o allow-other=true</code> or <code>-o allow_other=true</code>.</p>
<p>Please note that you can provide parameters only for the backend immediately referenced by the backend type of mounted <code>remote</code>. If this is a wrapping backend like <em>alias, chunker or crypt</em>, you cannot provide options for the referred to remote or backend. This limitation is imposed by the rclone connection string parser. The only workaround is to feed plugin with <code>rclone.conf</code> or configure plugin arguments (see below).</p>
<h2 id="special-volume-options">Special Volume Options</h2>
<p><code>mount-type</code> determines the mount method and in general can be one of: <code>mount</code>, <code>cmount</code>, or <code>mount2</code>. This can be aliased as <code>mount_type</code>. It should be noted that the managed rclone docker plugin currently does not support the <code>cmount</code> method and <code>mount2</code> is rarely needed. This option defaults to the first found method, which is usually <code>mount</code> so you generally won't need it.</p>
<p><code>persist</code> is a reserved boolean (true/false) option. In future it will allow to persist on-the-fly remotes in the plugin <code>rclone.conf</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="connection-strings-1">Connection Strings</h2>
<p>The <code>remote</code> value can be extended with <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#connection-strings">connection strings</a> as an alternative way to supply backend parameters. This is equivalent to the <code>-o</code> backend options with one <em>syntactic difference</em>. Inside connection string the backend prefix must be dropped from parameter names but in the <code>-o param=value</code> array it must be present. For instance, compare the following option array</p>
<pre><code>-o remote=:sftp:/home -o sftp-host=localhost</code></pre>
<p>with equivalent connection string:</p>
<pre><code>-o remote=:sftp,host=localhost:/home</code></pre>
<p>This difference exists because flag options <code>-o key=val</code> include not only backend parameters but also mount/VFS flags and possibly other settings. Also it allows to discriminate the <code>remote</code> option from the <code>crypt-remote</code> (or similarly named backend parameters) and arguably simplifies scripting due to clearer value substitution.</p>
<h2 id="using-with-swarm-or-compose">Using with Swarm or Compose</h2>
<p>Both <em>Docker Swarm</em> and <em>Docker Compose</em> use <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html">YAML</a>-formatted text files to describe groups (stacks) of containers, their properties, networks and volumes. <em>Compose</em> uses the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#volume-configuration-reference">compose v2</a> format, <em>Swarm</em> uses the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volume-configuration-reference">compose v3</a> format. They are mostly similar, differences are explained in the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#upgrading">docker documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Volumes are described by the children of the top-level <code>volumes:</code> node. Each of them should be named after its volume and have at least two elements, the self-explanatory <code>driver: rclone</code> value and the <code>driver_opts:</code> structure playing the same role as <code>-o key=val</code> CLI flags:</p>
<pre><code>volumes:
  volume_name_1:
    driver: rclone
    driver_opts:
      remote: &#39;gdrive:&#39;
      allow_other: &#39;true&#39;
      vfs_cache_mode: full
      token: &#39;{&quot;type&quot;: &quot;borrower&quot;, &quot;expires&quot;: &quot;2021-12-31&quot;}&#39;
      poll_interval: 0</code></pre>
<p>Notice a few important details: - YAML prefers <code>_</code> in option names instead of <code>-</code>. - YAML treats single and double quotes interchangeably. Simple strings and integers can be left unquoted. - Boolean values must be quoted like <code>'true'</code> or <code>"false"</code> because these two words are reserved by YAML. - The filesystem string is keyed with <code>remote</code> (or with <code>fs</code>). Normally you can omit quotes here, but if the string ends with colon, you <strong>must</strong> quote it like <code>remote: "storage_box:"</code>. - YAML is picky about surrounding braces in values as this is in fact another <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2790832">syntax for key/value mappings</a>. For example, JSON access tokens usually contain double quotes and surrounding braces, so you must put them in single quotes.</p>
<h2 id="installing-as-managed-plugin">Installing as Managed Plugin</h2>
<p>Docker daemon can install plugins from an image registry and run them managed. We maintain the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/p/rclone/docker-volume-rclone/">docker-volume-rclone</a> plugin image on <a href="https://hub.docker.com">Docker Hub</a>.</p>
<p>Rclone volume plugin requires <strong>Docker Engine &gt;= 19.03.15</strong></p>
<p>The plugin requires presence of two directories on the host before it can be installed. Note that plugin will <strong>not</strong> create them automatically. By default they must exist on host at the following locations (though you can tweak the paths): - <code>/var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config</code> is reserved for the <code>rclone.conf</code> config file and <strong>must</strong> exist even if it's empty and the config file is not present. - <code>/var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache</code> holds the plugin state file as well as optional VFS caches.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/plugin_install/">install managed plugin</a> with default settings as follows:</p>
<pre><code>docker plugin install rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64 --grant-all-permissions --alias rclone</code></pre>
<p>The <code>:amd64</code> part of the image specification after colon is called a <em>tag</em>. Usually you will want to install the latest plugin for your architecture. In this case the tag will just name it, like <code>amd64</code> above. The following plugin architectures are currently available: - <code>amd64</code> - <code>arm64</code> - <code>arm-v7</code></p>
<p>Sometimes you might want a concrete plugin version, not the latest one. Then you should use image tag in the form <code>:ARCHITECTURE-VERSION</code>. For example, to install plugin version <code>v1.56.2</code> on architecture <code>arm64</code> you will use tag <code>arm64-1.56.2</code> (note the removed <code>v</code>) so the full image specification becomes <code>rclone/docker-volume-rclone:arm64-1.56.2</code>.</p>
<p>We also provide the <code>latest</code> plugin tag, but since docker does not support multi-architecture plugins as of the time of this writing, this tag is currently an <strong>alias for <code>amd64</code></strong>. By convention the <code>latest</code> tag is the default one and can be omitted, thus both <code>rclone/docker-volume-rclone:latest</code> and just <code>rclone/docker-volume-rclone</code> will refer to the latest plugin release for the <code>amd64</code> platform.</p>
<p>Also the <code>amd64</code> part can be omitted from the versioned rclone plugin tags. For example, rclone image reference <code>rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64-1.56.2</code> can be abbreviated as <code>rclone/docker-volume-rclone:1.56.2</code> for convenience. However, for non-intel architectures you still have to use the full tag as <code>amd64</code> or <code>latest</code> will fail to start.</p>
<p>Managed plugin is in fact a special container running in a namespace separate from normal docker containers. Inside it runs the <code>rclone serve docker</code> command. The config and cache directories are bind-mounted into the container at start. The docker daemon connects to a unix socket created by the command inside the container. The command creates on-demand remote mounts right inside, then docker machinery propagates them through kernel mount namespaces and bind-mounts into requesting user containers.</p>
<p>You can tweak a few plugin settings after installation when it's disabled (not in use), for instance:</p>
<pre><code>docker plugin disable rclone
docker plugin set rclone RCLONE_VERBOSE=2 config=/etc/rclone args=&quot;--vfs-cache-mode=writes --allow-other&quot;
docker plugin enable rclone
docker plugin inspect rclone</code></pre>
<p>Note that if docker refuses to disable the plugin, you should find and remove all active volumes connected with it as well as containers and swarm services that use them. This is rather tedious so please carefully plan in advance.</p>
<p>You can tweak the following settings: <code>args</code>, <code>config</code>, <code>cache</code>, <code>HTTP_PROXY</code>, <code>HTTPS_PROXY</code>, <code>NO_PROXY</code> and <code>RCLONE_VERBOSE</code>. It's <em>your</em> task to keep plugin settings in sync across swarm cluster nodes.</p>
<p><code>args</code> sets command-line arguments for the <code>rclone serve docker</code> command (<em>none</em> by default). Arguments should be separated by space so you will normally want to put them in quotes on the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/plugin_set/">docker plugin set</a> command line. Both <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_docker/#options">serve docker flags</a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/flags/">generic rclone flags</a> are supported, including backend parameters that will be used as defaults for volume creation. Note that plugin will fail (due to <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/v20.10.7/plugin/v2/plugin.go#L195">this docker bug</a>) if the <code>args</code> value is empty. Use e.g. <code>args="-v"</code> as a workaround.</p>
<p><code>config=/host/dir</code> sets alternative host location for the config directory. Plugin will look for <code>rclone.conf</code> here. It's not an error if the config file is not present but the directory must exist. Please note that plugin can periodically rewrite the config file, for example when it renews storage access tokens. Keep this in mind and try to avoid races between the plugin and other instances of rclone on the host that might try to change the config simultaneously resulting in corrupted <code>rclone.conf</code>. You can also put stuff like private key files for SFTP remotes in this directory. Just note that it's bind-mounted inside the plugin container at the predefined path <code>/data/config</code>. For example, if your key file is named <code>sftp-box1.key</code> on the host, the corresponding volume config option should read <code>-o sftp-key-file=/data/config/sftp-box1.key</code>.</p>
<p><code>cache=/host/dir</code> sets alternative host location for the <em>cache</em> directory. The plugin will keep VFS caches here. Also it will create and maintain the <code>docker-plugin.state</code> file in this directory. When the plugin is restarted or reinstalled, it will look in this file to recreate any volumes that existed previously. However, they will not be re-mounted into consuming containers after restart. Usually this is not a problem as the docker daemon normally will restart affected user containers after failures, daemon restarts or host reboots.</p>
<p><code>RCLONE_VERBOSE</code> sets plugin verbosity from <code>0</code> (errors only, by default) to <code>2</code> (debugging). Verbosity can be also tweaked via <code>args="-v [-v] ..."</code>. Since arguments are more generic, you will rarely need this setting. The plugin output by default feeds the docker daemon log on local host. Log entries are reflected as <em>errors</em> in the docker log but retain their actual level assigned by rclone in the encapsulated message string.</p>
<p><code>HTTP_PROXY</code>, <code>HTTPS_PROXY</code>, <code>NO_PROXY</code> customize the plugin proxy settings.</p>
<p>You can set custom plugin options right when you install it, <em>in one go</em>:</p>
<pre><code>docker plugin remove rclone
docker plugin install rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64 \
       --alias rclone --grant-all-permissions \
       args=&quot;-v --allow-other&quot; config=/etc/rclone
docker plugin inspect rclone</code></pre>
<h2 id="healthchecks">Healthchecks</h2>
<p>The docker plugin volume protocol doesn't provide a way for plugins to inform the docker daemon that a volume is (un-)available. As a workaround you can setup a healthcheck to verify that the mount is responding, for example:</p>
<pre><code>services:
  my_service:
    image: my_image
    healthcheck:
      test: ls /path/to/rclone/mount || exit 1
      interval: 1m
      timeout: 15s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 15s</code></pre>
<h2 id="running-plugin-under-systemd">Running Plugin under Systemd</h2>
<p>In most cases you should prefer managed mode. Moreover, MacOS and Windows do not support native Docker plugins. Please use managed mode on these systems. Proceed further only if you are on Linux.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://rclone.org/install/">install rclone</a>. You can just run it (type <code>rclone serve docker</code> and hit enter) for the test.</p>
<p>Install <em>FUSE</em>:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get -y install fuse</code></pre>
<p>Download two systemd configuration files: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rclone/rclone/master/contrib/docker-plugin/systemd/docker-volume-rclone.service">docker-volume-rclone.service</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rclone/rclone/master/contrib/docker-plugin/systemd/docker-volume-rclone.socket">docker-volume-rclone.socket</a>.</p>
<p>Put them to the <code>/etc/systemd/system/</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code>cp docker-volume-plugin.service /etc/systemd/system/
cp docker-volume-plugin.socket  /etc/systemd/system/</code></pre>
<p>Please note that all commands in this section must be run as <em>root</em> but we omit <code>sudo</code> prefix for brevity. Now create directories required by the service:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-volumes/rclone
mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config
mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache</code></pre>
<p>Run the docker plugin service in the socket activated mode:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start docker-volume-rclone.service
systemctl enable docker-volume-rclone.socket
systemctl start docker-volume-rclone.socket
systemctl restart docker</code></pre>
<p>Or run the service directly: - run <code>systemctl daemon-reload</code> to let systemd pick up new config - run <code>systemctl enable docker-volume-rclone.service</code> to make the new service start automatically when you power on your machine. - run <code>systemctl start docker-volume-rclone.service</code> to start the service now. - run <code>systemctl restart docker</code> to restart docker daemon and let it detect the new plugin socket. Note that this step is not needed in managed mode where docker knows about plugin state changes.</p>
<p>The two methods are equivalent from the user perspective, but I personally prefer socket activation.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-1">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>You can <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/#debugging-plugins">see managed plugin settings</a> with</p>
<pre><code>docker plugin list
docker plugin inspect rclone</code></pre>
<p>Note that docker (including latest 20.10.7) will not show actual values of <code>args</code>, just the defaults.</p>
<p>Use <code>journalctl --unit docker</code> to see managed plugin output as part of the docker daemon log. Note that docker reflects plugin lines as <em>errors</em> but their actual level can be seen from encapsulated message string.</p>
<p>You will usually install the latest version of managed plugin for your platform. Use the following commands to print the actual installed version:</p>
<pre><code>PLUGID=$(docker plugin list --no-trunc | awk &#39;/rclone/{print$1}&#39;)
sudo runc --root /run/docker/runtime-runc/plugins.moby exec $PLUGID rclone version</code></pre>
<p>You can even use <code>runc</code> to run shell inside the plugin container:</p>
<pre><code>sudo runc --root /run/docker/runtime-runc/plugins.moby exec --tty $PLUGID bash</code></pre>
<p>Also you can use curl to check the plugin socket connectivity:</p>
<pre><code>docker plugin list --no-trunc
PLUGID=123abc...
sudo curl -H Content-Type:application/json -XPOST -d {} --unix-socket /run/docker/plugins/$PLUGID/rclone.sock http://localhost/Plugin.Activate</code></pre>
<p>though this is rarely needed.</p>
<p>If the plugin fails to work properly, and only as a last resort after you tried diagnosing with the above methods, you can try clearing the state of the plugin. <strong>Note that all existing rclone docker volumes will probably have to be recreated.</strong> This might be needed because a reinstall don't cleanup existing state files to allow for easy restoration, as stated above.</p>
<pre><code>docker plugin disable rclone # disable the plugin to ensure no interference
sudo rm /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache/docker-plugin.state # removing the plugin state
docker plugin enable rclone # re-enable the plugin afterward</code></pre>
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<p>Finally I'd like to mention a <em>caveat with updating volume settings</em>. Docker CLI does not have a dedicated command like <code>docker volume update</code>. It may be tempting to invoke <code>docker volume create</code> with updated options on existing volume, but there is a gotcha. The command will do nothing, it won't even return an error. I hope that docker maintainers will fix this some day. In the meantime be aware that you must remove your volume before recreating it with new settings:</p>
<pre><code>docker volume remove my_vol
docker volume create my_vol -d rclone -o opt1=new_val1 ...</code></pre>
<p>and verify that settings did update:</p>
<pre><code>docker volume list
docker volume inspect my_vol</code></pre>
<p>If docker refuses to remove the volume, you should find containers or swarm services that use it and stop them first.</p>
<h2 id="bisync">Bisync</h2>
<p><code>bisync</code> is <strong>in beta</strong> and is considered an <strong>advanced command</strong>, so use with care. Make sure you have read and understood the entire <a href="https://rclone.org/bisync">manual</a> (especially the <a href="#limitations">Limitations</a> section) before using, or data loss can result. Questions can be asked in the <a href="https://forum.rclone.org/">Rclone Forum</a>.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rclone.org/install/">Install rclone</a> and setup your remotes.</li>
<li>Bisync will create its working directory at <code>~/.cache/rclone/bisync</code> on Linux, <code>/Users/yourusername/Library/Caches/rclone/bisync</code> on Mac, or <code>C:\Users\MyLogin\AppData\Local\rclone\bisync</code> on Windows. Make sure that this location is writable.</li>
<li>Run bisync with the <code>--resync</code> flag, specifying the paths to the local and remote sync directory roots.</li>
<li>For successive sync runs, leave off the <code>--resync</code> flag. (<strong>Important!</strong>)</li>
<li>Consider using a <a href="#filtering">filters file</a> for excluding unnecessary files and directories from the sync.</li>
<li>Consider setting up the <a href="#check-access">--check-access</a> feature for safety.</li>
<li>On Linux or Mac, consider setting up a <a href="#cron">crontab entry</a>. bisync can safely run in concurrent cron jobs thanks to lock files it maintains.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, your first command might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>rclone bisync remote1:path1 remote2:path2 --create-empty-src-dirs --compare size,modtime,checksum --slow-hash-sync-only --resilient -MvP --drive-skip-gdocs --fix-case --resync --dry-run</code></pre>
<p>If all looks good, run it again without <code>--dry-run</code>. After that, remove <code>--resync</code> as well.</p>
<p>Here is a typical run log (with timestamps removed for clarity):</p>

      --resync-mode string                   During resync, prefer the version that is: path1, path2, newer, older, larger, smaller (default: path1 if --resync, otherwise none for no resync.) (default &quot;none&quot;)
      --retries int                          Retry operations this many times if they fail (requires --resilient). (default 3)
      --retries-sleep Duration               Interval between retrying operations if they fail, e.g. 500ms, 60s, 5m (0 to disable) (default 0s)
      --slow-hash-sync-only                  Ignore slow checksums for listings and deltas, but still consider them during sync calls.
      --workdir string                       Use custom working dir - useful for testing. (default: {WORKDIR})
      --max-delete PERCENT                   Safety check on maximum percentage of deleted files allowed. If exceeded, the bisync run will abort. (default: 50%)
  -n, --dry-run                              Go through the motions - No files are copied/deleted.
  -v, --verbose                              Increases logging verbosity. May be specified more than once for more details.</code></pre>
<p>Arbitrary rclone flags may be specified on the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_bisync/">bisync command line</a>, for example <code>rclone bisync ./testdir/path1/ gdrive:testdir/path2/ --drive-skip-gdocs -v -v --timeout 10s</code> Note that interactions of various rclone flags with bisync process flow has not been fully tested yet.</p>
<h3 id="paths">Paths</h3>
<p>Path1 and Path2 arguments may be references to any mix of local directory paths (absolute or relative), UNC paths (<code>//server/share/path</code>), Windows drive paths (with a drive letter and <code>:</code>) or configured <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#syntax-of-remote-paths">remotes</a> with optional subdirectory paths. Cloud references are distinguished by having a <code>:</code> in the argument (see <a href="#windows">Windows support</a> below).</p>
<p>Path1 and Path2 are treated equally, in that neither has priority for file changes (except during <a href="#resync"><code>--resync</code></a>), and access efficiency does not change whether a remote is on Path1 or Path2.</p>
<p>The listings in bisync working directory (default: <code>~/.cache/rclone/bisync</code>) are named based on the Path1 and Path2 arguments so that separate syncs to individual directories within the tree may be set up, e.g.: <code>path_to_local_tree..dropbox_subdir.lst</code>.</p>
<p>Any empty directories after the sync on both the Path1 and Path2 filesystems are not deleted by default, unless <code>--create-empty-src-dirs</code> is specified. If the <code>--remove-empty-dirs</code> flag is specified, then both paths will have ALL empty directories purged as the last step in the process.</p>
<h2 id="command-line-flags">Command-line flags</h2>
<h3 id="resync">--resync</h3>
<p>This will effectively make both Path1 and Path2 filesystems contain a matching superset of all files. By default, Path2 files that do not exist in Path1 will be copied to Path1, and the process will then copy the Path1 tree to Path2.</p>
<p>The <code>--resync</code> sequence is roughly equivalent to the following (but see <a href="#resync-mode"><code>--resync-mode</code></a> for other options):</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy Path2 Path1 --ignore-existing [--create-empty-src-dirs]
rclone copy Path1 Path2 [--create-empty-src-dirs]</code></pre>
<p>The base directories on both Path1 and Path2 filesystems must exist or bisync will fail. This is required for safety - that bisync can verify that both paths are valid.</p>
<p>When using <code>--resync</code>, a newer version of a file on the Path2 filesystem will (by default) be overwritten by the Path1 filesystem version. (Note that this is <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5681#issuecomment-938761815">NOT entirely symmetrical</a>, and more symmetrical options can be specified with the <a href="#resync-mode"><code>--resync-mode</code></a> flag.) Carefully evaluate deltas using <a href="https://rclone.org/flags/#non-backend-flags">--dry-run</a>.</p>
<p>For a resync run, one of the paths may be empty (no files in the path tree). The resync run should result in files on both paths, else a normal non-resync run will fail.</p>
<p>For a non-resync run, either path being empty (no files in the tree) fails with <code>Empty current PathN listing. Cannot sync to an empty directory: X.pathN.lst</code> This is a safety check that an unexpected empty path does not result in deleting <strong>everything</strong> in the other path.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--resync</code> implies <code>--resync-mode path1</code> unless a different <a href="#resync-mode"><code>--resync-mode</code></a> is explicitly specified. It is not necessary to use both the <code>--resync</code> and <code>--resync-mode</code> flags -- either one is sufficient without the other.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>--resync</code> (including <code>--resync-mode</code>) should only be used under three specific (rare) circumstances: 1. It is your <em>first</em> bisync run (between these two paths) 2. You've just made changes to your bisync settings (such as editing the contents of your <code>--filters-file</code>) 3. There was an error on the prior run, and as a result, bisync now requires <code>--resync</code> to recover</p>
<p>The rest of the time, you should <em>omit</em> <code>--resync</code>. The reason is because <code>--resync</code> will only <em>copy</em> (not <em>sync</em>) each side to the other. Therefore, if you included <code>--resync</code> for every bisync run, it would never be possible to delete a file -- the deleted file would always keep reappearing at the end of every run (because it's being copied from the other side where it still exists). Similarly, renaming a file would always result in a duplicate copy (both old and new name) on both sides.</p>
<p>If you find that frequent interruptions from #3 are an issue, rather than automatically running <code>--resync</code>, the recommended alternative is to use the <a href="#resilient"><code>--resilient</code></a>, <a href="#recover"><code>--recover</code></a>, and <a href="#conflict-resolve"><code>--conflict-resolve</code></a> flags, (along with <a href="#graceful-shutdown">Graceful Shutdown</a> mode, when needed) for a very robust "set-it-and-forget-it" bisync setup that can automatically bounce back from almost any interruption it might encounter. Consider adding something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>--resilient --recover --max-lock 2m --conflict-resolve newer</code></pre>
<h3 id="resync-mode">--resync-mode CHOICE</h3>
<p>In the event that a file differs on both sides during a <code>--resync</code>, <code>--resync-mode</code> controls which version will overwrite the other. The supported options are similar to <a href="#conflict-resolve"><code>--conflict-resolve</code></a>. For all of the following options, the version that is kept is referred to as the "winner", and the version that is overwritten (deleted) is referred to as the "loser". The options are named after the "winner":</p>
<ul>
<li><code>path1</code> - (the default) - the version from Path1 is unconditionally considered the winner (regardless of <code>modtime</code> and <code>size</code>, if any). This can be useful if one side is more trusted or up-to-date than the other, at the time of the <code>--resync</code>.</li>
<li><code>path2</code> - same as <code>path1</code>, except the path2 version is considered the winner.</li>
<li><code>newer</code> - the newer file (by <code>modtime</code>) is considered the winner, regardless of which side it came from. This may result in having a mix of some winners from Path1, and some winners from Path2. (The implementation is analogous to running <code>rclone copy --update</code> in both directions.)</li>
<li><code>older</code> - same as <code>newer</code>, except the older file is considered the winner, and the newer file is considered the loser.</li>
<li><code>larger</code> - the larger file (by <code>size</code>) is considered the winner (regardless of <code>modtime</code>, if any). This can be a useful option for remotes without <code>modtime</code> support, or with the kinds of files (such as logs) that tend to grow but not shrink, over time.</li>
<li><code>smaller</code> - the smaller file (by <code>size</code>) is considered the winner (regardless of <code>modtime</code>, if any).</li>
</ul>
<p>For all of the above options, note the following: - If either of the underlying remotes lacks support for the chosen method, it will be ignored and will fall back to the default of <code>path1</code>. (For example, if <code>--resync-mode newer</code> is set, but one of the paths uses a remote that doesn't support <code>modtime</code>.) - If a winner can't be determined because the chosen method's attribute is missing or equal, it will be ignored, and bisync will instead try to determine whether the files differ by looking at the other <code>--compare</code> methods in effect. (For example, if <code>--resync-mode newer</code> is set, but the Path1 and Path2 modtimes are identical, bisync will compare the sizes.) If bisync concludes that they differ, preference is given to whichever is the "source" at that moment. (In practice, this gives a slight advantage to Path2, as the 2to1 copy comes before the 1to2 copy.) If the files <em>do not</em> differ, nothing is copied (as both sides are already correct). - These options apply only to files that exist on both sides (with the same name and relative path). Files that exist <em>only</em> on one side and not the other are <em>always</em> copied to the other, during <code>--resync</code> (this is one of the main differences between resync and non-resync runs.). - <code>--conflict-resolve</code>, <code>--conflict-loser</code>, and <code>--conflict-suffix</code> do not apply during <code>--resync</code>, and unlike these flags, nothing is renamed during <code>--resync</code>. When a file differs on both sides during <code>--resync</code>, one version always overwrites the other (much like in <code>rclone copy</code>.) (Consider using <a href="#backup-dir1-and-backup-dir2"><code>--backup-dir</code></a> to retain a backup of the losing version.) - Unlike for <code>--conflict-resolve</code>, <code>--resync-mode none</code> is not a valid option (or rather, it will be interpreted as "no resync", unless <code>--resync</code> has also been specified, in which case it will be ignored.) - Winners and losers are decided at the individual file-level only (there is not currently an option to pick an entire winning directory atomically, although the <code>path1</code> and <code>path2</code> options typically produce a similar result.) - To maintain backward-compatibility, the <code>--resync</code> flag implies <code>--resync-mode path1</code> unless a different <code>--resync-mode</code> is explicitly specified. Similarly, all <code>--resync-mode</code> options (except <code>none</code>) imply <code>--resync</code>, so it is not necessary to use both the <code>--resync</code> and <code>--resync-mode</code> flags simultaneously -- either one is sufficient without the other.</p>
<h3 id="check-access">--check-access</h3>
<p>Access check files are an additional safety measure against data loss. bisync will ensure it can find matching <code>RCLONE_TEST</code> files in the same places in the Path1 and Path2 filesystems. <code>RCLONE_TEST</code> files are not generated automatically. For <code>--check-access</code> to succeed, you must first either: <strong>A)</strong> Place one or more <code>RCLONE_TEST</code> files in both systems, or <strong>B)</strong> Set <code>--check-filename</code> to a filename already in use in various locations throughout your sync'd fileset. Recommended methods for <strong>A)</strong> include: * <code>rclone touch Path1/RCLONE_TEST</code> (create a new file) * <code>rclone copyto Path1/RCLONE_TEST Path2/RCLONE_TEST</code> (copy an existing file) * <code>rclone copy Path1/RCLONE_TEST Path2/RCLONE_TEST  --include "RCLONE_TEST"</code> (copy multiple files at once, recursively) * create the files manually (outside of rclone) * run <code>bisync</code> once <em>without</em> <code>--check-access</code> to set matching files on both filesystems will also work, but is not preferred, due to potential for user error (you are temporarily disabling the safety feature).</p>
<p>Note that <code>--check-access</code> is still enforced on <code>--resync</code>, so <code>bisync --resync --check-access</code> will not work as a method of initially setting the files (this is to ensure that bisync can't <a href="https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=3.%20%2D%2Dcheck%2Daccess%20doesn%27t%20always%20fail%20when%20it%20should">inadvertently circumvent its own safety switch</a>.)</p>
<p>Time stamps and file contents for <code>RCLONE_TEST</code> files are not important, just the names and locations. If you have symbolic links in your sync tree it is recommended to place <code>RCLONE_TEST</code> files in the linked-to directory tree to protect against bisync assuming a bunch of deleted files if the linked-to tree should not be accessible. See also the <a href="--check-filename">--check-filename</a> flag.</p>
<h3 id="check-filename">--check-filename</h3>
<p>Name of the file(s) used in access health validation. The default <code>--check-filename</code> is <code>RCLONE_TEST</code>. One or more files having this filename must exist, synchronized between your source and destination filesets, in order for <code>--check-access</code> to succeed. See <a href="#check-access">--check-access</a> for additional details.</p>
<h3 id="compare">--compare</h3>
<p>As of <code>v1.66</code>, bisync fully supports comparing based on any combination of size, modtime, and checksum (lifting the prior restriction on backends without modtime support.)</p>
<p>By default (without the <code>--compare</code> flag), bisync inherits the same comparison options as <code>sync</code> (that is: <code>size</code> and <code>modtime</code> by default, unless modified with flags such as <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#c-checksum"><code>--checksum</code></a> or <a href="/docs/#size-only"><code>--size-only</code></a>.)</p>
<p>If the <code>--compare</code> flag is set, it will override these defaults. This can be useful if you wish to compare based on combinations not currently supported in <code>sync</code>, such as comparing all three of <code>size</code> AND <code>modtime</code> AND <code>checksum</code> simultaneously (or just <code>modtime</code> AND <code>checksum</code>).</p>
<p><code>--compare</code> takes a comma-separated list, with the currently supported values being <code>size</code>, <code>modtime</code>, and <code>checksum</code>. For example, if you want to compare size and checksum, but not modtime, you would do:</p>
<pre><code>--compare size,checksum</code></pre>
<p>Or if you want to compare all three:</p>
<pre><code>--compare size,modtime,checksum</code></pre>
<p><code>--compare</code> overrides any conflicting flags. For example, if you set the conflicting flags <code>--compare checksum --size-only</code>, <code>--size-only</code> will be ignored, and bisync will compare checksum and not size. To avoid confusion, it is recommended to use <em>either</em> <code>--compare</code> or the normal <code>sync</code> flags, but not both.</p>
<p>If <code>--compare</code> includes <code>checksum</code> and both remotes support checksums but have no hash types in common with each other, checksums will be considered <em>only</em> for comparisons within the same side (to determine what has changed since the prior sync), but not for comparisons against the opposite side. If one side supports checksums and the other does not, checksums will only be considered on the side that supports them.</p>
<p>When comparing with <code>checksum</code> and/or <code>size</code> without <code>modtime</code>, bisync cannot determine whether a file is <code>newer</code> or <code>older</code> -- only whether it is <code>changed</code> or <code>unchanged</code>. (If it is <code>changed</code> on both sides, bisync still does the standard equality-check to avoid declaring a sync conflict unless it absolutely has to.)</p>
<p>It is recommended to do a <code>--resync</code> when changing <code>--compare</code> settings, as otherwise your prior listing files may not contain the attributes you wish to compare (for example, they will not have stored checksums if you were not previously comparing checksums.)</p>
<h3 id="ignore-listing-checksum">--ignore-listing-checksum</h3>
<p>When <code>--checksum</code> or <code>--compare checksum</code> is set, bisync will retrieve (or generate) checksums (for backends that support them) when creating the listings for both paths, and store the checksums in the listing files. <code>--ignore-listing-checksum</code> will disable this behavior, which may speed things up considerably, especially on backends (such as <a href="https://rclone.org/local/">local</a>) where hashes must be computed on the fly instead of retrieved. Please note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>As of <code>v1.66</code>, <code>--ignore-listing-checksum</code> is now automatically set when neither <code>--checksum</code> nor <code>--compare checksum</code> are in use (as the checksums would not be used for anything.)</li>
<li><code>--ignore-listing-checksum</code> is NOT the same as <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#ignore-checksum"><code>--ignore-checksum</code></a>, and you may wish to use one or the other, or both. In a nutshell: <code>--ignore-listing-checksum</code> controls whether checksums are considered when scanning for diffs, while <code>--ignore-checksum</code> controls whether checksums are considered during the copy/sync operations that follow, if there ARE diffs.</li>
<li>Unless <code>--ignore-listing-checksum</code> is passed, bisync currently computes hashes for one path <em>even when there's no common hash with the other path</em> (for example, a <a href="https://rclone.org/crypt/#modification-times-and-hashes">crypt</a> remote.) This can still be beneficial, as the hashes will still be used to detect changes within the same side (if <code>--checksum</code> or <code>--compare checksum</code> is set), even if they can't be used to compare against the opposite side.</li>
<li>If you wish to ignore listing checksums <em>only</em> on remotes where they are slow to compute, consider using <a href="#no-slow-hash"><code>--no-slow-hash</code></a> (or <a href="#slow-hash-sync-only"><code>--slow-hash-sync-only</code></a>) instead of <code>--ignore-listing-checksum</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>--ignore-listing-checksum</code> is used simultaneously with <code>--compare checksum</code> (or <code>--checksum</code>), checksums will be ignored for bisync deltas, but still considered during the sync operations that follow (if deltas are detected based on modtime and/or size.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="no-slow-hash">--no-slow-hash</h3>
<p>On some remotes (notably <code>local</code>), checksums can dramatically slow down a bisync run, because hashes cannot be stored and need to be computed in real-time when they are requested. On other remotes (such as <code>drive</code>), they add practically no time at all. The <code>--no-slow-hash</code> flag will automatically skip checksums on remotes where they are slow, while still comparing them on others (assuming <a href="#compare"><code>--compare</code></a> includes <code>checksum</code>.) This can be useful when one of your bisync paths is slow but you still want to check checksums on the other, for a more robust sync.</p>
<h3 id="slow-hash-sync-only">--slow-hash-sync-only</h3>
<p>Same as <a href="#no-slow-hash"><code>--no-slow-hash</code></a>, except slow hashes are still considered during sync calls. They are still NOT considered for determining deltas, nor or they included in listings. They are also skipped during <code>--resync</code>. The main use case for this flag is when you have a large number of files, but relatively few of them change from run to run -- so you don't want to check your entire tree every time (it would take too long), but you still want to consider checksums for the smaller group of files for which a <code>modtime</code> or <code>size</code> change was detected. Keep in mind that this speed savings comes with a safety trade-off: if a file's content were to change without a change to its <code>modtime</code> or <code>size</code>, bisync would not detect it, and it would not be synced.</p>
<p><code>--slow-hash-sync-only</code> is only useful if both remotes share a common hash type (if they don't, bisync will automatically fall back to <code>--no-slow-hash</code>.) Both <code>--no-slow-hash</code> and <code>--slow-hash-sync-only</code> have no effect without <code>--compare checksum</code> (or <code>--checksum</code>).</p>
<h3 id="download-hash">--download-hash</h3>
<p>If <code>--download-hash</code> is set, bisync will use best efforts to obtain an MD5 checksum by downloading and computing on-the-fly, when checksums are not otherwise available (for example, a remote that doesn't support them.) Note that since rclone has to download the entire file, this may dramatically slow down your bisync runs, and is also likely to use a lot of data, so it is probably not practical for bisync paths with a large total file size. However, it can be a good option for syncing small-but-important files with maximum accuracy (for example, a source code repo on a <code>crypt</code> remote.) An additional advantage over methods like <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_cryptcheck/"><code>cryptcheck</code></a> is that the original file is not required for comparison (for example, <code>--download-hash</code> can be used to bisync two different crypt remotes with different passwords.)</p>
<p>When <code>--download-hash</code> is set, bisync still looks for more efficient checksums first, and falls back to downloading only when none are found. It takes priority over conflicting flags such as <code>--no-slow-hash</code>. <code>--download-hash</code> is not suitable for <a href="#gdocs">Google Docs</a> and other files of unknown size, as their checksums would change from run to run (due to small variances in the internals of the generated export file.) Therefore, bisync automatically skips <code>--download-hash</code> for files with a size less than 0.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://rclone.org/hasher/"><code>Hasher</code></a> backend, <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_cryptcheck/"><code>cryptcheck</code></a> command, <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/"><code>rclone check --download</code></a> option, <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_md5sum/"><code>md5sum</code></a> command</p>
<h3 id="max-delete">--max-delete</h3>
<p>As a safety check, if greater than the <code>--max-delete</code> percent of files were deleted on either the Path1 or Path2 filesystem, then bisync will abort with a warning message, without making any changes. The default <code>--max-delete</code> is <code>50%</code>. One way to trigger this limit is to rename a directory that contains more than half of your files. This will appear to bisync as a bunch of deleted files and a bunch of new files. This safety check is intended to block bisync from deleting all of the files on both filesystems due to a temporary network access issue, or if the user had inadvertently deleted the files on one side or the other. To force the sync, either set a different delete percentage limit, e.g. <code>--max-delete 75</code> (allows up to 75% deletion), or use <code>--force</code> to bypass the check.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="#all-files-changed">all files changed</a> check.</p>
<h3 id="filters-file">--filters-file</h3>
<p>By using rclone filter features you can exclude file types or directory sub-trees from the sync. See the <a href="#filtering">bisync filters</a> section and generic <a href="https://rclone.org/filtering/#filter-from-read-filtering-patterns-from-a-file">--filter-from</a> documentation. An <a href="#example-filters-file">example filters file</a> contains filters for non-allowed files for syncing with Dropbox.</p>
<p>If you make changes to your filters file then bisync requires a run with <code>--resync</code>. This is a safety feature, which prevents existing files on the Path1 and/or Path2 side from seeming to disappear from view (since they are excluded in the new listings), which would fool bisync into seeing them as deleted (as compared to the prior run listings), and then bisync would proceed to delete them for real.</p>
<p>To block this from happening, bisync calculates an MD5 hash of the filters file and stores the hash in a <code>.md5</code> file in the same place as your filters file. On the next run with <code>--filters-file</code> set, bisync re-calculates the MD5 hash of the current filters file and compares it to the hash stored in the <code>.md5</code> file. If they don't match, the run aborts with a critical error and thus forces you to do a <code>--resync</code>, likely avoiding a disaster.</p>
<h3 id="conflict-resolve">--conflict-resolve CHOICE</h3>
<p>In bisync, a "conflict" is a file that is <em>new</em> or <em>changed</em> on <em>both sides</em> (relative to the prior run) AND is <em>not currently identical</em> on both sides. <code>--conflict-resolve</code> controls how bisync handles such a scenario. The currently supported options are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>none</code> - (the default) - do not attempt to pick a winner, keep and rename both files according to <a href="#conflict-loser"><code>--conflict-loser</code></a> and <a href="#conflict-suffix"><code>--conflict-suffix</code></a> settings. For example, with the default settings, <code>file.txt</code> on Path1 is renamed <code>file.txt.conflict1</code> and <code>file.txt</code> on Path2 is renamed <code>file.txt.conflict2</code>. Both are copied to the opposite path during the run, so both sides end up with a copy of both files. (As <code>none</code> is the default, it is not necessary to specify <code>--conflict-resolve none</code> -- you can just omit the flag.)</li>
<li><code>newer</code> - the newer file (by <code>modtime</code>) is considered the winner and is copied without renaming. The older file (the "loser") is handled according to <code>--conflict-loser</code> and <code>--conflict-suffix</code> settings (either renamed or deleted.) For example, if <code>file.txt</code> on Path1 is newer than <code>file.txt</code> on Path2, the result on both sides (with other default settings) will be <code>file.txt</code> (winner from Path1) and <code>file.txt.conflict1</code> (loser from Path2).</li>
<li><code>older</code> - same as <code>newer</code>, except the older file is considered the winner, and the newer file is considered the loser.</li>
<li><code>larger</code> - the larger file (by <code>size</code>) is considered the winner (regardless of <code>modtime</code>, if any).</li>
<li><code>smaller</code> - the smaller file (by <code>size</code>) is considered the winner (regardless of <code>modtime</code>, if any).</li>
<li><code>path1</code> - the version from Path1 is unconditionally considered the winner (regardless of <code>modtime</code> and <code>size</code>, if any). This can be useful if one side is usually more trusted or up-to-date than the other.</li>
<li><code>path2</code> - same as <code>path1</code>, except the path2 version is considered the winner.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all of the above options, note the following: - If either of the underlying remotes lacks support for the chosen method, it will be ignored and fall back to <code>none</code>. (For example, if <code>--conflict-resolve newer</code> is set, but one of the paths uses a remote that doesn't support <code>modtime</code>.) - If a winner can't be determined because the chosen method's attribute is missing or equal, it will be ignored and fall back to <code>none</code>. (For example, if <code>--conflict-resolve newer</code> is set, but the Path1 and Path2 modtimes are identical, even if the sizes may differ.) - If the file's content is currently identical on both sides, it is not considered a "conflict", even if new or changed on both sides since the prior sync. (For example, if you made a change on one side and then synced it to the other side by other means.) Therefore, none of the conflict resolution flags apply in this scenario. - The conflict resolution flags do not apply during a <code>--resync</code>, as there is no "prior run" to speak of (but see <a href="#resync-mode"><code>--resync-mode</code></a> for similar options.)</p>
<h3 id="conflict-loser">--conflict-loser CHOICE</h3>
<p><code>--conflict-loser</code> determines what happens to the "loser" of a sync conflict (when <a href="#conflict-resolve"><code>--conflict-resolve</code></a> determines a winner) or to both files (when there is no winner.) The currently supported options are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>num</code> - (the default) - auto-number the conflicts by automatically appending the next available number to the <code>--conflict-suffix</code>, in chronological order. For example, with the default settings, the first conflict for <code>file.txt</code> will be renamed <code>file.txt.conflict1</code>. If <code>file.txt.conflict1</code> already exists, <code>file.txt.conflict2</code> will be used instead (etc., up to a maximum of 9223372036854775807 conflicts.)</li>
<li><code>pathname</code> - rename the conflicts according to which side they came from, which was the default behavior prior to <code>v1.66</code>. For example, with <code>--conflict-suffix path</code>, <code>file.txt</code> from Path1 will be renamed <code>file.txt.path1</code>, and <code>file.txt</code> from Path2 will be renamed <code>file.txt.path2</code>. If two non-identical suffixes are provided (ex. <code>--conflict-suffix cloud,local</code>), the trailing digit is omitted. Importantly, note that with <code>pathname</code>, there is no auto-numbering beyond <code>2</code>, so if <code>file.txt.path2</code> somehow already exists, it will be overwritten. Using a dynamic date variable in your <code>--conflict-suffix</code> (see below) is one possible way to avoid this. Note also that conflicts-of-conflicts are possible, if the original conflict is not manually resolved -- for example, if for some reason you edited <code>file.txt.path1</code> on both sides, and those edits were different, the result would be <code>file.txt.path1.path1</code> and <code>file.txt.path1.path2</code> (in addition to <code>file.txt.path2</code>.)</li>
<li><code>delete</code> - keep the winner only and delete the loser, instead of renaming it. If a winner cannot be determined (see <code>--conflict-resolve</code> for details on how this could happen), <code>delete</code> is ignored and the default <code>num</code> is used instead (i.e. both versions are kept and renamed, and neither is deleted.) <code>delete</code> is inherently the most destructive option, so use it only with care.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all of the above options, note that if a winner cannot be determined (see <code>--conflict-resolve</code> for details on how this could happen), or if <code>--conflict-resolve</code> is not in use, <em>both</em> files will be renamed.</p>
<h3 id="conflict-suffix">--conflict-suffix STRING[,STRING]</h3>
<p><code>--conflict-suffix</code> controls the suffix that is appended when bisync renames a <a href="#conflict-loser"><code>--conflict-loser</code></a> (default: <code>conflict</code>). <code>--conflict-suffix</code> will accept either one string or two comma-separated strings to assign different suffixes to Path1 vs. Path2. This may be helpful later in identifying the source of the conflict. (For example, <code>--conflict-suffix dropboxconflict,laptopconflict</code>)</p>
<p>With <code>--conflict-loser num</code>, a number is always appended to the suffix. With <code>--conflict-loser pathname</code>, a number is appended only when one suffix is specified (or when two identical suffixes are specified.) i.e. with <code>--conflict-loser pathname</code>, all of the following would produce exactly the same result:</p>
<pre><code>--conflict-suffix path
--conflict-suffix path,path
--conflict-suffix path1,path2</code></pre>
<p>Suffixes may be as short as 1 character. By default, the suffix is appended after any other extensions (ex. <code>file.jpg.conflict1</code>), however, this can be changed with the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#suffix-keep-extension"><code>--suffix-keep-extension</code></a> flag (i.e. to instead result in <code>file.conflict1.jpg</code>).</p>
<p><code>--conflict-suffix</code> supports several <em>dynamic date variables</em> when enclosed in curly braces as globs. This can be helpful to track the date and/or time that each conflict was handled by bisync. For example:</p>
<pre><code>--conflict-suffix {DateOnly}-conflict
// result: myfile.txt.2006-01-02-conflict1</code></pre>
<p>All of the formats described <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants">here</a> and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/time#example-Time.Format">here</a> are supported, but take care to ensure that your chosen format does not use any characters that are illegal on your remotes (for example, macOS does not allow colons in filenames, and slashes are also best avoided as they are often interpreted as directory separators.) To address this particular issue, an additional <code>{MacFriendlyTime}</code> (or just <code>{mac}</code>) option is supported, which results in <code>2006-01-02 0304PM</code>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--conflict-suffix</code> is entirely separate from rclone's main <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#suffix-suffix"><code>--sufix</code></a> flag. This is intentional, as users may wish to use both flags simultaneously, if also using <a href="#backup-dir1-and-backup-dir2"><code>--backup-dir</code></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, note that the default in bisync prior to <code>v1.66</code> was to rename conflicts with <code>..path1</code> and <code>..path2</code> (with two periods, and <code>path</code> instead of <code>conflict</code>.) Bisync now defaults to a single dot instead of a double dot, but additional dots can be added by including them in the specified suffix string. For example, for behavior equivalent to the previous default, use:</p>
<pre><code>[--conflict-resolve none] --conflict-loser pathname --conflict-suffix .path</code></pre>
<h3 id="check-sync">--check-sync</h3>
<p>Enabled by default, the check-sync function checks that all of the same files exist in both the Path1 and Path2 history listings. This <em>check-sync</em> integrity check is performed at the end of the sync run by default. Any untrapped failing copy/deletes between the two paths might result in differences between the two listings and in the untracked file content differences between the two paths. A resync run would correct the error.</p>
<p>Note that the default-enabled integrity check locally executes a load of both the final Path1 and Path2 listings, and thus adds to the run time of a sync. Using <code>--check-sync=false</code> will disable it and may significantly reduce the sync run times for very large numbers of files.</p>
<p>The check may be run manually with <code>--check-sync=only</code>. It runs only the integrity check and terminates without actually syncing.</p>
<p>Note that currently, <code>--check-sync</code> <strong>only checks listing snapshots and NOT the actual files on the remotes.</strong> Note also that the listing snapshots will not know about any changes that happened during or after the latest bisync run, as those will be discovered on the next run. Therefore, while listings should always match <em>each other</em> at the end of a bisync run, it is <em>expected</em> that they will not match the underlying remotes, nor will the remotes match each other, if there were changes during or after the run. This is normal, and any differences will be detected and synced on the next run.</p>
<p>For a robust integrity check of the current state of the remotes (as opposed to just their listing snapshots), consider using <a href="commands/rclone_check/"><code>check</code></a> (or <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_cryptcheck/"><code>cryptcheck</code></a>, if at least one path is a <code>crypt</code> remote) instead of <code>--check-sync</code>, keeping in mind that differences are expected if files changed during or after your last bisync run.</p>
<p>For example, a possible sequence could look like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Normally scheduled bisync run:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>rclone bisync Path1 Path2 -MPc --check-access --max-delete 10 --filters-file /path/to/filters.txt -v --no-cleanup --ignore-listing-checksum --disable ListR --checkers=16 --drive-pacer-min-sleep=10ms --create-empty-src-dirs --resilient</code></pre>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Periodic independent integrity check (perhaps scheduled nightly or weekly):</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>rclone check -MvPc Path1 Path2 --filter-from /path/to/filters.txt</code></pre>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>If diffs are found, you have some choices to correct them. If one side is more up-to-date and you want to make the other side match it, you could run:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>rclone sync Path1 Path2 --filter-from /path/to/filters.txt --create-empty-src-dirs -MPc -v</code></pre>
<p>(or switch Path1 and Path2 to make Path2 the source-of-truth)</p>
<p>Or, if neither side is totally up-to-date, you could run a <code>--resync</code> to bring them back into agreement (but remember that this could cause deleted files to re-appear.)</p>
<p>*Note also that <code>rclone check</code> does not currently include empty directories, so if you want to know if any empty directories are out of sync, consider alternatively running the above <code>rclone sync</code> command with <code>--dry-run</code> added.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="#concurrent-modifications">Concurrent modifications</a>, <a href="#resilient"><code>--resilient</code></a></p>
<h3 id="resilient">--resilient</h3>
<p><strong><em>Caution: this is an experimental feature. Use at your own risk!</em></strong></p>
<p>By default, most errors or interruptions will cause bisync to abort and require <a href="#resync"><code>--resync</code></a> to recover. This is a safety feature, to prevent bisync from running again until a user checks things out. However, in some cases, bisync can go too far and enforce a lockout when one isn't actually necessary, like for certain less-serious errors that might resolve themselves on the next run. When <code>--resilient</code> is specified, bisync tries its best to recover and self-correct, and only requires <code>--resync</code> as a last resort when a human's involvement is absolutely necessary. The intended use case is for running bisync as a background process (such as via scheduled <a href="#cron">cron</a>).</p>
<p>When using <code>--resilient</code> mode, bisync will still report the error and abort, however it will not lock out future runs -- allowing the possibility of retrying at the next normally scheduled time, without requiring a <code>--resync</code> first. Examples of such retryable errors include access test failures, missing listing files, and filter change detections. These safety features will still prevent the <em>current</em> run from proceeding -- the difference is that if conditions have improved by the time of the <em>next</em> run, that next run will be allowed to proceed. Certain more serious errors will still enforce a <code>--resync</code> lockout, even in <code>--resilient</code> mode, to prevent data loss.</p>
<p>Behavior of <code>--resilient</code> may change in a future version. (See also: <a href="#recover"><code>--recover</code></a>, <a href="#max-lock"><code>--max-lock</code></a>, <a href="#graceful-shutdown">Graceful Shutdown</a>)</p>
<h3 id="recover">--recover</h3>
<p>If <code>--recover</code> is set, in the event of a sudden interruption or other un-graceful shutdown, bisync will attempt to automatically recover on the next run, instead of requiring <code>--resync</code>. Bisync is able to recover robustly by keeping one "backup" listing at all times, representing the state of both paths after the last known successful sync. Bisync can then compare the current state with this snapshot to determine which changes it needs to retry. Changes that were synced after this snapshot (during the run that was later interrupted) will appear to bisync as if they are "new or changed on both sides", but in most cases this is not a problem, as bisync will simply do its usual "equality check" and learn that no action needs to be taken on these files, since they are already identical on both sides.</p>
<p>In the rare event that a file is synced successfully during a run that later aborts, and then that same file changes AGAIN before the next run, bisync will think it is a sync conflict, and handle it accordingly. (From bisync's perspective, the file has changed on both sides since the last trusted sync, and the files on either side are not currently identical.) Therefore, <code>--recover</code> carries with it a slightly increased chance of having conflicts -- though in practice this is pretty rare, as the conditions required to cause it are quite specific. This risk can be reduced by using bisync's <a href="#graceful-shutdown">"Graceful Shutdown"</a> mode (triggered by sending <code>SIGINT</code> or <code>Ctrl+C</code>), when you have the choice, instead of forcing a sudden termination.</p>
<p><code>--recover</code> and <code>--resilient</code> are similar, but distinct -- the main difference is that <code>--resilient</code> is about <em>retrying</em>, while <code>--recover</code> is about <em>recovering</em>. Most users will probably want both. <code>--resilient</code> allows retrying when bisync has chosen to abort itself due to safety features such as failing <code>--check-access</code> or detecting a filter change. <code>--resilient</code> does not cover external interruptions such as a user shutting down their computer in the middle of a sync -- that is what <code>--recover</code> is for.</p>
<h3 id="max-lock">--max-lock</h3>
<p>Bisync uses <a href="#lock-file">lock files</a> as a safety feature to prevent interference from other bisync runs while it is running. Bisync normally removes these lock files at the end of a run, but if bisync is abruptly interrupted, these files will be left behind. By default, they will lock out all future runs, until the user has a chance to manually check things out and remove the lock. As an alternative, <code>--max-lock</code> can be used to make them automatically expire after a certain period of time, so that future runs are not locked out forever, and auto-recovery is possible. <code>--max-lock</code> can be any duration <code>2m</code> or greater (or <code>0</code> to disable). If set, lock files older than this will be considered "expired", and future runs will be allowed to disregard them and proceed. (Note that the <code>--max-lock</code> duration must be set by the process that left the lock file -- not the later one interpreting it.)</p>
<p>If set, bisync will also "renew" these lock files every <code>--max-lock minus one minute</code> throughout a run, for extra safety. (For example, with <code>--max-lock 5m</code>, bisync would renew the lock file (for another 5 minutes) every 4 minutes until the run has completed.) In other words, it should not be possible for a lock file to pass its expiration time while the process that created it is still running -- and you can therefore be reasonably sure that any <em>expired</em> lock file you may find was left there by an interrupted run, not one that is still running and just taking awhile.</p>
<p>If <code>--max-lock</code> is <code>0</code> or not set, the default is that lock files will never expire, and will block future runs (of these same two bisync paths) indefinitely.</p>
<p>For maximum resilience from disruptions, consider setting a relatively short duration like <code>--max-lock 2m</code> along with <a href="#resilient"><code>--resilient</code></a> and <a href="#recover"><code>--recover</code></a>, and a relatively frequent <a href="#cron">cron schedule</a>. The result will be a very robust "set-it-and-forget-it" bisync run that can automatically bounce back from almost any interruption it might encounter, without requiring the user to get involved and run a <code>--resync</code>. (See also: <a href="#graceful-shutdown">Graceful Shutdown</a> mode)</p>
<h3 id="backup-dir1-and---backup-dir2">--backup-dir1 and --backup-dir2</h3>
<p>As of <code>v1.66</code>, <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#backup-dir-dir"><code>--backup-dir</code></a> is supported in bisync. Because <code>--backup-dir</code> must be a non-overlapping path on the same remote, Bisync has introduced new <code>--backup-dir1</code> and <code>--backup-dir2</code> flags to support separate backup-dirs for <code>Path1</code> and <code>Path2</code> (bisyncing between different remotes with <code>--backup-dir</code> would not otherwise be possible.) <code>--backup-dir1</code> and <code>--backup-dir2</code> can use different remotes from each other, but <code>--backup-dir1</code> must use the same remote as <code>Path1</code>, and <code>--backup-dir2</code> must use the same remote as <code>Path2</code>. Each backup directory must not overlap its respective bisync Path without being excluded by a filter rule.</p>
<p>The standard <code>--backup-dir</code> will also work, if both paths use the same remote (but note that deleted files from both paths would be mixed together in the same dir). If either <code>--backup-dir1</code> and <code>--backup-dir2</code> are set, they will override <code>--backup-dir</code>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>rclone bisync /Users/someuser/some/local/path/Bisync gdrive:Bisync --backup-dir1 /Users/someuser/some/local/path/BackupDir --backup-dir2 gdrive:BackupDir --suffix -2023-08-26 --suffix-keep-extension --check-access --max-delete 10 --filters-file /Users/someuser/some/local/path/bisync_filters.txt --no-cleanup --ignore-listing-checksum --checkers=16 --drive-pacer-min-sleep=10ms --create-empty-src-dirs --resilient -MvP --drive-skip-gdocs --fix-case</code></pre>
<p>In this example, if the user deletes a file in <code>/Users/someuser/some/local/path/Bisync</code>, bisync will propagate the delete to the other side by moving the corresponding file from <code>gdrive:Bisync</code> to <code>gdrive:BackupDir</code>. If the user deletes a file from <code>gdrive:Bisync</code>, bisync moves it from <code>/Users/someuser/some/local/path/Bisync</code> to <code>/Users/someuser/some/local/path/BackupDir</code>.</p>
<p>In the event of a <a href="#conflict-loser">rename due to a sync conflict</a>, the rename is not considered a delete, unless a previous conflict with the same name already exists and would get overwritten.</p>

<h2 id="operation">Operation</h2>
<h3 id="runtime-flow-details">Runtime flow details</h3>
<p>bisync retains the listings of the <code>Path1</code> and <code>Path2</code> filesystems from the prior run. On each successive run it will:</p>

</table>
<p>As of <code>rclone v1.64</code>, bisync is now better at detecting <em>false positive</em> sync conflicts, which would previously have resulted in unnecessary renames and duplicates. Now, when bisync comes to a file that it wants to rename (because it is new/changed on both sides), it first checks whether the Path1 and Path2 versions are currently <em>identical</em> (using the same underlying function as <a href="commands/rclone_check/"><code>check</code></a>.) If bisync concludes that the files are identical, it will skip them and move on. Otherwise, it will create renamed duplicates, as before. This behavior also <a href="https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=Renamed%20directories">improves the experience of renaming directories</a>, as a <code>--resync</code> is no longer required, so long as the same change has been made on both sides.</p>
<h3 id="all-files-changed">All files changed check</h3>
<p>If <em>all</em> prior existing files on either of the filesystems have changed (e.g. timestamps have changed due to changing the system's timezone) then bisync will abort without making any changes. Any new files are not considered for this check. You could use <code>--force</code> to force the sync (whichever side has the changed timestamp files wins). Alternately, a <code>--resync</code> may be used (Path1 versions will be pushed to Path2). Consider the situation carefully and perhaps use <code>--dry-run</code> before you commit to the changes.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times">Modification times</h3>
<p>By default, bisync compares files by modification time and size. If you or your application should change the content of a file without changing the modification time and size, then bisync will <em>not</em> notice the change, and thus will not copy it to the other side. As an alternative, consider comparing by checksum (if your remotes support it). See <a href="#compare"><code>--compare</code></a> for details.</p>
<h3 id="error-handling">Error handling</h3>
<p>Certain bisync critical errors, such as file copy/move failing, will result in a bisync lockout of following runs. The lockout is asserted because the sync status and history of the Path1 and Path2 filesystems cannot be trusted, so it is safer to block any further changes until someone checks things out. The recovery is to do a <code>--resync</code> again.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use <code>--resync --dry-run --verbose</code> initially and <em>carefully</em> review what changes will be made before running the <code>--resync</code> without <code>--dry-run</code>.</p>
<p>Most of these events come up due to an error status from an internal call. On such a critical error the <code>{...}.path1.lst</code> and <code>{...}.path2.lst</code> listing files are renamed to extension <code>.lst-err</code>, which blocks any future bisync runs (since the normal <code>.lst</code> files are not found). Bisync keeps them under <code>bisync</code> subdirectory of the rclone cache directory, typically at <code>${HOME}/.cache/rclone/bisync/</code> on Linux.</p>
<p>Some errors are considered temporary and re-running the bisync is not blocked. The <em>critical return</em> blocks further bisync runs.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="#resilient"><code>--resilient</code></a>, <a href="#recover"><code>--recover</code></a>, <a href="#max-lock"><code>--max-lock</code></a>, <a href="#graceful-shutdown">Graceful Shutdown</a></p>
<h3 id="lock-file">Lock file</h3>
<p>When bisync is running, a lock file is created in the bisync working directory, typically at <code>~/.cache/rclone/bisync/PATH1..PATH2.lck</code> on Linux. If bisync should crash or hang, the lock file will remain in place and block any further runs of bisync <em>for the same paths</em>. Delete the lock file as part of debugging the situation. The lock file effectively blocks follow-on (e.g., scheduled by <em>cron</em>) runs when the prior invocation is taking a long time. The lock file contains <em>PID</em> of the blocking process, which may help in debug. Lock files can be set to automatically expire after a certain amount of time, using the <a href="#max-lock"><code>--max-lock</code></a> flag.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that while concurrent bisync runs are allowed, <em>be very cautious</em> that there is no overlap in the trees being synched between concurrent runs, lest there be replicated files, deleted files and general mayhem.</p>
<h3 id="exit-codes">Exit codes</h3>
<p><code>rclone bisync</code> returns the following codes to calling program: - <code>0</code> on a successful run, - <code>1</code> for a non-critical failing run (a rerun may be successful), - <code>2</code> on syntax or usage error, - <code>7</code> for a critically aborted run (requires a <code>--resync</code> to recover).</p>
<p>See also the section about <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#exit-code">exit codes</a> in main docs.</p>
<h3 id="graceful-shutdown">Graceful Shutdown</h3>
<p>Bisync has a "Graceful Shutdown" mode which is activated by sending <code>SIGINT</code> or pressing <code>Ctrl+C</code> during a run. Once triggered, bisync will use best efforts to exit cleanly before the timer runs out. If bisync is in the middle of transferring files, it will attempt to cleanly empty its queue by finishing what it has started but not taking more. If it cannot do so within 30 seconds, it will cancel the in-progress transfers at that point and then give itself a maximum of 60 seconds to wrap up, save its state for next time, and exit. With the <code>-vP</code> flags you will see constant status updates and a final confirmation of whether or not the graceful shutdown was successful.</p>
<p>At any point during the "Graceful Shutdown" sequence, a second <code>SIGINT</code> or <code>Ctrl+C</code> will trigger an immediate, un-graceful exit, which will leave things in a messier state. Usually a robust recovery will still be possible if using <a href="#recover"><code>--recover</code></a> mode, otherwise you will need to do a <code>--resync</code>.</p>
<p>If you plan to use Graceful Shutdown mode, it is recommended to use <a href="#resilient"><code>--resilient</code></a> and <a href="#recover"><code>--recover</code></a>, and it is important to NOT use <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#inplace"><code>--inplace</code></a>, otherwise you risk leaving partially-written files on one side, which may be confused for real files on the next run. Note also that in the event of an abrupt interruption, a <a href="#lock-file">lock file</a> will be left behind to block concurrent runs. You will need to delete it before you can proceed with the next run (or wait for it to expire on its own, if using <code>--max-lock</code>.)</p>
<h2 id="limitations-4">Limitations</h2>
<h3 id="supported-backends">Supported backends</h3>
<p>Bisync is considered <em>BETA</em> and has been tested with the following backends: - Local filesystem - Google Drive - Dropbox - OneDrive - S3 - SFTP - Yandex Disk - Crypt</p>
<p>It has not been fully tested with other services yet. If it works, or sorta works, please let us know and we'll update the list. Run the test suite to check for proper operation as described below.</p>
<p>The first release of <code>rclone bisync</code> required both underlying backends to support modification times, and refused to run otherwise. This limitation has been lifted as of <code>v1.66</code>, as bisync now supports comparing checksum and/or size instead of (or in addition to) modtime. See <a href="#compare"><code>--compare</code></a> for details.</p>
<h3 id="concurrent-modifications">Concurrent modifications</h3>
<p>When using <strong>Local, FTP or SFTP</strong> remotes with <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#inplace"><code>--inplace</code></a>, rclone does not create <em>temporary</em> files at the destination when copying, and thus if the connection is lost the created file may be corrupt, which will likely propagate back to the original path on the next sync, resulting in data loss. It is therefore recommended to <em>omit</em> <code>--inplace</code>.</p>
<p>Files that <strong>change during</strong> a bisync run may result in data loss. Prior to <code>rclone v1.66</code>, this was commonly seen in highly dynamic environments, where the filesystem was getting hammered by running processes during the sync. As of <code>rclone v1.66</code>, bisync was redesigned to use a "snapshot" model, greatly reducing the risks from changes during a sync. Changes that are not detected during the current sync will now be detected during the following sync, and will no longer cause the entire run to throw a critical error. There is additionally a mechanism to mark files as needing to be internally rechecked next time, for added safety. It should therefore no longer be necessary to sync only at quiet times -- however, note that an error can still occur if a file happens to change at the exact moment it's being read/written by bisync (same as would happen in <code>rclone sync</code>.) (See also: <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#ignore-checksum"><code>--ignore-checksum</code></a>, <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#local-no-check-updated"><code>--local-no-check-updated</code></a>)</p>
<h3 id="empty-directories">Empty directories</h3>
<p>By default, new/deleted empty directories on one path are <em>not</em> propagated to the other side. This is because bisync (and rclone) natively works on files, not directories. However, this can be changed with the <code>--create-empty-src-dirs</code> flag, which works in much the same way as in <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/"><code>sync</code></a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/"><code>copy</code></a>. When used, empty directories created or deleted on one side will also be created or deleted on the other side. The following should be noted: * <code>--create-empty-src-dirs</code> is not compatible with <code>--remove-empty-dirs</code>. Use only one or the other (or neither). * It is not recommended to switch back and forth between <code>--create-empty-src-dirs</code> and the default (no <code>--create-empty-src-dirs</code>) without running <code>--resync</code>. This is because it may appear as though all directories (not just the empty ones) were created/deleted, when actually you've just toggled between making them visible/invisible to bisync. It looks scarier than it is, but it's still probably best to stick to one or the other, and use <code>--resync</code> when you need to switch.</p>
<h3 id="renamed-directories">Renamed directories</h3>
<p>By default, renaming a folder on the Path1 side results in deleting all files on the Path2 side and then copying all files again from Path1 to Path2. Bisync sees this as all files in the old directory name as deleted and all files in the new directory name as new.</p>
<p>A recommended solution is to use <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#track-renames"><code>--track-renames</code></a>, which is now supported in bisync as of <code>rclone v1.66</code>. Note that <code>--track-renames</code> is not available during <code>--resync</code>, as <code>--resync</code> does not delete anything (<code>--track-renames</code> only supports <code>sync</code>, not <code>copy</code>.)</p>
<p>Otherwise, the most effective and efficient method of renaming a directory is to rename it to the same name on both sides. (As of <code>rclone v1.64</code>, a <code>--resync</code> is no longer required after doing so, as bisync will automatically detect that Path1 and Path2 are in agreement.)</p>
<h3 id="fast-list-used-by-default"><code>--fast-list</code> used by default</h3>
<p>Unlike most other rclone commands, bisync uses <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list"><code>--fast-list</code></a> by default, for backends that support it. In many cases this is desirable, however, there are some scenarios in which bisync could be faster <em>without</em> <code>--fast-list</code>, and there is also a <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/cbf3d4356135814921382dd3285d859d15d0aa77">known issue concerning Google Drive users with many empty directories</a>. For now, the recommended way to avoid using <code>--fast-list</code> is to add <code>--disable ListR</code> to all bisync commands. The default behavior may change in a future version.</p>
<h3 id="case-sensitivity">Case (and unicode) sensitivity</h3>
<p>As of <code>v1.66</code>, case and unicode form differences no longer cause critical errors, and normalization (when comparing between filesystems) is handled according to the same flags and defaults as <code>rclone sync</code>. See the following options (all of which are supported by bisync) to control this behavior more granularly: - <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#fix-case"><code>--fix-case</code></a> - <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#ignore-case-sync"><code>--ignore-case-sync</code></a> - <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#no-unicode-normalization"><code>--no-unicode-normalization</code></a> - <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#local-unicode-normalization"><code>--local-unicode-normalization</code></a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#local-case-sensitive"><code>--local-case-sensitive</code></a> (caution: these are normally not what you want.)</p>
<p>Note that in the (probably rare) event that <code>--fix-case</code> is used AND a file is new/changed on both sides AND the checksums match AND the filename case does not match, the Path1 filename is considered the winner, for the purposes of <code>--fix-case</code> (Path2 will be renamed to match it).</p>
<h2 id="windows">Windows support</h2>
<p>Bisync has been tested on Windows 8.1, Windows 10 Pro 64-bit and on Windows GitHub runners.</p>
<p>Drive letters are allowed, including drive letters mapped to network drives (<code>rclone bisync J:\localsync GDrive:</code>). If a drive letter is omitted, the shell current drive is the default. Drive letters are a single character follows by <code>:</code>, so cloud names must be more than one character long.</p>
<p>Absolute paths (with or without a drive letter), and relative paths (with or without a drive letter) are supported.</p>
<p>Working directory is created at <code>C:\Users\MyLogin\AppData\Local\rclone\bisync</code>.</p>
<p>Note that bisync output may show a mix of forward <code>/</code> and back <code>\</code> slashes.</p>
<p>Be careful of case independent directory and file naming on Windows vs. case dependent Linux</p>
<h2 id="filtering">Filtering</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/filtering/">filtering documentation</a> for how filter rules are written and interpreted.</p>
<p>Bisync's <a href="#filters-file"><code>--filters-file</code></a> flag slightly extends the rclone's <a href="https://rclone.org/filtering/#filter-from-read-filtering-patterns-from-a-file">--filter-from</a> filtering mechanism. For a given bisync run you may provide <em>only one</em> <code>--filters-file</code>. The <code>--include*</code>, <code>--exclude*</code>, and <code>--filter</code> flags are also supported.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-filter-directories">How to filter directories</h3>
<p>Filtering portions of the directory tree is a critical feature for syncing.</p>
<p>Examples of directory trees (always beneath the Path1/Path2 root level) you may want to exclude from your sync: - Directory trees containing only software build intermediate files. - Directory trees containing application temporary files and data such as the Windows <code>C:\Users\MyLogin\AppData\</code> tree. - Directory trees containing files that are large, less important, or are getting thrashed continuously by ongoing processes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there may be only select directories that you actually want to sync, and exclude all others. See the <a href="#include-filters">Example include-style filters for Windows user directories</a> below.</p>
<h3 id="filters-file-writing-guidelines">Filters file writing guidelines</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Begin with excluding directory trees:
<ul>
<li>e.g. `- /AppData/`</li>
<li><code>**</code> on the end is not necessary. Once a given directory level is excluded then everything beneath it won't be looked at by rclone.</li>
<li>Exclude such directories that are unneeded, are big, dynamically thrashed, or where there may be access permission issues.</li>
<li>Excluding such dirs first will make rclone operations (much) faster.</li>
<li>Specific files may also be excluded, as with the Dropbox exclusions example below.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decide if it's easier (or cleaner) to:
<ul>
<li>Include select directories and therefore <em>exclude everything else</em> -- or --</li>
<li>Exclude select directories and therefore <em>include everything else</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Include select directories:
<ul>
<li>Add lines like: `+ /Documents/PersonalFiles/**` to select which directories to include in the sync.</li>
<li><code>**</code> on the end specifies to include the full depth of the specified tree.</li>
<li>With Include-style filters, files at the Path1/Path2 root are not included. They may be included with `+ /*`.</li>
<li>Place RCLONE_TEST files within these included directory trees. They will only be looked for in these directory trees.</li>
<li>Finish by excluding everything else by adding `- **` at the end of the filters file.</li>
<li>Disregard step 4.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Exclude select directories:
<ul>
<li>Add more lines like in step 1. For example: <code>-/Desktop/tempfiles/</code>, or `- /testdir/<code>.    Again, a</code>**` on the end is not necessary.</li>
<li>Do <em>not</em> add a `- **` in the file. Without this line, everything will be included that has not been explicitly excluded.</li>
<li>Disregard step 3.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>A few rules for the syntax of a filter file expanding on <a href="https://rclone.org/filtering/">filtering documentation</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines may start with spaces and tabs - rclone strips leading whitespace.</li>
<li>If the first non-whitespace character is a <code>#</code> then the line is a comment and will be ignored.</li>
<li>Blank lines are ignored.</li>
<li>The first non-whitespace character on a filter line must be a <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>.</li>
<li>Exactly 1 space is allowed between the <code>+/-</code> and the path term.</li>
<li>Only forward slashes (<code>/</code>) are used in path terms, even on Windows.</li>
<li>The rest of the line is taken as the path term. Trailing whitespace is taken literally, and probably is an error.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="include-filters">Example include-style filters for Windows user directories</h3>
<p>This Windows <em>include-style</em> example is based on the sync root (Path1) set to <code>C:\Users\MyLogin</code>. The strategy is to select specific directories to be synched with a network drive (Path2).</p>
<ul>
<li>`- /AppData/` excludes an entire tree of Windows stored stuff that need not be synched. In my case, AppData has &gt;11 GB of stuff I don't care about, and there are some subdirectories beneath AppData that are not accessible to my user login, resulting in bisync critical aborts.</li>
<li>Windows creates cache files starting with both upper and lowercase <code>NTUSER</code> at <code>C:\Users\MyLogin</code>. These files may be dynamic, locked, and are generally <em>don't care</em>.</li>
<li>There are just a few directories with <em>my</em> data that I do want synched, in the form of `+ /<path><code>. By selecting only the directory trees I   want to avoid the dozen plus directories that various apps make   at</code>C:`.</li>
<li>Include files in the root of the sync point, <code>C:\Users\MyLogin</code>, by adding the `+ /*` line.</li>
<li>This is an Include-style filters file, therefore it ends with `- **` which excludes everything not explicitly included.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>- /AppData/
- NTUSER*
- ntuser*
+ /Documents/Family/**
+ /Documents/Sketchup/**
+ /Documents/Microcapture_Photo/**
+ /Documents/Microcapture_Video/**
+ /Desktop/**
+ /Pictures/**
+ /*
- **</code></pre>
<p>Note also that Windows implements several "library" links such as <code>C:\Users\MyLogin\My Documents\My Music</code> pointing to <code>C:\Users\MyLogin\Music</code>. rclone sees these as links, so you must add <code>--links</code> to the bisync command line if you which to follow these links. I find that I get permission errors in trying to follow the links, so I don't include the rclone <code>--links</code> flag, but then you get lots of <code>Can't follow symlink…</code> noise from rclone about not following the links. This noise can be quashed by adding <code>--quiet</code> to the bisync command line.</p>
<h2 id="exclude-filters">Example exclude-style filters files for use with Dropbox</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dropbox disallows syncing the listed temporary and configuration/data files. The `- <filename>` filters exclude these files where ever they may occur in the sync tree. Consider adding similar exclusions for file types you don't need to sync, such as core dump and software build files.</li>
<li>bisync testing creates <code>/testdir/</code> at the top level of the sync tree, and usually deletes the tree after the test. If a normal sync should run while the <code>/testdir/</code> tree exists the <code>--check-access</code> phase may fail due to unbalanced RCLONE_TEST files. The `- /testdir/` filter blocks this tree from being synched. You don't need this exclusion if you are not doing bisync development testing.</li>
<li>Everything else beneath the Path1/Path2 root will be synched.</li>
<li>RCLONE_TEST files may be placed anywhere within the tree, including the root.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how---check-access-handles-filters">How --check-access handles filters</h3>
<p>At the start of a bisync run, listings are gathered for Path1 and Path2 while using the user's <code>--filters-file</code>. During the check access phase, bisync scans these listings for <code>RCLONE_TEST</code> files. Any <code>RCLONE_TEST</code> files hidden by the <code>--filters-file</code> are <em>not</em> in the listings and thus not checked during the check access phase.</p>

<h3 id="dry-run-oddity">Dry run oddity</h3>
<p>The <code>--dry-run</code> messages may indicate that it would try to delete some files. For example, if a file is new on Path2 and does not exist on Path1 then it would normally be copied to Path1, but with <code>--dry-run</code> enabled those copies don't happen, which leads to the attempted delete on Path2, blocked again by --dry-run: <code>... Not deleting as --dry-run</code>.</p>
<p>This whole confusing situation is an artifact of the <code>--dry-run</code> flag. Scrutinize the proposed deletes carefully, and if the files would have been copied to Path1 then the threatened deletes on Path2 may be disregarded.</p>
<h3 id="retries">Retries</h3>
<p>Rclone has built-in retries. If you run with <code>--verbose</code> you'll see error and retry messages such as shown below. This is usually not a bug. If at the end of the run, you see <code>Bisync successful</code> and not <code>Bisync critical error</code> or <code>Bisync aborted</code> then the run was successful, and you can ignore the error messages.</p>
<p>The following run shows an intermittent fail. Lines <em>5</em> and _6- are low-level messages. Line <em>6</em> is a bubbled-up <em>warning</em> message, conveying the error. Rclone normally retries failing commands, so there may be numerous such messages in the log.</p>
<p>Since there are no final error/warning messages on line <em>7</em>, rclone has recovered from failure after a retry, and the overall sync was successful.</p>

<h3 id="denied-downloads-of-infected-or-abusive-files">Denied downloads of "infected" or "abusive" files</h3>
<p>Google Drive has a filter for certain file types (<code>.exe</code>, <code>.apk</code>, et cetera) that by default cannot be copied from Google Drive to the local filesystem. If you are having problems, run with <code>--verbose</code> to see specifically which files are generating complaints. If the error is <code>This file has been identified as malware or spam and cannot be downloaded</code>, consider using the flag <a href="https://rclone.org/drive/#drive-acknowledge-abuse">--drive-acknowledge-abuse</a>.</p>
<h3 id="gdocs">Google Docs (and other files of unknown size)</h3>
<p>As of <code>v1.66</code>, <a href="https://rclone.org/drive/#import-export-of-google-documents">Google Docs</a> (including Google Sheets, Slides, etc.) are now supported in bisync, subject to the same options, defaults, and limitations as in <code>rclone sync</code>. When bisyncing drive with non-drive backends, the drive -&gt; non-drive direction is controlled by <a href="https://rclone.org/drive/#drive-export-formats"><code>--drive-export-formats</code></a> (default <code>"docx,xlsx,pptx,svg"</code>) and the non-drive -&gt; drive direction is controlled by <a href="https://rclone.org/drive/#drive-import-formats"><code>--drive-import-formats</code></a> (default none.)</p>
<p>For example, with the default export/import formats, a Google Sheet on the drive side will be synced to an <code>.xlsx</code> file on the non-drive side. In the reverse direction, <code>.xlsx</code> files with filenames that match an existing Google Sheet will be synced to that Google Sheet, while <code>.xlsx</code> files that do NOT match an existing Google Sheet will be copied to drive as normal <code>.xlsx</code> files (without conversion to Sheets, although the Google Drive web browser UI may still give you the option to open it as one.)</p>
<p>If <code>--drive-import-formats</code> is set (it's not, by default), then all of the specified formats will be converted to Google Docs, if there is no existing Google Doc with a matching name. Caution: such conversion can be quite lossy, and in most cases it's probably not what you want!</p>
<p>To bisync Google Docs as URL shortcut links (in a manner similar to "Drive for Desktop"), use: <code>--drive-export-formats url</code> (or <a href="https://rclone.org/drive/#exportformats:~:text=available%20Google%20Documents.-,Extension,macOS,-Standard%20options">alternatives</a>.)</p>
<p>Note that these link files cannot be edited on the non-drive side -- you will get errors if you try to sync an edited link file back to drive. They CAN be deleted (it will result in deleting the corresponding Google Doc.) If you create a <code>.url</code> file on the non-drive side that does not match an existing Google Doc, bisyncing it will just result in copying the literal <code>.url</code> file over to drive (no Google Doc will be created.) So, as a general rule of thumb, think of them as read-only placeholders on the non-drive side, and make all your changes on the drive side.</p>
<p>Likewise, even with other export-formats, it is best to only move/rename Google Docs on the drive side. This is because otherwise, bisync will interpret this as a file deleted and another created, and accordingly, it will delete the Google Doc and create a new file at the new path. (Whether or not that new file is a Google Doc depends on <code>--drive-import-formats</code>.)</p>
<p>Lastly, take note that all Google Docs on the drive side have a size of <code>-1</code> and no checksum. Therefore, they cannot be reliably synced with the <code>--checksum</code> or <code>--size-only</code> flags. (To be exact: they will still get created/deleted, and bisync's delta engine will notice changes and queue them for syncing, but the underlying sync function will consider them identical and skip them.) To work around this, use the default (modtime and size) instead of <code>--checksum</code> or <code>--size-only</code>.</p>
<p>To ignore Google Docs entirely, use <a href="https://rclone.org/drive/#drive-skip-gdocs"><code>--drive-skip-gdocs</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="usage-examples">Usage examples</h2>
<h3 id="cron">Cron</h3>
<p>Rclone does not yet have a built-in capability to monitor the local file system for changes and must be blindly run periodically. On Windows this can be done using a <em>Task Scheduler</em>, on Linux you can use <em>Cron</em> which is described below.</p>
<p>The 1st example runs a sync every 5 minutes between a local directory and an OwnCloud server, with output logged to a runlog file:</p>
<pre><code># Minute (0-59)
#      Hour (0-23)
#           Day of Month (1-31)
#                Month (1-12 or Jan-Dec)
#                     Day of Week (0-6 or Sun-Sat)
#                         Command
  */5  *    *    *    *   /path/to/rclone bisync /local/files MyCloud: --check-access --filters-file /path/to/bysync-filters.txt --log-file /path/to//bisync.log</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/crontab.1p.html#INPUT_FILES">crontab syntax</a> for the details of crontab time interval expressions.</p>
<p>If you run <code>rclone bisync</code> as a cron job, redirect stdout/stderr to a file. The 2nd example runs a sync to Dropbox every hour and logs all stdout (via the <code>&gt;&gt;</code>) and stderr (via <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code>) to a log file.</p>
<pre><code>0 * * * * /path/to/rclone bisync /path/to/local/dropbox Dropbox: --check-access --filters-file /home/user/filters.txt &gt;&gt; /path/to/logs/dropbox-run.log 2&gt;&amp;1</code></pre>
<h3 id="sharing-an-encrypted-folder-tree-between-hosts">Sharing an encrypted folder tree between hosts</h3>
<p>bisync can keep a local folder in sync with a cloud service, but what if you have some highly sensitive files to be synched?</p>
<p>Usage of a cloud service is for exchanging both routine and sensitive personal files between one's home network, one's personal notebook when on the road, and with one's work computer. The routine data is not sensitive. For the sensitive data, configure an rclone <a href="https://rclone.org/crypt/">crypt remote</a> to point to a subdirectory within the local disk tree that is bisync'd to Dropbox, and then set up an bisync for this local crypt directory to a directory outside of the main sync tree.</p>
<h3 id="linux-server-setup">Linux server setup</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>/path/to/DBoxroot</code> is the root of my local sync tree. There are numerous subdirectories.</li>
<li><code>/path/to/DBoxroot/crypt</code> is the root subdirectory for files that are encrypted. This local directory target is setup as an rclone crypt remote named <code>Dropcrypt:</code>. See <a href="#rclone-conf-snippet">rclone.conf</a> snippet below.</li>
<li><code>/path/to/my/unencrypted/files</code> is the root of my sensitive files - not encrypted, not within the tree synched to Dropbox.</li>
<li>To sync my local unencrypted files with the encrypted Dropbox versions I manually run <code>bisync /path/to/my/unencrypted/files DropCrypt:</code>. This step could be bundled into a script to run before and after the full Dropbox tree sync in the last step, thus actively keeping the sensitive files in sync.</li>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>You should read this section only if you are developing for rclone. You need to have rclone source code locally to work with bisync tests.</p>
<p>Bisync has a dedicated test framework implemented in the <code>bisync_test.go</code> file located in the rclone source tree. The test suite is based on the <code>go test</code> command. Series of tests are stored in subdirectories below the <code>cmd/bisync/testdata</code> directory. Individual tests can be invoked by their directory name, e.g. <code>go test . -case basic -remote local -remote2 gdrive: -v</code></p>
<p>Tests will make a temporary folder on remote and purge it afterwards. If during test run there are intermittent errors and rclone retries, these errors will be captured and flagged as invalid MISCOMPAREs. Rerunning the test will let it pass. Consider such failures as noise.</p>
<h3 id="test-command-syntax">Test command syntax</h3>
<pre><code>usage: go test ./cmd/bisync [options...]

Options:
  -case NAME        Name(s) of the test case(s) to run. Multiple names should
                    be separated by commas. You can remove the `test_` prefix
                    and replace `_` by `-` in test name for convenience.
                    If not `all`, the name(s) should map to a directory under
                    `./cmd/bisync/testdata`.
                    Use `all` to run all tests (default: all)
  -remote PATH1     `local` or name of cloud service with `:` (default: local)
  -remote2 PATH2    `local` or name of cloud service with `:` (default: local)
  -no-compare       Disable comparing test results with the golden directory
                    (default: compare)
  -no-cleanup       Disable cleanup of Path1 and Path2 testdirs.
                    Useful for troubleshooting. (default: cleanup)
  -golden           Store results in the golden directory (default: false)
                    This flag can be used with multiple tests.
  -debug            Print debug messages
  -stop-at NUM      Stop test after given step number. (default: run to the end)
                    Implies `-no-compare` and `-no-cleanup`, if the test really
                    ends prematurely. Only meaningful for a single test case.
  -refresh-times    Force refreshing the target modtime, useful for Dropbox
                    (default: false)
  -verbose          Run tests verbosely</code></pre>
<p>Note: unlike rclone flags which must be prefixed by double dash (<code>--</code>), the test command flags can be equally prefixed by a single <code>-</code> or double dash.</p>
<h3 id="running-tests">Running tests</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>go test . -case basic -remote local -remote2 local</code> runs the <code>test_basic</code> test case using only the local filesystem, syncing one local directory with another local directory. Test script output is to the console, while commands within scenario.txt have their output sent to the <code>.../workdir/test.log</code> file, which is finally compared to the golden copy.</li>
<li>The first argument after <code>go test</code> should be a relative name of the directory containing bisync source code. If you run tests right from there, the argument will be <code>.</code> (current directory) as in most examples below. If you run bisync tests from the rclone source directory, the command should be <code>go test ./cmd/bisync ...</code>.</li>
<li>The test engine will mangle rclone output to ensure comparability with golden listings and logs.</li>
<li>Test scenarios are located in <code>./cmd/bisync/testdata</code>. The test <code>-case</code> argument should match the full name of a subdirectory under that directory. Every test subdirectory name on disk must start with <code>test_</code>, this prefix can be omitted on command line for brevity. Also, underscores in the name can be replaced by dashes for convenience.</li>
<li><code>go test . -remote local -remote2 local -case all</code> runs all tests.</li>
<li>Path1 and Path2 may either be the keyword <code>local</code> or may be names of configured cloud services. <code>go test . -remote gdrive: -remote2 dropbox: -case basic</code> will run the test between these two services, without transferring any files to the local filesystem.</li>
<li>Test run stdout and stderr console output may be directed to a file, e.g. <code>go test . -remote gdrive: -remote2 local -case all &gt; runlog.txt 2&gt;&amp;1</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test-execution-flow">Test execution flow</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>The base setup in the <code>initial</code> directory of the testcase is applied on the Path1 and Path2 filesystems (via rclone copy the initial directory to Path1, then rclone sync Path1 to Path2).</li>
<li>The commands in the scenario.txt file are applied, with output directed to the <code>test.log</code> file in the test working directory. Typically, the first actual command in the <code>scenario.txt</code> file is to do a <code>--resync</code>, which establishes the baseline <code>{...}.path1.lst</code> and <code>{...}.path2.lst</code> files in the test working directory (<code>.../workdir/</code> relative to the temporary test directory). Various commands and listing snapshots are done within the test.</li>
<li>Finally, the contents of the test working directory are compared to the contents of the testcase's golden directory.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="notes-about-testing">Notes about testing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Test cases are in individual directories beneath <code>./cmd/bisync/testdata</code>. A command line reference to a test is understood to reference a directory beneath <code>testdata</code>. For example, <code>go test ./cmd/bisync -case dry-run -remote gdrive: -remote2 local</code> refers to the test case in <code>./cmd/bisync/testdata/test_dry_run</code>.</li>
<li>The test working directory is located at <code>.../workdir</code> relative to a temporary test directory, usually under <code>/tmp</code> on Linux.</li>
<li>The local test sync tree is created at a temporary directory named like <code>bisync.XXX</code> under system temporary directory.</li>
<li>The remote test sync tree is located at a temporary directory under <code>&lt;remote:&gt;/bisync.XXX/</code>.</li>
<li><code>path1</code> and/or <code>path2</code> subdirectories are created in a temporary directory under the respective local or cloud test remote.</li>
<li>By default, the Path1 and Path2 test dirs and workdir will be deleted after each test run. The <code>-no-cleanup</code> flag disables purging these directories when validating and debugging a given test. These directories will be flushed before running another test, independent of the <code>-no-cleanup</code> usage.</li>
<li>You will likely want to add `- /testdir/<code>to your normal   bisync</code>--filters-file<code>so that normal syncs do not attempt to sync   the test temporary directories, which may have</code>RCLONE_TEST<code>miscompares   in some testcases which would otherwise trip the</code>--check-access<code>system.   The</code>--check-access<code>mechanism is hard-coded to ignore</code>RCLONE_TEST<code>files beneath</code>bisync/testdata`, so the test cases may reside on the synched tree even if there are check file mismatches in the test tree.</li>
<li>Some Dropbox tests can fail, notably printing the following message: <code>src and dst identical but can't set mod time without deleting and re-uploading</code> This is expected and happens due to the way Dropbox handles modification times. You should use the <code>-refresh-times</code> test flag to make up for this.</li>
<li>If Dropbox tests hit request limit for you and print error message <code>too_many_requests/...: Too many requests or write operations.</code> then follow the <a href="https://rclone.org/dropbox/#get-your-own-dropbox-app-id">Dropbox App ID instructions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="updating-golden-results">Updating golden results</h3>
<p>Sometimes even a slight change in the bisync source can cause little changes spread around many log files. Updating them manually would be a nightmare.</p>
<p>The <code>-golden</code> flag will store the <code>test.log</code> and <code>*.lst</code> listings from each test case into respective golden directories. Golden results will automatically contain generic strings instead of local or cloud paths which means that they should match when run with a different cloud service.</p>
<p>Your normal workflow might be as follows: 1. Git-clone the rclone sources locally 2. Modify bisync source and check that it builds 3. Run the whole test suite <code>go test ./cmd/bisync -remote local</code> 4. If some tests show log difference, recheck them individually, e.g.: <code>go test ./cmd/bisync -remote local -case basic</code> 5. If you are convinced with the difference, goldenize all tests at once: <code>go test ./cmd/bisync -remote local -golden</code> 6. Use word diff: <code>git diff --word-diff ./cmd/bisync/testdata/</code>. Please note that normal line-level diff is generally useless here. 7. Check the difference <em>carefully</em>! 8. Commit the change (<code>git commit</code>) <em>only</em> if you are sure. If unsure, save your code changes then wipe the log diffs from git: <code>git reset [--hard]</code>.</p>
<h3 id="structure-of-test-scenarios">Structure of test scenarios</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;testname&gt;/initial/</code> contains a tree of files that will be set as the initial condition on both Path1 and Path2 testdirs.</li>
<li><code>&lt;testname&gt;/modfiles/</code> contains files that will be used to modify the Path1 and/or Path2 filesystems.</li>
<li><code>&lt;testname&gt;/golden/</code> contains the expected content of the test working directory (<code>workdir</code>) at the completion of the testcase.</li>
<li><code>&lt;testname&gt;/scenario.txt</code> contains the body of the test, in the form of various commands to modify files, run bisync, and snapshot listings. Output from these commands is captured to <code>.../workdir/test.log</code> for comparison to the golden files.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="supported-test-commands">Supported test commands</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>test &lt;some message&gt;</code> Print the line to the console and to the <code>test.log</code>: <code>test sync is working correctly with options x, y, z</code></li>

<li><code>move-listings &lt;prefix&gt;</code> Similar to <code>copy-listings</code> but removes the source</li>
<li><code>purge-children &lt;dir&gt;</code> This will delete all child files and purge all child subdirs under given directory but keep the parent intact. This behavior is important for tests with Google Drive because removing and re-creating the parent would change its ID.</li>
<li><code>delete-file &lt;file&gt;</code> Delete a single file.</li>
<li><code>delete-glob &lt;dir&gt; &lt;pattern&gt;</code> Delete a group of files located one level deep in the given directory with names matching a given glob pattern.</li>

<li><code>touch-copy YYYY-MM-DD &lt;source-file&gt; &lt;dest-dir&gt;</code> Change file modification time then copy it to destination.</li>
<li><code>copy-file &lt;source-file&gt; &lt;dest-dir&gt;</code> Copy a single file to given directory.</li>
<li><code>copy-as &lt;source-file&gt; &lt;dest-file&gt;</code> Similar to above but destination must include both directory and the new file name at destination.</li>
<li><code>copy-dir &lt;src&gt; &lt;dst&gt;</code> and <code>sync-dir &lt;src&gt; &lt;dst&gt;</code> Copy/sync a directory. Equivalent of <code>rclone copy</code> and <code>rclone sync</code>.</li>

<li><code>bisync [options]</code> Runs bisync against <code>-remote</code> and <code>-remote2</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="supported-substitution-terms">Supported substitution terms</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>{testdir/}</code> - the root dir of the testcase</li>
<li><code>{datadir/}</code> - the <code>modfiles</code> dir under the testcase root</li>
<li><code>{workdir/}</code> - the temporary test working directory</li>
<li><code>{path1/}</code> - the root of the Path1 test directory tree</li>
<li><code>{path2/}</code> - the root of the Path2 test directory tree</li>
<li><code>{session}</code> - base name of the test listings</li>

<li><code>{chr:HH}</code> - raw byte with given hexadecimal code</li>
</ul>
<p>Substitution results of the terms named like <code>{dir/}</code> will end with <code>/</code> (or backslash on Windows), so it is not necessary to include slash in the usage, for example <code>delete-file {path1/}file1.txt</code>.</p>

<p>This next data is from a user's application. They had ~400GB of data over 1.96 million files being sync'ed between a Windows local disk and some remote cloud. The file full path length was on average 35 characters (which factors into load time and RAM required).</p>
<ul>
<li>Loading the prior listing into memory (1.96 million files, listing file size 140 MB) took ~30 sec and occupied about 1 GB of RAM.</li>
<li>Getting a fresh listing of the local file system (producing the 140 MB output file) took about XXX sec.</li>
<li>Getting a fresh listing of the remote file system (producing the 140 MB output file) took about XXX sec. The network download speed was measured at XXX Mb/s.</li>
<li>Once the prior and current Path1 and Path2 listings were loaded (a total of four to be loaded, two at a time), determining the deltas was pretty quick (a few seconds for this test case), and the transfer time for any files to be copied was dominated by the network bandwidth.</li>

<h3 id="download-the-files">Download the files</h3>
<p>The first step is to download the binary and SUMs file and verify that the SUMs you have downloaded match. Here we download <code>rclone-v1.63.1-windows-amd64.zip</code> - choose the binary (or binaries) appropriate to your architecture. We've also chosen the <code>SHA256SUMS</code> as these are the most secure. You could verify the other types of hash also for extra security. <code>rclone selfupdate</code> verifies just the <code>SHA256SUMS</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir /tmp/check
$ cd /tmp/check
$ rclone copy --http-url https://downloads.rclone.org/v1.63.1 :http:SHA256SUMS .
$ rclone copy --http-url https://downloads.rclone.org/v1.63.1 :http:rclone-v1.63.1-windows-amd64.zip .</code></pre>
<h3 id="verify-the-signatures">Verify the signatures</h3>
<p>First verify the signatures on the SHA256 file.</p>
<p>Import the key. See above for ways to verify this key is correct.</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --receive-keys FBF737ECE9F8AB18604BD2AC93935E02FF3B54FA
gpg: key 93935E02FF3B54FA: public key &quot;Nick Craig-Wood &lt;nick@craig-wood.com&gt;&quot; imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1</code></pre>
<p>Then check the signature:</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg --verify SHA256SUMS 
gpg: Signature made Mon 17 Jul 2023 15:03:17 BST
gpg:                using DSA key FBF737ECE9F8AB18604BD2AC93935E02FF3B54FA
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Nick Craig-Wood &lt;nick@craig-wood.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]</code></pre>
<p>Verify the signature was good and is using the fingerprint shown above.</p>
<p>Repeat for <code>MD5SUMS</code> and <code>SHA1SUMS</code> if desired.</p>
<h3 id="verify-the-hashes">Verify the hashes</h3>
<p>Now that we know the signatures on the hashes are OK we can verify the binaries match the hashes, completing the verification.</p>
<pre><code>$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep OK
rclone-v1.63.1-windows-amd64.zip: OK</code></pre>
<p>Or do the check with rclone</p>

<h2 id="limitations-5">Limitations</h2>
<p><code>rclone about</code> is not supported by the 1Fichier backend. Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy <code>mfs</code> (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">List of backends that do not support rclone about</a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/">rclone about</a></p>
<h1 id="alias">Alias</h1>
<p>The <code>alias</code> remote provides a new name for another remote.</p>
<p>Paths may be as deep as required or a local path, e.g. <code>remote:directory/subdirectory</code> or <code>/directory/subdirectory</code>.</p>
<p>During the initial setup with <code>rclone config</code> you will specify the target remote. The target remote can either be a local path or another remote.</p>
<p>Subfolders can be used in target remote. Assume an alias remote named <code>backup</code> with the target <code>mydrive:private/backup</code>. Invoking <code>rclone mkdir backup:desktop</code> is exactly the same as invoking <code>rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/desktop</code>.</p>
<p>There will be no special handling of paths containing <code>..</code> segments. Invoking <code>rclone mkdir backup:../desktop</code> is exactly the same as invoking <code>rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/../desktop</code>. The empty path is not allowed as a remote. To alias the current directory use <code>.</code> instead.</p>
<p>The target remote can also be a <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#connection-strings">connection string</a>. This can be used to modify the config of a remote for different uses, e.g. the alias <code>myDriveTrash</code> with the target remote <code>myDrive,trashed_only:</code> can be used to only show the trashed files in <code>myDrive</code>.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-1">Configuration</h2>
<p>Here is an example of how to make an alias called <code>remote</code> for local folder. First run:</p>
<pre><code> rclone config</code></pre>

<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-1">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<h4 id="modification-times-1">Modification times</h4>
<p>The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as <code>X-Amz-Meta-Mtime</code> as floating point since the epoch, accurate to 1 ns.</p>
<p>If the modification time needs to be updated rclone will attempt to perform a server side copy to update the modification if the object can be copied in a single part. In the case the object is larger than 5Gb or is in Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive storage the object will be uploaded rather than copied.</p>
<p>Note that reading this from the object takes an additional <code>HEAD</code> request as the metadata isn't returned in object listings.</p>
<h4 id="hashes">Hashes</h4>
<p>For small objects which weren't uploaded as multipart uploads (objects sized below <code>--s3-upload-cutoff</code> if uploaded with rclone) rclone uses the <code>ETag:</code> header as an MD5 checksum.</p>
<p>However for objects which were uploaded as multipart uploads or with server side encryption (SSE-AWS or SSE-C) the <code>ETag</code> header is no longer the MD5 sum of the data, so rclone adds an additional piece of metadata <code>X-Amz-Meta-Md5chksum</code> which is a base64 encoded MD5 hash (in the same format as is required for <code>Content-MD5</code>). You can use base64 -d and hexdump to check this value manually:</p>
<pre><code>echo &#39;VWTGdNx3LyXQDfA0e2Edxw==&#39; | base64 -d | hexdump</code></pre>
<p>or you can use <code>rclone check</code> to verify the hashes are OK.</p>
<p>For large objects, calculating this hash can take some time so the addition of this hash can be disabled with <code>--s3-disable-checksum</code>. This will mean that these objects do not have an MD5 checksum.</p>
<p>Note that reading this from the object takes an additional <code>HEAD</code> request as the metadata isn't returned in object listings.</p>
<h3 id="reducing-costs">Reducing costs</h3>
<h4 id="avoiding-head-requests-to-read-the-modification-time">Avoiding HEAD requests to read the modification time</h4>
<p>By default, rclone will use the modification time of objects stored in S3 for syncing. This is stored in object metadata which unfortunately takes an extra HEAD request to read which can be expensive (in time and money).</p>
<p>The modification time is used by default for all operations that require checking the time a file was last updated. It allows rclone to treat the remote more like a true filesystem, but it is inefficient on S3 because it requires an extra API call to retrieve the metadata.</p>
<p>The extra API calls can be avoided when syncing (using <code>rclone sync</code> or <code>rclone copy</code>) in a few different ways, each with its own tradeoffs.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--size-only</code>
<ul>
<li>Only checks the size of files.</li>
<li>Uses no extra transactions.</li>
<li>If the file doesn't change size then rclone won't detect it has changed.</li>
<li><code>rclone sync --size-only /path/to/source s3:bucket</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>--checksum</code>
<ul>
<li>Checks the size and MD5 checksum of files.</li>
<li>Uses no extra transactions.</li>
<li>The most accurate detection of changes possible.</li>
<li>Will cause the source to read an MD5 checksum which, if it is a local disk, will cause lots of disk activity.</li>
<li>If the source and destination are both S3 this is the <strong>recommended</strong> flag to use for maximum efficiency.</li>
<li><code>rclone sync --checksum /path/to/source s3:bucket</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>--update --use-server-modtime</code>
<ul>
<li>Uses no extra transactions.</li>
<li>Modification time becomes the time the object was uploaded.</li>
<li>For many operations this is sufficient to determine if it needs uploading.</li>
<li>Using <code>--update</code> along with <code>--use-server-modtime</code>, avoids the extra API call and uploads files whose local modification time is newer than the time it was last uploaded.</li>
<li>Files created with timestamps in the past will be missed by the sync.</li>
<li><code>rclone sync --update --use-server-modtime /path/to/source s3:bucket</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>These flags can and should be used in combination with <code>--fast-list</code> - see below.</p>
<p>If using <code>rclone mount</code> or any command using the VFS (eg <code>rclone serve</code>) commands then you might want to consider using the VFS flag <code>--no-modtime</code> which will stop rclone reading the modification time for every object. You could also use <code>--use-server-modtime</code> if you are happy with the modification times of the objects being the time of upload.</p>
<h4 id="avoiding-get-requests-to-read-directory-listings">Avoiding GET requests to read directory listings</h4>
<p>Rclone's default directory traversal is to process each directory individually. This takes one API call per directory. Using the <code>--fast-list</code> flag will read all info about the objects into memory first using a smaller number of API calls (one per 1000 objects). See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list">rclone docs</a> for more details.</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --fast-list --checksum /path/to/source s3:bucket</code></pre>
<p><code>--fast-list</code> trades off API transactions for memory use. As a rough guide rclone uses 1k of memory per object stored, so using <code>--fast-list</code> on a sync of a million objects will use roughly 1 GiB of RAM.</p>
<p>If you are only copying a small number of files into a big repository then using <code>--no-traverse</code> is a good idea. This finds objects directly instead of through directory listings. You can do a "top-up" sync very cheaply by using <code>--max-age</code> and <code>--no-traverse</code> to copy only recent files, eg</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy --max-age 24h --no-traverse /path/to/source s3:bucket</code></pre>
<p>You'd then do a full <code>rclone sync</code> less often.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--fast-list</code> isn't required in the top-up sync.</p>
<h4 id="avoiding-head-requests-after-put">Avoiding HEAD requests after PUT</h4>
<p>By default, rclone will HEAD every object it uploads. It does this to check the object got uploaded correctly.</p>
<p>You can disable this with the <a href="#s3-no-head">--s3-no-head</a> option - see there for more details.</p>
<p>Setting this flag increases the chance for undetected upload failures.</p>
<h3 id="increasing-performance">Increasing performance</h3>
<h4 id="using-server-side-copy">Using server-side copy</h4>
<p>If you are copying objects between S3 buckets in the same region, you should use server-side copy. This is much faster than downloading and re-uploading the objects, as no data is transferred.</p>
<p>For rclone to use server-side copy, you must use the same remote for the source and destination.</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy s3:source-bucket s3:destination-bucket</code></pre>
<p>When using server-side copy, the performance is limited by the rate at which rclone issues API requests to S3. See below for how to increase the number of API requests rclone makes.</p>
<h4 id="increasing-the-rate-of-api-requests">Increasing the rate of API requests</h4>
<p>You can increase the rate of API requests to S3 by increasing the parallelism using <code>--transfers</code> and <code>--checkers</code> options.</p>
<p>Rclone uses a very conservative defaults for these settings, as not all providers support high rates of requests. Depending on your provider, you can increase significantly the number of transfers and checkers.</p>
<p>For example, with AWS S3, if you can increase the number of checkers to values like 200. If you are doing a server-side copy, you can also increase the number of transfers to 200.</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --transfers 200 --checkers 200 --checksum s3:source-bucket s3:destination-bucket</code></pre>
<p>You will need to experiment with these values to find the optimal settings for your setup.</p>
<h3 id="data-integrity">Data integrity</h3>
<p>Rclone does its best to verify every part of an upload or download to the s3 provider using various hashes.</p>
<p>Every HTTP transaction to/from the provider has a <code>X-Amz-Content-Sha256</code> or a <code>Content-Md5</code> header to guard against corruption of the HTTP body. The HTTP Header is protected by the signature passed in the <code>Authorization</code> header.</p>
<p>All communications with the provider is done over https for encryption and additional error protection.</p>
<h4 id="single-part-uploads">Single part uploads</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Rclone uploads single part uploads with a <code>Content-Md5</code> using the MD5 hash read from the source. The provider checks this is correct on receipt of the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Rclone then does a HEAD request (disable with <code>--s3-no-head</code>) to read the <code>ETag</code> back which is the MD5 of the file and checks that with what it sent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if the source does not have an MD5 then the single part uploads will not have hash protection. In this case it is recommended to use <code>--s3-upload-cutoff 0</code> so all files are uploaded as multipart uploads.</p>
<h4 id="multipart-uploads">Multipart uploads</h4>
<p>For files above <code>--s3-upload-cutoff</code> rclone splits the file into multiple parts for upload.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each part is protected with both an <code>X-Amz-Content-Sha256</code> and a <code>Content-Md5</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When rclone has finished the upload of all the parts it then completes the upload by sending:</p>
<ul>
<li>The MD5 hash of each part</li>
<li>The number of parts</li>
<li>This info is all protected with a <code>X-Amz-Content-Sha256</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The provider checks the MD5 for all the parts it has received against what rclone sends and if it is good it returns OK.</p>
<p>Rclone then does a HEAD request (disable with <code>--s3-no-head</code>) and checks the ETag is what it expects (in this case it should be the MD5 sum of all the MD5 sums of all the parts with the number of parts on the end).</p>
<p>If the source has an MD5 sum then rclone will attach the <code>X-Amz-Meta-Md5chksum</code> with it as the <code>ETag</code> for a multipart upload can't easily be checked against the file as the chunk size must be known in order to calculate it.</p>
<h4 id="downloads">Downloads</h4>
<p>Rclone checks the MD5 hash of the data downloaded against either the ETag or the <code>X-Amz-Meta-Md5chksum</code> metadata (if present) which rclone uploads with multipart uploads.</p>
<h4 id="further-checking">Further checking</h4>
<p>At each stage rclone and the provider are sending and checking hashes of <strong>everything</strong>. Rclone deliberately HEADs each object after upload to check it arrived safely for extra security. (You can disable this with <code>--s3-no-head</code>).</p>
<p>If you require further assurance that your data is intact you can use <code>rclone check</code> to check the hashes locally vs the remote.</p>
<p>And if you are feeling ultimately paranoid use <code>rclone check --download</code> which will download the files and check them against the local copies. (Note that this doesn't use disk to do this - it streams them in memory).</p>
<h3 id="versions">Versions</h3>
<p>When bucket versioning is enabled (this can be done with rclone with the <a href="#versioning"><code>rclone backend versioning</code></a> command) when rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html">new version of it</a> Likewise when you delete a file, the old version will be marked hidden and still be available.</p>
<p>Old versions of files, where available, are visible using the <a href="#s3-versions"><code>--s3-versions</code></a> flag.</p>
<p>It is also possible to view a bucket as it was at a certain point in time, using the <a href="#s3-version-at"><code>--s3-version-at</code></a> flag. This will show the file versions as they were at that time, showing files that have been deleted afterwards, and hiding files that were created since.</p>
<p>If you wish to remove all the old versions then you can use the <a href="#cleanup-hidden"><code>rclone backend cleanup-hidden remote:bucket</code></a> command which will delete all the old hidden versions of files, leaving the current ones intact. You can also supply a path and only old versions under that path will be deleted, e.g. <code>rclone backend cleanup-hidden remote:bucket/path/to/stuff</code>.</p>
<p>When you <code>purge</code> a bucket, the current and the old versions will be deleted then the bucket will be deleted.</p>
<p>However <code>delete</code> will cause the current versions of the files to become hidden old versions.</p>
<p>Here is a session showing the listing and retrieval of an old version followed by a <code>cleanup</code> of the old versions.</p>
<p>Show current version and all the versions with <code>--s3-versions</code> flag.</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone -q ls s3:cleanup-test

-rw-rw-r-- 1 ncw ncw 16 Jul  2 17:46 /tmp/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt</code></pre>
<p>Clean up all the old versions and show that they've gone.</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone -q backend cleanup-hidden s3:cleanup-test

$ rclone -q ls s3:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt

$ rclone -q --s3-versions ls s3:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt</code></pre>
<h4 id="versions-naming-caveat">Versions naming caveat</h4>
<p>When using <code>--s3-versions</code> flag rclone is relying on the file name to work out whether the objects are versions or not. Versions' names are created by inserting timestamp between file name and its extension.</p>
<pre><code>        9 file.txt
        8 file-v2023-07-17-161032-000.txt
       16 file-v2023-06-15-141003-000.txt</code></pre>
<p>If there are real files present with the same names as versions, then behaviour of <code>--s3-versions</code> can be unpredictable.</p>
<h3 id="cleanup-1">Cleanup</h3>
<p>If you run <code>rclone cleanup s3:bucket</code> then it will remove all pending multipart uploads older than 24 hours. You can use the <code>--interactive</code>/<code>i</code> or <code>--dry-run</code> flag to see exactly what it will do. If you want more control over the expiry date then run <code>rclone backend cleanup s3:bucket -o max-age=1h</code> to expire all uploads older than one hour. You can use <code>rclone backend list-multipart-uploads s3:bucket</code> to see the pending multipart uploads.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-filename-characters-1">Restricted filename characters</h3>
<p>S3 allows any valid UTF-8 string as a key.</p>
<p>Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8">replaced</a>, as they can't be used in XML.</p>
<p>The following characters are replaced since these are problematic when dealing with the REST API:</p>

<h3 id="multipart-uploads-1">Multipart uploads</h3>
<p>rclone supports multipart uploads with S3 which means that it can upload files bigger than 5 GiB.</p>
<p>Note that files uploaded <em>both</em> with multipart upload <em>and</em> through crypt remotes do not have MD5 sums.</p>
<p>rclone switches from single part uploads to multipart uploads at the point specified by <code>--s3-upload-cutoff</code>. This can be a maximum of 5 GiB and a minimum of 0 (ie always upload multipart files).</p>
<p>The chunk sizes used in the multipart upload are specified by <code>--s3-chunk-size</code> and the number of chunks uploaded concurrently is specified by <code>--s3-upload-concurrency</code>.</p>
<p>Multipart uploads will use <code>--transfers</code> * <code>--s3-upload-concurrency</code> * <code>--s3-chunk-size</code> extra memory. Single part uploads to not use extra memory.</p>
<p>Single part transfers can be faster than multipart transfers or slower depending on your latency from S3 - the more latency, the more likely single part transfers will be faster.</p>
<p>Increasing <code>--s3-upload-concurrency</code> will increase throughput (8 would be a sensible value) and increasing <code>--s3-chunk-size</code> also increases throughput (16M would be sensible). Increasing either of these will use more memory. The default values are high enough to gain most of the possible performance without using too much memory.</p>
<h3 id="buckets-and-regions">Buckets and Regions</h3>
<p>With Amazon S3 you can list buckets (<code>rclone lsd</code>) using any region, but you can only access the content of a bucket from the region it was created in. If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong region, you will get an error, <code>incorrect region, the bucket is not in 'XXX' region</code>.</p>
<h3 id="authentication-5">Authentication</h3>
<p>There are a number of ways to supply <code>rclone</code> with a set of AWS credentials, with and without using the environment.</p>
<p>The different authentication methods are tried in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly in the rclone configuration file (<code>env_auth = false</code> in the config file):
<ul>
<li><code>access_key_id</code> and <code>secret_access_key</code> are required.</li>
<li><code>session_token</code> can be optionally set when using AWS STS.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Runtime configuration (<code>env_auth = true</code> in the config file):
<ul>
<li>Export the following environment variables before running <code>rclone</code>:
<ul>
<li>Access Key ID: <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> or <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY</code></li>
<li>Secret Access Key: <code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code> or <code>AWS_SECRET_KEY</code></li>
<li>Session Token: <code>AWS_SESSION_TOKEN</code> (optional)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Or, use a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html">named profile</a>:
<ul>
<li>Profile files are standard files used by AWS CLI tools</li>
<li>By default it will use the profile in your home directory (e.g. <code>~/.aws/credentials</code> on unix based systems) file and the "default" profile, to change set these environment variables or config keys:
<ul>
<li><code>AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE</code> to control which file or the <code>shared_credentials_file</code> config key.</li>
<li><code>AWS_PROFILE</code> to control which profile to use or the <code>profile</code> config key.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Or, run <code>rclone</code> in an ECS task with an IAM role (AWS only).</li>
<li>Or, run <code>rclone</code> on an EC2 instance with an IAM role (AWS only).</li>
<li>Or, run <code>rclone</code> in an EKS pod with an IAM role that is associated with a service account (AWS only).</li>
<li>Or, use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-process-credentials.html">process credentials</a> to read config from an external program.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>env_auth = true</code> rclone (which uses the SDK for Go v2) should support <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/standardized-credentials.html">all authentication methods</a> that the <code>aws</code> CLI tool does and the other AWS SDKs.</p>
<p>If none of these option actually end up providing <code>rclone</code> with AWS credentials then S3 interaction will be non-authenticated (see the <a href="#anonymous-access">anonymous access</a> section for more info).</p>
<h3 id="s3-permissions">S3 Permissions</h3>
<p>When using the <code>sync</code> subcommand of <code>rclone</code> the following minimum permissions are required to be available on the bucket being written to:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ListBucket</code></li>
<li><code>DeleteObject</code></li>
<li><code>GetObject</code></li>
<li><code>PutObject</code></li>
<li><code>PutObjectACL</code></li>
<li><code>CreateBucket</code> (unless using <a href="#s3-no-check-bucket">s3-no-check-bucket</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>When using the <code>lsd</code> subcommand, the <code>ListAllMyBuckets</code> permission is required.</p>
<p>Example policy:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;,

<p>In this case you need to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/restore-archived-objects.html">restore</a> the object(s) in question before accessing object contents. The <a href="#restore">restore</a> section below shows how to do this with rclone.</p>
<p>Note that rclone only speaks the S3 API it does not speak the Glacier Vault API, so rclone cannot directly access Glacier Vaults.</p>
<h3 id="object-lock-enabled-s3-bucket">Object-lock enabled S3 bucket</h3>
<p>According to AWS's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-overview.html#object-lock-permission">documentation on S3 Object Lock</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you configure a default retention period on a bucket, requests to upload objects in such a bucket must include the Content-MD5 header.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="#modification-times-and-hashes">Modification times and hashes</a> section, small files that are not uploaded as multipart, use a different tag, causing the upload to fail. A simple solution is to set the <code>--s3-upload-cutoff 0</code> and force all the files to be uploaded as multipart.</p>

<h4 id="s3-upload-cutoff">--s3-upload-cutoff</h4>
<p>Cutoff for switching to chunked upload.</p>
<p>Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of chunk_size. The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: upload_cutoff</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_UPLOAD_CUTOFF</li>
<li>Type: SizeSuffix</li>
<li>Default: 200Mi</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-chunk-size">--s3-chunk-size</h4>
<p>Chunk size to use for uploading.</p>
<p>When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff or files with unknown size (e.g. from "rclone rcat" or uploaded with "rclone mount" or google photos or google docs) they will be uploaded as multipart uploads using this chunk size.</p>
<p>Note that "--s3-upload-concurrency" chunks of this size are buffered in memory per transfer.</p>
<p>If you are transferring large files over high-speed links and you have enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.</p>
<p>Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a large file of known size to stay below the 10,000 chunks limit.</p>
<p>Files of unknown size are uploaded with the configured chunk_size. Since the default chunk size is 5 MiB and there can be at most 10,000 chunks, this means that by default the maximum size of a file you can stream upload is 48 GiB. If you wish to stream upload larger files then you will need to increase chunk_size.</p>
<p>Increasing the chunk size decreases the accuracy of the progress statistics displayed with "-P" flag. Rclone treats chunk as sent when it's buffered by the AWS SDK, when in fact it may still be uploading. A bigger chunk size means a bigger AWS SDK buffer and progress reporting more deviating from the truth.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: chunk_size</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_CHUNK_SIZE</li>
<li>Type: SizeSuffix</li>
<li>Default: 5Mi</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-max-upload-parts">--s3-max-upload-parts</h4>
<p>Maximum number of parts in a multipart upload.</p>
<p>This option defines the maximum number of multipart chunks to use when doing a multipart upload.</p>
<p>This can be useful if a service does not support the AWS S3 specification of 10,000 chunks.</p>
<p>Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a large file of a known size to stay below this number of chunks limit.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: max_upload_parts</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_MAX_UPLOAD_PARTS</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 10000</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-copy-cutoff">--s3-copy-cutoff</h4>
<p>Cutoff for switching to multipart copy.</p>
<p>Any files larger than this that need to be server-side copied will be copied in chunks of this size.</p>
<p>The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>

<li>Default: 4.656Gi</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-disable-checksum">--s3-disable-checksum</h4>
<p>Don't store MD5 checksum with object metadata.</p>
<p>Normally rclone will calculate the MD5 checksum of the input before uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files to start uploading.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: disable_checksum</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_DISABLE_CHECKSUM</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-shared-credentials-file">--s3-shared-credentials-file</h4>
<p>Path to the shared credentials file.</p>
<p>If env_auth = true then rclone can use a shared credentials file.</p>
<p>If this variable is empty rclone will look for the "AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE" env variable. If the env value is empty it will default to the current user's home directory.</p>
<pre><code>Linux/OSX: &quot;$HOME/.aws/credentials&quot;
Windows:   &quot;%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Properties:</p>

<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-profile">--s3-profile</h4>
<p>Profile to use in the shared credentials file.</p>
<p>If env_auth = true then rclone can use a shared credentials file. This variable controls which profile is used in that file.</p>
<p>If empty it will default to the environment variable "AWS_PROFILE" or "default" if that environment variable is also not set.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: profile</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_PROFILE</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>

<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-upload-concurrency">--s3-upload-concurrency</h4>
<p>Concurrency for multipart uploads and copies.</p>
<p>This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded concurrently for multipart uploads and copies.</p>
<p>If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing this may help to speed up the transfers.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: upload_concurrency</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 4</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-force-path-style">--s3-force-path-style</h4>
<p>If true use path style access if false use virtual hosted style.</p>
<p>If this is true (the default) then rclone will use path style access, if false then rclone will use virtual path style. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro">the AWS S3 docs</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Some providers (e.g. AWS, Aliyun OSS, Netease COS, or Tencent COS) require this set to false - rclone will do this automatically based on the provider setting.</p>
<p>Note that if your bucket isn't a valid DNS name, i.e. has '.' or '_' in, you'll need to set this to true.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: force_path_style</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: true</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-v2-auth">--s3-v2-auth</h4>
<p>If true use v2 authentication.</p>
<p>If this is false (the default) then rclone will use v4 authentication. If it is set then rclone will use v2 authentication.</p>
<p>Use this only if v4 signatures don't work, e.g. pre Jewel/v10 CEPH.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: v2_auth</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_V2_AUTH</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>

<h4 id="s3-leave-parts-on-error">--s3-leave-parts-on-error</h4>
<p>If true avoid calling abort upload on a failure, leaving all successfully uploaded parts on S3 for manual recovery.</p>
<p>It should be set to true for resuming uploads across different sessions.</p>
<p>WARNING: Storing parts of an incomplete multipart upload counts towards space usage on S3 and will add additional costs if not cleaned up.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: leave_parts_on_error</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_LEAVE_PARTS_ON_ERROR</li>
<li>Provider: AWS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-list-chunk">--s3-list-chunk</h4>
<p>Size of listing chunk (response list for each ListObject S3 request).</p>
<p>This option is also known as "MaxKeys", "max-items", or "page-size" from the AWS S3 specification. Most services truncate the response list to 1000 objects even if requested more than that. In AWS S3 this is a global maximum and cannot be changed, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/ls.html">AWS S3</a>. In Ceph, this can be increased with the "rgw list buckets max chunk" option.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: list_chunk</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_LIST_CHUNK</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 1000</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-list-version">--s3-list-version</h4>
<p>Version of ListObjects to use: 1,2 or 0 for auto.</p>
<p>When S3 originally launched it only provided the ListObjects call to enumerate objects in a bucket.</p>
<p>However in May 2016 the ListObjectsV2 call was introduced. This is much higher performance and should be used if at all possible.</p>
<p>If set to the default, 0, rclone will guess according to the provider set which list objects method to call. If it guesses wrong, then it may be set manually here.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: list_version</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_LIST_VERSION</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 0</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-list-url-encode">--s3-list-url-encode</h4>
<p>Whether to url encode listings: true/false/unset</p>
<p>Some providers support URL encoding listings and where this is available this is more reliable when using control characters in file names. If this is set to unset (the default) then rclone will choose according to the provider setting what to apply, but you can override rclone's choice here.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: list_url_encode</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_LIST_URL_ENCODE</li>
<li>Type: Tristate</li>
<li>Default: unset</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-no-check-bucket">--s3-no-check-bucket</h4>
<p>If set, don't attempt to check the bucket exists or create it.</p>
<p>This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions rclone does if you know the bucket exists already.</p>
<p>It can also be needed if the user you are using does not have bucket creation permissions. Before v1.52.0 this would have passed silently due to a bug.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: no_check_bucket</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_NO_CHECK_BUCKET</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-no-head">--s3-no-head</h4>
<p>If set, don't HEAD uploaded objects to check integrity.</p>
<p>This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions rclone does.</p>
<p>Setting it means that if rclone receives a 200 OK message after uploading an object with PUT then it will assume that it got uploaded properly.</p>
<p>In particular it will assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>the metadata, including modtime, storage class and content type was as uploaded</li>
<li>the size was as uploaded</li>
</ul>
<p>It reads the following items from the response for a single part PUT:</p>
<ul>
<li>the MD5SUM</li>
<li>The uploaded date</li>
</ul>
<p>For multipart uploads these items aren't read.</p>
<p>If an source object of unknown length is uploaded then rclone <strong>will</strong> do a HEAD request.</p>
<p>Setting this flag increases the chance for undetected upload failures, in particular an incorrect size, so it isn't recommended for normal operation. In practice the chance of an undetected upload failure is very small even with this flag.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: no_head</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_NO_HEAD</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-no-head-object">--s3-no-head-object</h4>

</ul>
<h4 id="s3-disable-http2">--s3-disable-http2</h4>
<p>Disable usage of http2 for S3 backends.</p>
<p>There is currently an unsolved issue with the s3 (specifically minio) backend and HTTP/2. HTTP/2 is enabled by default for the s3 backend but can be disabled here. When the issue is solved this flag will be removed.</p>
<p>See: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4673, https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3631</p>

<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-download-url">--s3-download-url</h4>
<p>Custom endpoint for downloads. This is usually set to a CloudFront CDN URL as AWS S3 offers cheaper egress for data downloaded through the CloudFront network.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: download_url</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_DOWNLOAD_URL</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-directory-markers">--s3-directory-markers</h4>
<p>Upload an empty object with a trailing slash when a new directory is created</p>
<p>Empty folders are unsupported for bucket based remotes, this option creates an empty object ending with "/", to persist the folder.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: directory_markers</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_DIRECTORY_MARKERS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="s3-use-multipart-etag">--s3-use-multipart-etag</h4>
<p>Whether to use ETag in multipart uploads for verification</p>
<p>This should be true, false or left unset to use the default for the provider.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: use_multipart_etag</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_USE_MULTIPART_ETAG</li>
<li>Type: Tristate</li>
<li>Default: unset</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-use-unsigned-payload">--s3-use-unsigned-payload</h4>
<p>Whether to use an unsigned payload in PutObject</p>
<p>Rclone has to avoid the AWS SDK seeking the body when calling PutObject. The AWS provider can add checksums in the trailer to avoid seeking but other providers can't.</p>
<p>This should be true, false or left unset to use the default for the provider.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: use_unsigned_payload</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_USE_UNSIGNED_PAYLOAD</li>
<li>Type: Tristate</li>
<li>Default: unset</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-use-presigned-request">--s3-use-presigned-request</h4>
<p>Whether to use a presigned request or PutObject for single part uploads</p>
<p>If this is false rclone will use PutObject from the AWS SDK to upload an object.</p>
<p>Versions of rclone &lt; 1.59 use presigned requests to upload a single part object and setting this flag to true will re-enable that functionality. This shouldn't be necessary except in exceptional circumstances or for testing.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: use_presigned_request</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_USE_PRESIGNED_REQUEST</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>

<h4 id="s3-versions">--s3-versions</h4>
<p>Include old versions in directory listings.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: versions</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_VERSIONS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-version-at">--s3-version-at</h4>
<p>Show file versions as they were at the specified time.</p>
<p>The parameter should be a date, "2006-01-02", datetime "2006-01-02 15:04:05" or a duration for that long ago, eg "100d" or "1h".</p>
<p>Note that when using this no file write operations are permitted, so you can't upload files or delete them.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#time-option">the time option docs</a> for valid formats.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: version_at</li>

<li>Type: Time</li>
<li>Default: off</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-version-deleted">--s3-version-deleted</h4>
<p>Show deleted file markers when using versions.</p>
<p>This shows deleted file markers in the listing when using versions. These will appear as 0 size files. The only operation which can be performed on them is deletion.</p>
<p>Deleting a delete marker will reveal the previous version.</p>
<p>Deleted files will always show with a timestamp.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: version_deleted</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_VERSION_DELETED</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-decompress">--s3-decompress</h4>
<p>If set this will decompress gzip encoded objects.</p>
<p>It is possible to upload objects to S3 with "Content-Encoding: gzip" set. Normally rclone will download these files as compressed objects.</p>
<p>If this flag is set then rclone will decompress these files with "Content-Encoding: gzip" as they are received. This means that rclone can't check the size and hash but the file contents will be decompressed.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: decompress</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_DECOMPRESS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-might-gzip">--s3-might-gzip</h4>
<p>Set this if the backend might gzip objects.</p>
<p>Normally providers will not alter objects when they are downloaded. If an object was not uploaded with <code>Content-Encoding: gzip</code> then it won't be set on download.</p>
<p>However some providers may gzip objects even if they weren't uploaded with <code>Content-Encoding: gzip</code> (eg Cloudflare).</p>
<p>A symptom of this would be receiving errors like</p>
<pre><code>ERROR corrupted on transfer: sizes differ NNN vs MMM</code></pre>
<p>If you set this flag and rclone downloads an object with Content-Encoding: gzip set and chunked transfer encoding, then rclone will decompress the object on the fly.</p>
<p>If this is set to unset (the default) then rclone will choose according to the provider setting what to apply, but you can override rclone's choice here.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: might_gzip</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_S3_MIGHT_GZIP</li>
<li>Type: Tristate</li>
<li>Default: unset</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s3-use-accept-encoding-gzip">--s3-use-accept-encoding-gzip</h4>
<p>Whether to send <code>Accept-Encoding: gzip</code> header.</p>
<p>By default, rclone will append <code>Accept-Encoding: gzip</code> to the request to download compressed objects whenever possible.</p>
<p>However some providers such as Google Cloud Storage may alter the HTTP headers, breaking the signature of the request.</p>
<p>A symptom of this would be receiving errors like</p>
<pre><code>SignatureDoesNotMatch: The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided.</code></pre>
<p>In this case, you might want to try disabling this option.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>

<h4 id="s3-use-already-exists">--s3-use-already-exists</h4>
<p>Set if rclone should report BucketAlreadyExists errors on bucket creation.</p>
<p>At some point during the evolution of the s3 protocol, AWS started returning an <code>AlreadyOwnedByYou</code> error when attempting to create a bucket that the user already owned, rather than a <code>BucketAlreadyExists</code> error.</p>
<p>Unfortunately exactly what has been implemented by s3 clones is a little inconsistent, some return <code>AlreadyOwnedByYou</code>, some return <code>BucketAlreadyExists</code> and some return no error at all.</p>
<p>This is important to rclone because it ensures the bucket exists by creating it on quite a lot of operations (unless <code>--s3-no-check-bucket</code> is used).</p>
<p>If rclone knows the provider can return <code>AlreadyOwnedByYou</code> or returns no error then it can report <code>BucketAlreadyExists</code> errors when the user attempts to create a bucket not owned by them. Otherwise rclone ignores the <code>BucketAlreadyExists</code> error which can lead to confusion.</p>
<p>This should be automatically set correctly for all providers rclone knows about - please make a bug report if not.</p>

<h4 id="s3-directory-bucket">--s3-directory-bucket</h4>
<p>Set to use AWS Directory Buckets</p>
<p>If you are using an AWS Directory Bucket then set this flag.</p>
<p>This will ensure no <code>Content-Md5</code> headers are sent and ensure <code>ETag</code> headers are not interpreted as MD5 sums. <code>X-Amz-Meta-Md5chksum</code> will be set on all objects whether single or multipart uploaded.</p>
<p>This also sets <code>no_check_bucket = true</code>.</p>
<p>Note that Directory Buckets do not support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Versioning</li>
<li><code>Content-Encoding: gzip</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Rclone limitations with Directory Buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li>rclone does not support creating Directory Buckets with <code>rclone mkdir</code></li>
<li>... or removing them with <code>rclone rmdir</code> yet</li>
<li>Directory Buckets do not appear when doing <code>rclone lsf</code> at the top level.</li>
<li>Rclone can't remove auto created directories yet. In theory this should work with <code>directory_markers = true</code> but it doesn't.</li>

<p>This command lists the unfinished multipart uploads in JSON format.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend list-multipart s3:bucket/path/to/object</code></pre>
<p>It returns a dictionary of buckets with values as lists of unfinished multipart uploads.</p>
<p>You can call it with no bucket in which case it lists all bucket, with a bucket or with a bucket and path.</p>
<pre><code>{

<h3 id="cleanup-2">cleanup</h3>
<p>Remove unfinished multipart uploads.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend cleanup remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This command removes unfinished multipart uploads of age greater than max-age which defaults to 24 hours.</p>
<p>Note that you can use --interactive/-i or --dry-run with this command to see what it would do.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend cleanup s3:bucket/path/to/object
rclone backend cleanup -o max-age=7w s3:bucket/path/to/object</code></pre>
<p>Durations are parsed as per the rest of rclone, 2h, 7d, 7w etc.</p>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>"max-age": Max age of upload to delete</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cleanup-hidden">cleanup-hidden</h3>
<p>Remove old versions of files.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend cleanup-hidden remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This command removes any old hidden versions of files on a versions enabled bucket.</p>
<p>Note that you can use --interactive/-i or --dry-run with this command to see what it would do.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend cleanup-hidden s3:bucket/path/to/dir</code></pre>
<h3 id="versioning">versioning</h3>
<p>Set/get versioning support for a bucket.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend versioning remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This command sets versioning support if a parameter is passed and then returns the current versioning status for the bucket supplied.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend versioning s3:bucket # read status only
rclone backend versioning s3:bucket Enabled
rclone backend versioning s3:bucket Suspended</code></pre>
<p>It may return "Enabled", "Suspended" or "Unversioned". Note that once versioning has been enabled the status can't be set back to "Unversioned".</p>
<h3 id="set">set</h3>
<p>Set command for updating the config parameters.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend set remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This set command can be used to update the config parameters for a running s3 backend.</p>
<p>Usage Examples:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend set s3: [-o opt_name=opt_value] [-o opt_name2=opt_value2]
rclone rc backend/command command=set fs=s3: [-o opt_name=opt_value] [-o opt_name2=opt_value2]
rclone rc backend/command command=set fs=s3: -o session_token=X -o access_key_id=X -o secret_access_key=X</code></pre>
<p>The option keys are named as they are in the config file.</p>
<p>This rebuilds the connection to the s3 backend when it is called with the new parameters. Only new parameters need be passed as the values will default to those currently in use.</p>
<p>It doesn't return anything.</p>
<h3 id="anonymous-access">Anonymous access to public buckets</h3>
<p>If you want to use rclone to access a public bucket, configure with a blank <code>access_key_id</code> and <code>secret_access_key</code>. Your config should end up looking like this:</p>
<pre><code>[anons3]
type = s3
provider = AWS</code></pre>
<p>Then use it as normal with the name of the public bucket, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd anons3:1000genomes</code></pre>
<p>You will be able to list and copy data but not upload it.</p>
<p>You can also do this entirely on the command line</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd :s3,provider=AWS:1000genomes</code></pre>
<h2 id="providers-1">Providers</h2>
<h3 id="aws-s3">AWS S3</h3>
<p>This is the provider used as main example and described in the <a href="#configuration">configuration</a> section above.</p>
<h3 id="aws-directory-buckets">AWS Directory Buckets</h3>
<p>From rclone v1.69 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-overview.html">Directory Buckets</a> are supported.</p>
<p>You will need to set the <code>directory_buckets = true</code> config parameter or use <code>--s3-directory-buckets</code>.</p>
<p>Note that rclone cannot yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create directory buckets</li>
<li>List directory buckets</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="#s3-directory-buckets">the --s3-directory-buckets flag</a> for more info</p>
<h3 id="aws-snowball-edge">AWS Snowball Edge</h3>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/">AWS Snowball</a> is a hardware appliance used for transferring bulk data back to AWS. Its main software interface is S3 object storage.</p>
<p>To use rclone with AWS Snowball Edge devices, configure as standard for an 'S3 Compatible Service'.</p>
<p>If using rclone pre v1.59 be sure to set <code>upload_cutoff = 0</code> otherwise you will run into authentication header issues as the snowball device does not support query parameter based authentication.</p>
<p>With rclone v1.59 or later setting <code>upload_cutoff</code> should not be necessary.</p>
<p>eg.</p>
<pre><code>[snowball]
type = s3
provider = Other
access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
endpoint = http://[IP of Snowball]:8080
upload_cutoff = 0</code></pre>
<h3 id="ceph">Ceph</h3>
<p><a href="https://ceph.com/">Ceph</a> is an open-source, unified, distributed storage system designed for excellent performance, reliability and scalability. It has an S3 compatible object storage interface.</p>
<p>To use rclone with Ceph, configure as above but leave the region blank and set the endpoint. You should end up with something like this in your config:</p>
<pre><code>[ceph]
type = s3
provider = Ceph
env_auth = false
access_key_id = XXX
secret_access_key = YYY
region =
endpoint = https://ceph.endpoint.example.com
location_constraint =
acl =
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =</code></pre>
<p>If you are using an older version of CEPH (e.g. 10.2.x Jewel) and a version of rclone before v1.59 then you may need to supply the parameter <code>--s3-upload-cutoff 0</code> or put this in the config file as <code>upload_cutoff 0</code> to work around a bug which causes uploading of small files to fail.</p>
<p>Note also that Ceph sometimes puts <code>/</code> in the passwords it gives users. If you read the secret access key using the command line tools you will get a JSON blob with the <code>/</code> escaped as <code>\/</code>. Make sure you only write <code>/</code> in the secret access key.</p>
<p>Eg the dump from Ceph looks something like this (irrelevant keys removed).</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;user_id&quot;: &quot;xxx&quot;,
    &quot;display_name&quot;: &quot;xxxx&quot;,
    &quot;keys&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;user&quot;: &quot;xxx&quot;,
            &quot;access_key&quot;: &quot;xxxxxx&quot;,
            &quot;secret_key&quot;: &quot;xxxxxx\/xxxx&quot;
        }
    ],
}</code></pre>
<p>Because this is a json dump, it is encoding the <code>/</code> as <code>\/</code>, so if you use the secret key as <code>xxxxxx/xxxx</code> it will work fine.</p>
<h3 id="cloudflare-r2">Cloudflare R2</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/r2-open-beta/">Cloudflare R2</a> Storage allows developers to store large amounts of unstructured data without the costly egress bandwidth fees associated with typical cloud storage services.</p>

<p>Now run <code>rclone lsf r2:</code> to see your buckets and <code>rclone lsf r2:bucket</code> to look within a bucket.</p>
<p>For R2 tokens with the "Object Read &amp; Write" permission, you may also need to add <code>no_check_bucket = true</code> for object uploads to work correctly.</p>
<p>Note that Cloudflare decompresses files uploaded with <code>Content-Encoding: gzip</code> by default which is a deviation from what AWS does. If this is causing a problem then upload the files with <code>--header-upload "Cache-Control: no-transform"</code></p>
<p>A consequence of this is that <code>Content-Encoding: gzip</code> will never appear in the metadata on Cloudflare.</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs">GoogleCloudStorage</a> is an <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/interoperability">S3-interoperable</a> object storage service from Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p>To connect to Google Cloud Storage you will need an access key and secret key. These can be retrieved by creating an <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/managing-hmackeys">HMAC key</a>.</p>
<pre><code>[gs]

<p><strong>Note</strong> that <code>--s3-versions</code> does not work with GCS when it needs to do directory paging. Rclone will return the error:</p>
<pre><code>s3 protocol error: received versions listing with IsTruncated set with no NextKeyMarker</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/object-storage/">Spaces</a> is an <a href="https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/spaces/">S3-interoperable</a> object storage service from cloud provider DigitalOcean.</p>
<p>To connect to DigitalOcean Spaces you will need an access key and secret key. These can be retrieved on the "<a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/api/tokens">Applications &amp; API</a>" page of the DigitalOcean control panel. They will be needed when prompted by <code>rclone config</code> for your <code>access_key_id</code> and <code>secret_access_key</code>.</p>
<p>When prompted for a <code>region</code> or <code>location_constraint</code>, press enter to use the default value. The region must be included in the <code>endpoint</code> setting (e.g. <code>nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com</code>). The default values can be used for other settings.</p>
<p>Going through the whole process of creating a new remote by running <code>rclone config</code>, each prompt should be answered as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>Storage&gt; s3
env_auth&gt; 1
access_key_id&gt; YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key&gt; YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region&gt;
endpoint&gt; nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
location_constraint&gt;
acl&gt;

<p>The resulting configuration file should look like:</p>
<pre><code>[spaces]

<p>Once configured, you can create a new Space and begin copying files. For example:</p>
<pre><code>rclone mkdir spaces:my-new-space

<h3 id="RackCorp">RackCorp</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.rackcorp.com/storage/s3storage">RackCorp Object Storage</a> is an S3 compatible object storage platform from your friendly cloud provider RackCorp. The service is fast, reliable, well priced and located in many strategic locations unserviced by others, to ensure you can maintain data sovereignty.</p>
<p>Before you can use RackCorp Object Storage, you'll need to "<a href="https://www.rackcorp.com/signup">sign up</a>" for an account on our "<a href="https://portal.rackcorp.com">portal</a>". Next you can create an <code>access key</code>, a <code>secret key</code> and <code>buckets</code>, in your location of choice with ease. These details are required for the next steps of configuration, when <code>rclone config</code> asks for your <code>access_key_id</code> and <code>secret_access_key</code>.</p>
<p>Your config should end up looking a bit like this:</p>
<pre><code>[RCS3-demo-config]
type = s3
provider = RackCorp
env_auth = true
access_key_id = YOURACCESSKEY
secret_access_key = YOURSECRETACCESSKEY
region = au-nsw
endpoint = s3.rackcorp.com
location_constraint = au-nsw</code></pre>
<h3 id="rclone">Rclone Serve S3</h3>
<p>Rclone can serve any remote over the S3 protocol. For details see the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_s3/">rclone serve s3</a> documentation.</p>
<p>For example, to serve <code>remote:path</code> over s3, run the server like this:</p>
<pre><code>rclone serve s3 --auth-key ACCESS_KEY_ID,SECRET_ACCESS_KEY remote:path</code></pre>
<p>This will be compatible with an rclone remote which is defined like this:</p>
<pre><code>[serves3]
type = s3
provider = Rclone
endpoint = http://127.0.0.1:8080/
access_key_id = ACCESS_KEY_ID
secret_access_key = SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
use_multipart_uploads = false</code></pre>
<p>Note that setting <code>use_multipart_uploads = false</code> is to work around <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_s3/#bugs">a bug</a> which will be fixed in due course.</p>
<h3 id="scaleway">Scaleway</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.scaleway.com/object-storage/">Scaleway</a> The Object Storage platform allows you to store anything from backups, logs and web assets to documents and photos. Files can be dropped from the Scaleway console or transferred through our API and CLI or using any S3-compatible tool.</p>
<p>Scaleway provides an S3 interface which can be configured for use with rclone like this:</p>
<pre><code>[scaleway]
type = s3
provider = Scaleway
env_auth = false
endpoint = s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
access_key_id = SCWXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
secret_access_key = 1111111-2222-3333-44444-55555555555555

copy_cutoff = 5M</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/glacier-cold-storage/">Scaleway Glacier</a> is the low-cost S3 Glacier alternative from Scaleway and it works the same way as on S3 by accepting the "GLACIER" <code>storage_class</code>. So you can configure your remote with the <code>storage_class = GLACIER</code> option to upload directly to Scaleway Glacier. Don't forget that in this state you can't read files back after, you will need to restore them to "STANDARD" storage_class first before being able to read them (see "restore" section above)</p>

<h4 id="backend-quirks">Backend quirks</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>--chunk-size</code> is forced to be 64 MiB or greater. This will use more memory than the default of 5 MiB.</li>
<li>Server side copy is disabled as it isn't currently supported in the gateway.</li>
<li>GetTier and SetTier are not supported.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="backend-bugs">Backend bugs</h4>
<p>Due to <a href="https://github.com/storj/gateway-mt/issues/39">issue #39</a> uploading multipart files via the S3 gateway causes them to lose their metadata. For rclone's purpose this means that the modification time is not stored, nor is any MD5SUM (if one is available from the source).</p>
<p>This has the following consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <code>rclone rcat</code> will fail as the metadata doesn't match after upload</li>
<li>Uploading files with <code>rclone mount</code> will fail for the same reason
<ul>
<li>This can worked around by using <code>--vfs-cache-mode writes</code> or <code>--vfs-cache-mode full</code> or setting <code>--s3-upload-cutoff</code> large</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Files uploaded via a multipart upload won't have their modtimes
<ul>
<li>This will mean that <code>rclone sync</code> will likely keep trying to upload files bigger than <code>--s3-upload-cutoff</code></li>
<li>This can be worked around with <code>--checksum</code> or <code>--size-only</code> or setting <code>--s3-upload-cutoff</code> large</li>
<li>The maximum value for <code>--s3-upload-cutoff</code> is 5GiB though</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>One general purpose workaround is to set <code>--s3-upload-cutoff 5G</code>. This means that rclone will upload files smaller than 5GiB as single parts. Note that this can be set in the config file with <code>upload_cutoff = 5G</code> or configured in the advanced settings. If you regularly transfer files larger than 5G then using <code>--checksum</code> or <code>--size-only</code> in <code>rclone sync</code> is the recommended workaround.</p>
<h4 id="comparison-with-the-native-protocol">Comparison with the native protocol</h4>
<p>Use the <a href="/storj">the native protocol</a> to take advantage of client-side encryption as well as to achieve the best possible download performance. Uploads will be erasure-coded locally, thus a 1gb upload will result in 2.68gb of data being uploaded to storage nodes across the network.</p>
<p>Use this backend and the S3 compatible Hosted Gateway to increase upload performance and reduce the load on your systems and network. Uploads will be encrypted and erasure-coded server-side, thus a 1GB upload will result in only in 1GB of data being uploaded to storage nodes across the network.</p>
<p>For more detailed comparison please check the documentation of the <a href="/storj">storj</a> backend.</p>
<h2 id="memory-usage-memory">Memory usage {memory}</h2>
<p>The most common cause of rclone using lots of memory is a single directory with millions of files in. Despite s3 not really having the concepts of directories, rclone does the sync on a directory by directory basis to be compatible with normal filing systems.</p>
<p>Rclone loads each directory into memory as rclone objects. Each rclone object takes 0.5k-1k of memory, so approximately 1GB per 1,000,000 files, and the sync for that directory does not begin until it is entirely loaded in memory. So the sync can take a long time to start for large directories.</p>
<p>To sync a directory with 100,000,000 files in you would need approximately 100 GB of memory. At some point the amount of memory becomes difficult to provide so there is <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/wiki/Big-syncs-with-millions-of-files">a workaround for this</a> which involves a bit of scripting.</p>
<p>At some point rclone will gain a sync mode which is effectively this workaround but built in to rclone.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-6">Limitations</h2>
<p><code>rclone about</code> is not supported by the S3 backend. Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy <code>mfs</code> (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">List of backends that do not support rclone about</a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/">rclone about</a></p>

<h3 id="application-keys">Application Keys</h3>
<p>B2 supports multiple <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-application-keys">Application Keys for different access permission to B2 Buckets</a>.</p>
<p>You can use these with rclone too; you will need to use rclone version 1.43 or later.</p>
<p>Follow Backblaze's docs to create an Application Key with the required permission and add the <code>applicationKeyId</code> as the <code>account</code> and the <code>Application Key</code> itself as the <code>key</code>.</p>
<p>Note that you must put the <em>applicationKeyId</em> as the <code>account</code> – you can't use the master Account ID. If you try then B2 will return 401 errors.</p>
<h3 id="fast-list-1">--fast-list</h3>
<p>This remote supports <code>--fast-list</code> which allows you to use fewer transactions in exchange for more memory. See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list">rclone docs</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-2">Modification times</h3>
<p>The modification time is stored as metadata on the object as <code>X-Bz-Info-src_last_modified_millis</code> as milliseconds since 1970-01-01 in the Backblaze standard. Other tools should be able to use this as a modified time.</p>
<p>Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported. Note that if a modification time needs to be updated on an object then it will create a new version of the object.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-filename-characters-2">Restricted filename characters</h3>
<p>In addition to the <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters">default restricted characters set</a> the following characters are also replaced:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Character</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Value</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Replacement</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>\</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">0x5C</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">＼</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8">replaced</a>, as they can't be used in JSON strings.</p>
<p>Note that in 2020-05 Backblaze started allowing  characters in file names. Rclone hasn't changed its encoding as this could cause syncs to re-transfer files. If you want rclone not to replace  then see the <code>--b2-encoding</code> flag below and remove the <code>BackSlash</code> from the string. This can be set in the config.</p>
<h3 id="sha1-checksums">SHA1 checksums</h3>
<p>The SHA1 checksums of the files are checked on upload and download and will be used in the syncing process.</p>
<p>Large files (bigger than the limit in <code>--b2-upload-cutoff</code>) which are uploaded in chunks will store their SHA1 on the object as <code>X-Bz-Info-large_file_sha1</code> as recommended by Backblaze.</p>
<p>For a large file to be uploaded with an SHA1 checksum, the source needs to support SHA1 checksums. The local disk supports SHA1 checksums so large file transfers from local disk will have an SHA1. See <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#features">the overview</a> for exactly which remotes support SHA1.</p>
<p>Sources which don't support SHA1, in particular <code>crypt</code> will upload large files without SHA1 checksums. This may be fixed in the future (see <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1767">#1767</a>).</p>
<p>Files sizes below <code>--b2-upload-cutoff</code> will always have an SHA1 regardless of the source.</p>
<h3 id="transfers">Transfers</h3>
<p>Backblaze recommends that you do lots of transfers simultaneously for maximum speed. In tests from my SSD equipped laptop the optimum setting is about <code>--transfers 32</code> though higher numbers may be used for a slight speed improvement. The optimum number for you may vary depending on your hardware, how big the files are, how much you want to load your computer, etc. The default of <code>--transfers 4</code> is definitely too low for Backblaze B2 though.</p>
<p>Note that uploading big files (bigger than 200 MiB by default) will use a 96 MiB RAM buffer by default. There can be at most <code>--transfers</code> of these in use at any moment, so this sets the upper limit on the memory used.</p>
<h3 id="versions-1">Versions</h3>
<p>The default setting of B2 is to keep old versions of files. This means when rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-file-versions">new version of it</a>. Likewise when you delete a file, the old version will be marked hidden and still be available.</p>
<p>Whether B2 keeps old versions of files or not can be adjusted on a per bucket basis using the "Lifecycle settings" on the B2 control panel or when creating the bucket using the <a href="#b2-lifecycle">--b2-lifecycle</a> flag or after creation using the <a href="#lifecycle">rclone backend lifecycle</a> command.</p>
<p>You may opt in to a "hard delete" of files with the <code>--b2-hard-delete</code> flag which permanently removes files on deletion instead of hiding them.</p>
<p>Old versions of files, where available, are visible using the <code>--b2-versions</code> flag.</p>
<p>It is also possible to view a bucket as it was at a certain point in time, using the <code>--b2-version-at</code> flag. This will show the file versions as they were at that time, showing files that have been deleted afterwards, and hiding files that were created since.</p>
<p>If you wish to remove all the old versions, and unfinished large file uploads, then you can use the <code>rclone cleanup remote:bucket</code> command which will delete all the old versions of files, leaving the current ones intact. You can also supply a path and only old versions under that path will be deleted, e.g. <code>rclone cleanup remote:bucket/path/to/stuff</code>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>cleanup</code> will remove partially uploaded files from the bucket if they are more than a day old. If you want more control over the expiry date then run <code>rclone backend cleanup b2:bucket -o max-age=1h</code> to remove all unfinished large file uploads older than one hour, leaving old versions intact.</p>
<p>If you wish to remove all the old versions, leaving current files and unfinished large files intact, then you can use the <a href="#cleanup-hidden"><code>rclone backend cleanup-hidden remote:bucket</code></a> command. You can also supply a path and only old versions under that path will be deleted, e.g. <code>rclone backend cleanup-hidden remote:bucket/path/to/stuff</code>.</p>
<p>When you <code>purge</code> a bucket, the current and the old versions will be deleted then the bucket will be deleted.</p>
<p>However <code>delete</code> will cause the current versions of the files to become hidden old versions.</p>
<p>Here is a session showing the listing and retrieval of an old version followed by a <code>cleanup</code> of the old versions.</p>
<p>Show current version and all the versions with <code>--b2-versions</code> flag.</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test

        9 one.txt</code></pre>
<h4 id="versions-naming-caveat-1">Versions naming caveat</h4>
<p>When using <code>--b2-versions</code> flag rclone is relying on the file name to work out whether the objects are versions or not. Versions' names are created by inserting timestamp between file name and its extension.</p>
<pre><code>        9 file.txt
        8 file-v2023-07-17-161032-000.txt
       16 file-v2023-06-15-141003-000.txt</code></pre>
<p>If there are real files present with the same names as versions, then behaviour of <code>--b2-versions</code> can be unpredictable.</p>
<h3 id="data-usage">Data usage</h3>
<p>It is useful to know how many requests are sent to the server in different scenarios.</p>
<p>All copy commands send the following 4 requests:</p>
<pre><code>/b2api/v1/b2_authorize_account
/b2api/v1/b2_create_bucket
/b2api/v1/b2_list_buckets
/b2api/v1/b2_list_file_names</code></pre>
<p>The <code>b2_list_file_names</code> request will be sent once for every 1k files in the remote path, providing the checksum and modification time of the listed files. As of version 1.33 issue <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/818">#818</a> causes extra requests to be sent when using B2 with Crypt. When a copy operation does not require any files to be uploaded, no more requests will be sent.</p>
<p>Uploading files that do not require chunking, will send 2 requests per file upload:</p>
<pre><code>/b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_url
/b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/</code></pre>
<p>Uploading files requiring chunking, will send 2 requests (one each to start and finish the upload) and another 2 requests for each chunk:</p>
<pre><code>/b2api/v1/b2_start_large_file
/b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_part_url
/b2api/v1/b2_upload_part/
/b2api/v1/b2_finish_large_file</code></pre>
<h4 id="versions-2">Versions</h4>
<p>Versions can be viewed with the <code>--b2-versions</code> flag. When it is set rclone will show and act on older versions of files. For example</p>
<p>Listing without <code>--b2-versions</code></p>
<pre><code>$ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt</code></pre>
<p>And with</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt
        8 one-v2016-07-04-141032-000.txt
       16 one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
       15 one-v2016-07-02-155621-000.txt</code></pre>
<p>Showing that the current version is unchanged but older versions can be seen. These have the UTC date that they were uploaded to the server to the nearest millisecond appended to them.</p>
<p>Note that when using <code>--b2-versions</code> no file write operations are permitted, so you can't upload files or delete them.</p>
<h3 id="b2-and-rclone-link">B2 and rclone link</h3>
<p>Rclone supports generating file share links for private B2 buckets. They can either be for a file for example:</p>
<pre><code>./rclone link B2:bucket/path/to/file.txt
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file.txt?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
</code></pre>
<p>or if run on a directory you will get:</p>
<pre><code>./rclone link B2:bucket/path
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path?Authorization=xxxxxxxx</code></pre>
<p>you can then use the authorization token (the part of the url from the <code>?Authorization=</code> on) on any file path under that directory. For example:</p>
<pre><code>https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file1?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/file2?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/folder/file3?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
</code></pre>

<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 4</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b2-disable-checksum">--b2-disable-checksum</h4>
<p>Disable checksums for large (&gt; upload cutoff) files.</p>
<p>Normally rclone will calculate the SHA1 checksum of the input before uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files to start uploading.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: disable_checksum</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_B2_DISABLE_CHECKSUM</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b2-download-url">--b2-download-url</h4>
<p>Custom endpoint for downloads.</p>
<p>This is usually set to a Cloudflare CDN URL as Backblaze offers free egress for data downloaded through the Cloudflare network. Rclone works with private buckets by sending an "Authorization" header. If the custom endpoint rewrites the requests for authentication, e.g., in Cloudflare Workers, this header needs to be handled properly. Leave blank if you want to use the endpoint provided by Backblaze.</p>
<p>The URL provided here SHOULD have the protocol and SHOULD NOT have a trailing slash or specify the /file/bucket subpath as rclone will request files with "{download_url}/file/{bucket_name}/{path}".</p>
<p>Example: &gt; https://mysubdomain.mydomain.tld (No trailing "/", "file" or "bucket")</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: download_url</li>

<p>Time before the public link authorization token will expire in s or suffix ms|s|m|h|d.</p>
<p>This is used in combination with "rclone link" for making files accessible to the public and sets the duration before the download authorization token will expire.</p>
<p>The minimum value is 1 second. The maximum value is one week.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: download_auth_duration</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_B2_DOWNLOAD_AUTH_DURATION</li>
<li>Type: Duration</li>
<li>Default: 1w</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b2-memory-pool-flush-time">--b2-memory-pool-flush-time</h4>
<p>How often internal memory buffer pools will be flushed. (no longer used)</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: memory_pool_flush_time</li>

<li>Type: Duration</li>
<li>Default: 1m0s</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b2-memory-pool-use-mmap">--b2-memory-pool-use-mmap</h4>
<p>Whether to use mmap buffers in internal memory pool. (no longer used)</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: memory_pool_use_mmap</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_B2_MEMORY_POOL_USE_MMAP</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b2-lifecycle">--b2-lifecycle</h4>
<p>Set the number of days deleted files should be kept when creating a bucket.</p>
<p>On bucket creation, this parameter is used to create a lifecycle rule for the entire bucket.</p>
<p>If lifecycle is 0 (the default) it does not create a lifecycle rule so the default B2 behaviour applies. This is to create versions of files on delete and overwrite and to keep them indefinitely.</p>
<p>If lifecycle is &gt;0 then it creates a single rule setting the number of days before a file that is deleted or overwritten is deleted permanently. This is known as daysFromHidingToDeleting in the b2 docs.</p>
<p>The minimum value for this parameter is 1 day.</p>
<p>You can also enable hard_delete in the config also which will mean deletions won't cause versions but overwrites will still cause versions to be made.</p>
<p>See: <a href="#lifecycle">rclone backend lifecycle</a> for setting lifecycles after bucket creation.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: lifecycle</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_B2_LIFECYCLE</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 0</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b2-encoding">--b2-encoding</h4>

<li>Env Var: RCLONE_B2_ENCODING</li>
<li>Type: Encoding</li>
<li>Default: Slash,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b2-description">--b2-description</h4>
<p>Description of the remote.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: description</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_B2_DESCRIPTION</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="backend-commands-1">Backend commands</h2>
<p>Here are the commands specific to the b2 backend.</p>
<p>Run them with</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend COMMAND remote:</code></pre>
<p>The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/">backend</a> command for more info on how to pass options and arguments.</p>
<p>These can be run on a running backend using the rc command <a href="https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command">backend/command</a>.</p>
<h3 id="lifecycle">lifecycle</h3>
<p>Read or set the lifecycle for a bucket</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend lifecycle remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This command can be used to read or set the lifecycle for a bucket.</p>
<p>Usage Examples:</p>
<p>To show the current lifecycle rules:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend lifecycle b2:bucket</code></pre>
<p>This will dump something like this showing the lifecycle rules.</p>
<pre><code>[
    {
        &quot;daysFromHidingToDeleting&quot;: 1,
        &quot;daysFromUploadingToHiding&quot;: null,
        &quot;daysFromStartingToCancelingUnfinishedLargeFiles&quot;: null,
        &quot;fileNamePrefix&quot;: &quot;&quot;
    }
]</code></pre>
<p>If there are no lifecycle rules (the default) then it will just return [].</p>
<p>To reset the current lifecycle rules:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend lifecycle b2:bucket -o daysFromHidingToDeleting=30
rclone backend lifecycle b2:bucket -o daysFromUploadingToHiding=5 -o daysFromHidingToDeleting=1</code></pre>
<p>This will run and then print the new lifecycle rules as above.</p>
<p>Rclone only lets you set lifecycles for the whole bucket with the fileNamePrefix = "".</p>
<p>You can't disable versioning with B2. The best you can do is to set the daysFromHidingToDeleting to 1 day. You can enable hard_delete in the config also which will mean deletions won't cause versions but overwrites will still cause versions to be made.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend lifecycle b2:bucket -o daysFromHidingToDeleting=1</code></pre>
<p>See: https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-lifecycle-rules</p>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>"daysFromHidingToDeleting": After a file has been hidden for this many days it is deleted. 0 is off.</li>
<li>"daysFromStartingToCancelingUnfinishedLargeFiles": Cancels any unfinished large file versions after this many days</li>
<li>"daysFromUploadingToHiding": This many days after uploading a file is hidden</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cleanup-3">cleanup</h3>
<p>Remove unfinished large file uploads.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend cleanup remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This command removes unfinished large file uploads of age greater than max-age, which defaults to 24 hours.</p>
<p>Note that you can use --interactive/-i or --dry-run with this command to see what it would do.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend cleanup b2:bucket/path/to/object
rclone backend cleanup -o max-age=7w b2:bucket/path/to/object</code></pre>
<p>Durations are parsed as per the rest of rclone, 2h, 7d, 7w etc.</p>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>"max-age": Max age of upload to delete</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cleanup-hidden-1">cleanup-hidden</h3>
<p>Remove old versions of files.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend cleanup-hidden remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This command removes any old hidden versions of files.</p>
<p>Note that you can use --interactive/-i or --dry-run with this command to see what it would do.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend cleanup-hidden b2:bucket/path/to/dir</code></pre>
<h2 id="limitations-7">Limitations</h2>
<p><code>rclone about</code> is not supported by the B2 backend. Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy <code>mfs</code> (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">List of backends that do not support rclone about</a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/">rclone about</a></p>
<h1 id="box">Box</h1>
<p>Paths are specified as <code>remote:path</code></p>
<p>Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. <code>remote:directory/subdirectory</code>.</p>
<p>The initial setup for Box involves getting a token from Box which you can do either in your browser, or with a config.json downloaded from Box to use JWT authentication. <code>rclone config</code> walks you through it.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-4">Configuration</h2>
<p>Here is an example of how to make a remote called <code>remote</code>. First run:</p>
<pre><code> rclone config</code></pre>
<p>This will guide you through an interactive setup process:</p>

Keep this &quot;remote&quot; remote?
y) Yes this is OK

d) Delete this remote
y/e/d&gt; y</code></pre>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/remote_setup/">remote setup docs</a> for how to set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.</p>
<p>Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the token as returned from Box. This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is on <code>http://127.0.0.1:53682/</code> and this may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.</p>
<p>Once configured you can then use <code>rclone</code> like this,</p>
<p>List directories in top level of your Box</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:</code></pre>
<p>List all the files in your Box</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:</code></pre>
<p>To copy a local directory to an Box directory called backup</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy /home/source remote:backup</code></pre>
<h3 id="using-rclone-with-an-enterprise-account-with-sso">Using rclone with an Enterprise account with SSO</h3>
<p>If you have an "Enterprise" account type with Box with single sign on (SSO), you need to create a password to use Box with rclone. This can be done at your Enterprise Box account by going to Settings, "Account" Tab, and then set the password in the "Authentication" field.</p>
<p>Once you have done this, you can setup your Enterprise Box account using the same procedure detailed above in the, using the password you have just set.</p>
<h3 id="invalid-refresh-token">Invalid refresh token</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="https://developer.box.com/v2.0/docs/oauth-20#section-6-using-the-access-and-refresh-tokens">box docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each refresh_token is valid for one use in 60 days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that if you</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use the box remote for 60 days</li>
<li>Copy the config file with a box refresh token in and use it in two places</li>
<li>Get an error on a token refresh</li>
</ul>
<p>then rclone will return an error which includes the text <code>Invalid refresh token</code>.</p>
<p>To fix this you will need to use oauth2 again to update the refresh token. You can use the methods in <a href="https://rclone.org/remote_setup/">the remote setup docs</a>, bearing in mind that if you use the copy the config file method, you should not use that remote on the computer you did the authentication on.</p>
<p>Here is how to do it.</p>

<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-2">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>Box allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1 second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.</p>
<p>Box supports SHA1 type hashes, so you can use the <code>--checksum</code> flag.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-filename-characters-3">Restricted filename characters</h3>
<p>In addition to the <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters">default restricted characters set</a> the following characters are also replaced:</p>

<p>Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8">replaced</a>, as they can't be used in JSON strings.</p>
<h3 id="transfers-1">Transfers</h3>
<p>For files above 50 MiB rclone will use a chunked transfer. Rclone will upload up to <code>--transfers</code> chunks at the same time (shared among all the multipart uploads). Chunks are buffered in memory and are normally 8 MiB so increasing <code>--transfers</code> will increase memory use.</p>
<h3 id="deleting-files">Deleting files</h3>
<p>Depending on the enterprise settings for your user, the item will either be actually deleted from Box or moved to the trash.</p>
<p>Emptying the trash is supported via the rclone however cleanup command however this deletes every trashed file and folder individually so it may take a very long time. Emptying the trash via the WebUI does not have this limitation so it is advised to empty the trash via the WebUI.</p>
<h3 id="root-folder-id">Root folder ID</h3>
<p>You can set the <code>root_folder_id</code> for rclone. This is the directory (identified by its <code>Folder ID</code>) that rclone considers to be the root of your Box drive.</p>
<p>Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct root to use itself.</p>
<p>However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder hierarchy.</p>
<p>In order to do this you will have to find the <code>Folder ID</code> of the directory you wish rclone to display. This will be the last segment of the URL when you open the relevant folder in the Box web interface.</p>
<p>So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like <code>https://app.box.com/folder/11xxxxxxxxx8</code> in the browser, then you use <code>11xxxxxxxxx8</code> as the <code>root_folder_id</code> in the config.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-8">Limitations</h2>
<p>Note that Box is case insensitive so you can't have a file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".</p>
<p>Box file names can't have the <code>\</code> character in. rclone maps this to and from an identical looking unicode equivalent <code>＼</code> (U+FF3C Fullwidth Reverse Solidus).</p>
<p>Box only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.</p>
<p>Box has <a href="https://developer.box.com/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/rate-limits/">API rate limits</a> that sometimes reduce the speed of rclone.</p>
<p><code>rclone about</code> is not supported by the Box backend. Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy <code>mfs</code> (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">List of backends that do not support rclone about</a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/">rclone about</a></p>
<h2 id="get-your-own-box-app-id">Get your own Box App ID</h2>
<p>Here is how to create your own Box App ID for rclone:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Go to the <a href="https://app.box.com/developers/console">Box Developer Console</a> and login, then click <code>My Apps</code> on the sidebar. Click <code>Create New App</code> and select <code>Custom App</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the first screen on the box that pops up, you can pretty much enter whatever you want. The <code>App Name</code> can be whatever. For <code>Purpose</code> choose automation to avoid having to fill out anything else. Click <code>Next</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the second screen of the creation screen, select <code>User Authentication (OAuth 2.0)</code>. Then click <code>Create App</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You should now be on the <code>Configuration</code> tab of your new app. If not, click on it at the top of the webpage. Copy down <code>Client ID</code> and <code>Client Secret</code>, you'll need those for rclone.</p></li>
<li><p>Under "OAuth 2.0 Redirect URI", add <code>http://127.0.0.1:53682/</code></p></li>
<li><p>For <code>Application Scopes</code>, select <code>Read all files and folders stored in Box</code> and <code>Write all files and folders stored in box</code> (assuming you want to do both). Leave others unchecked. Click <code>Save Changes</code> at the top right.</p></li>

<h1 id="cache">Cache</h1>
<p>The <code>cache</code> remote wraps another existing remote and stores file structure and its data for long running tasks like <code>rclone mount</code>.</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p>The cache backend code is working but it currently doesn't have a maintainer so there are <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+label%3A%22Remote%3A+Cache%22">outstanding bugs</a> which aren't getting fixed.</p>
<p>The cache backend is due to be phased out in favour of the VFS caching layer eventually which is more tightly integrated into rclone.</p>
<p>Until this happens we recommend only using the cache backend if you find you can't work without it. There are many docs online describing the use of the cache backend to minimize API hits and by-and-large these are out of date and the cache backend isn't needed in those scenarios any more.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-5">Configuration</h2>
<p>To get started you just need to have an existing remote which can be configured with <code>cache</code>.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to make a remote called <code>test-cache</code>. First run:</p>
<pre><code> rclone config</code></pre>
<p>This will guide you through an interactive setup process:</p>
<pre><code>No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config

<h3 id="write-features">Write Features</h3>
<h3 id="offline-uploading">Offline uploading</h3>
<p>In an effort to make writing through cache more reliable, the backend now supports this feature which can be activated by specifying a <code>cache-tmp-upload-path</code>.</p>
<p>A files goes through these states when using this feature:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>An upload is started (usually by copying a file on the cache remote)</li>
<li>When the copy to the temporary location is complete the file is part of the cached remote and looks and behaves like any other file (reading included)</li>
<li>After <code>cache-tmp-wait-time</code> passes and the file is next in line, <code>rclone move</code> is used to move the file to the cloud provider</li>
<li>Reading the file still works during the upload but most modifications on it will be prohibited</li>
<li>Once the move is complete the file is unlocked for modifications as it becomes as any other regular file</li>
<li>If the file is being read through <code>cache</code> when it's actually deleted from the temporary path then <code>cache</code> will simply swap the source to the cloud provider without interrupting the reading (small blip can happen though)</li>
</ol>
<p>Files are uploaded in sequence and only one file is uploaded at a time. Uploads will be stored in a queue and be processed based on the order they were added. The queue and the temporary storage is persistent across restarts but can be cleared on startup with the <code>--cache-db-purge</code> flag.</p>
<h3 id="write-support">Write Support</h3>
<p>Writes are supported through <code>cache</code>. One caveat is that a mounted cache remote does not add any retry or fallback mechanism to the upload operation. This will depend on the implementation of the wrapped remote. Consider using <code>Offline uploading</code> for reliable writes.</p>
<p>One special case is covered with <code>cache-writes</code> which will cache the file data at the same time as the upload when it is enabled making it available from the cache store immediately once the upload is finished.</p>
<h3 id="read-features">Read Features</h3>
<h4 id="multiple-connections">Multiple connections</h4>
<p>To counter the high latency between a local PC where rclone is running and cloud providers, the cache remote can split multiple requests to the cloud provider for smaller file chunks and combines them together locally where they can be available almost immediately before the reader usually needs them.</p>
<p>This is similar to buffering when media files are played online. Rclone will stay around the current marker but always try its best to stay ahead and prepare the data before.</p>
<h4 id="plex-integration">Plex Integration</h4>
<p>There is a direct integration with Plex which allows cache to detect during reading if the file is in playback or not. This helps cache to adapt how it queries the cloud provider depending on what is needed for.</p>
<p>Scans will have a minimum amount of workers (1) while in a confirmed playback cache will deploy the configured number of workers.</p>
<p>This integration opens the doorway to additional performance improvements which will be explored in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If Plex options are not configured, <code>cache</code> will function with its configured options without adapting any of its settings.</p>
<p>How to enable? Run <code>rclone config</code> and add all the Plex options (endpoint, username and password) in your remote and it will be automatically enabled.</p>
<p>Affected settings: - <code>cache-workers</code>: <em>Configured value</em> during confirmed playback or <em>1</em> all the other times</p>
<h5 id="certificate-validation">Certificate Validation</h5>
<p>When the Plex server is configured to only accept secure connections, it is possible to use <code>.plex.direct</code> URLs to ensure certificate validation succeeds. These URLs are used by Plex internally to connect to the Plex server securely.</p>
<p>The format for these URLs is the following:</p>
<p><code>https://ip-with-dots-replaced.server-hash.plex.direct:32400/</code></p>
<p>The <code>ip-with-dots-replaced</code> part can be any IPv4 address, where the dots have been replaced with dashes, e.g. <code>127.0.0.1</code> becomes <code>127-0-0-1</code>.</p>
<p>To get the <code>server-hash</code> part, the easiest way is to visit</p>
<p>https://plex.tv/api/resources?includeHttps=1&amp;X-Plex-Token=your-plex-token</p>
<p>This page will list all the available Plex servers for your account with at least one <code>.plex.direct</code> link for each. Copy one URL and replace the IP address with the desired address. This can be used as the <code>plex_url</code> value.</p>
<h3 id="known-issues">Known issues</h3>
<h4 id="mount-and---dir-cache-time">Mount and --dir-cache-time</h4>
<p>--dir-cache-time controls the first layer of directory caching which works at the mount layer. Being an independent caching mechanism from the <code>cache</code> backend, it will manage its own entries based on the configured time.</p>
<p>To avoid getting in a scenario where dir cache has obsolete data and cache would have the correct one, try to set <code>--dir-cache-time</code> to a lower time than <code>--cache-info-age</code>. Default values are already configured in this way.</p>
<h4 id="windows-support---experimental">Windows support - Experimental</h4>
<p>There are a couple of issues with Windows <code>mount</code> functionality that still require some investigations. It should be considered as experimental thus far as fixes come in for this OS.</p>
<p>Most of the issues seem to be related to the difference between filesystems on Linux flavors and Windows as cache is heavily dependent on them.</p>
<p>Any reports or feedback on how cache behaves on this OS is greatly appreciated.</p>
<ul>

<li>https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1907</li>
<li>https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1834</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="risk-of-throttling">Risk of throttling</h4>
<p>Future iterations of the cache backend will make use of the pooling functionality of the cloud provider to synchronize and at the same time make writing through it more tolerant to failures.</p>
<p>There are a couple of enhancements in track to add these but in the meantime there is a valid concern that the expiring cache listings can lead to cloud provider throttles or bans due to repeated queries on it for very large mounts.</p>
<p>Some recommendations: - don't use a very small interval for entry information (<code>--cache-info-age</code>) - while writes aren't yet optimised, you can still write through <code>cache</code> which gives you the advantage of adding the file in the cache at the same time if configured to do so.</p>
<p>Future enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1937</li>
<li>https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1936</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-and-crypt">cache and crypt</h4>
<p>One common scenario is to keep your data encrypted in the cloud provider using the <code>crypt</code> remote. <code>crypt</code> uses a similar technique to wrap around an existing remote and handles this translation in a seamless way.</p>
<p>There is an issue with wrapping the remotes in this order: <strong>cloud remote</strong> -&gt; <strong>crypt</strong> -&gt; <strong>cache</strong></p>
<p>During testing, I experienced a lot of bans with the remotes in this order. I suspect it might be related to how crypt opens files on the cloud provider which makes it think we're downloading the full file instead of small chunks. Organizing the remotes in this order yields better results: <strong>cloud remote</strong> -&gt; <strong>cache</strong> -&gt; <strong>crypt</strong></p>
<h4 id="absolute-remote-paths">absolute remote paths</h4>
<p><code>cache</code> can not differentiate between relative and absolute paths for the wrapped remote. Any path given in the <code>remote</code> config setting and on the command line will be passed to the wrapped remote as is, but for storing the chunks on disk the path will be made relative by removing any leading <code>/</code> character.</p>
<p>This behavior is irrelevant for most backend types, but there are backends where a leading <code>/</code> changes the effective directory, e.g. in the <code>sftp</code> backend paths starting with a <code>/</code> are relative to the root of the SSH server and paths without are relative to the user home directory. As a result <code>sftp:bin</code> and <code>sftp:/bin</code> will share the same cache folder, even if they represent a different directory on the SSH server.</p>
<h3 id="cache-and-remote-control---rc">Cache and Remote Control (--rc)</h3>
<p>Cache supports the new <code>--rc</code> mode in rclone and can be remote controlled through the following end points: By default, the listener is disabled if you do not add the flag.</p>
<h3 id="rc-cacheexpire">rc cache/expire</h3>
<p>Purge a remote from the cache backend. Supports either a directory or a file. It supports both encrypted and unencrypted file names if cache is wrapped by crypt.</p>
<p>Params: - <strong>remote</strong> = path to remote <strong>(required)</strong> - <strong>withData</strong> = true/false to delete cached data (chunks) as well <em>(optional, false by default)</em></p>

<h3 id="advanced-options-5">Advanced options</h3>
<p>Here are the Advanced options specific to cache (Cache a remote).</p>
<h4 id="cache-plex-token">--cache-plex-token</h4>
<p>The plex token for authentication - auto set normally.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: plex_token</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_TOKEN</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-plex-insecure">--cache-plex-insecure</h4>
<p>Skip all certificate verification when connecting to the Plex server.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: plex_insecure</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_INSECURE</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-db-path">--cache-db-path</h4>
<p>Directory to store file structure metadata DB.</p>
<p>The remote name is used as the DB file name.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: db_path</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_DB_PATH</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Default: "$HOME/.cache/rclone/cache-backend"</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-chunk-path">--cache-chunk-path</h4>
<p>Directory to cache chunk files.</p>
<p>Path to where partial file data (chunks) are stored locally. The remote name is appended to the final path.</p>
<p>This config follows the "--cache-db-path". If you specify a custom location for "--cache-db-path" and don't specify one for "--cache-chunk-path" then "--cache-chunk-path" will use the same path as "--cache-db-path".</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: chunk_path</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_PATH</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Default: "$HOME/.cache/rclone/cache-backend"</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-db-purge">--cache-db-purge</h4>
<p>Clear all the cached data for this remote on start.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: db_purge</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_DB_PURGE</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-chunk-clean-interval">--cache-chunk-clean-interval</h4>
<p>How often should the cache perform cleanups of the chunk storage.</p>
<p>The default value should be ok for most people. If you find that the cache goes over "cache-chunk-total-size" too often then try to lower this value to force it to perform cleanups more often.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: chunk_clean_interval</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_CLEAN_INTERVAL</li>
<li>Type: Duration</li>
<li>Default: 1m0s</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-read-retries">--cache-read-retries</h4>
<p>How many times to retry a read from a cache storage.</p>
<p>Since reading from a cache stream is independent from downloading file data, readers can get to a point where there's no more data in the cache. Most of the times this can indicate a connectivity issue if cache isn't able to provide file data anymore.</p>
<p>For really slow connections, increase this to a point where the stream is able to provide data but your experience will be very stuttering.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: read_retries</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_READ_RETRIES</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 10</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-workers">--cache-workers</h4>
<p>How many workers should run in parallel to download chunks.</p>
<p>Higher values will mean more parallel processing (better CPU needed) and more concurrent requests on the cloud provider. This impacts several aspects like the cloud provider API limits, more stress on the hardware that rclone runs on but it also means that streams will be more fluid and data will be available much more faster to readers.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the optional Plex integration is enabled then this setting will adapt to the type of reading performed and the value specified here will be used as a maximum number of workers to use.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: workers</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_WORKERS</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 4</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-chunk-no-memory">--cache-chunk-no-memory</h4>
<p>Disable the in-memory cache for storing chunks during streaming.</p>
<p>By default, cache will keep file data during streaming in RAM as well to provide it to readers as fast as possible.</p>
<p>This transient data is evicted as soon as it is read and the number of chunks stored doesn't exceed the number of workers. However, depending on other settings like "cache-chunk-size" and "cache-workers" this footprint can increase if there are parallel streams too (multiple files being read at the same time).</p>
<p>If the hardware permits it, use this feature to provide an overall better performance during streaming but it can also be disabled if RAM is not available on the local machine.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: chunk_no_memory</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_NO_MEMORY</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-rps">--cache-rps</h4>
<p>Limits the number of requests per second to the source FS (-1 to disable).</p>
<p>This setting places a hard limit on the number of requests per second that cache will be doing to the cloud provider remote and try to respect that value by setting waits between reads.</p>
<p>If you find that you're getting banned or limited on the cloud provider through cache and know that a smaller number of requests per second will allow you to work with it then you can use this setting for that.</p>
<p>A good balance of all the other settings should make this setting useless but it is available to set for more special cases.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This will limit the number of requests during streams but other API calls to the cloud provider like directory listings will still pass.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: rps</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_RPS</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: -1</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-writes">--cache-writes</h4>
<p>Cache file data on writes through the FS.</p>
<p>If you need to read files immediately after you upload them through cache you can enable this flag to have their data stored in the cache store at the same time during upload.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: writes</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_WRITES</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-tmp-upload-path">--cache-tmp-upload-path</h4>
<p>Directory to keep temporary files until they are uploaded.</p>
<p>This is the path where cache will use as a temporary storage for new files that need to be uploaded to the cloud provider.</p>
<p>Specifying a value will enable this feature. Without it, it is completely disabled and files will be uploaded directly to the cloud provider</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: tmp_upload_path</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_TMP_UPLOAD_PATH</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-tmp-wait-time">--cache-tmp-wait-time</h4>
<p>How long should files be stored in local cache before being uploaded.</p>
<p>This is the duration that a file must wait in the temporary location <em>cache-tmp-upload-path</em> before it is selected for upload.</p>
<p>Note that only one file is uploaded at a time and it can take longer to start the upload if a queue formed for this purpose.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: tmp_wait_time</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_TMP_WAIT_TIME</li>
<li>Type: Duration</li>
<li>Default: 15s</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-db-wait-time">--cache-db-wait-time</h4>
<p>How long to wait for the DB to be available - 0 is unlimited.</p>
<p>Only one process can have the DB open at any one time, so rclone waits for this duration for the DB to become available before it gives an error.</p>
<p>If you set it to 0 then it will wait forever.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: db_wait_time</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_DB_WAIT_TIME</li>
<li>Type: Duration</li>
<li>Default: 1s</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cache-description">--cache-description</h4>
<p>Description of the remote.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: description</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_DESCRIPTION</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="backend-commands-2">Backend commands</h2>
<p>Here are the commands specific to the cache backend.</p>
<p>Run them with</p>

<p>The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/">backend</a> command for more info on how to pass options and arguments.</p>
<p>These can be run on a running backend using the rc command <a href="https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command">backend/command</a>.</p>

<p>Print stats on the cache backend in JSON format.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend stats remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<h1 id="chunker">Chunker</h1>
<p>The <code>chunker</code> overlay transparently splits large files into smaller chunks during upload to wrapped remote and transparently assembles them back when the file is downloaded. This allows to effectively overcome size limits imposed by storage providers.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-6">Configuration</h2>
<p>To use it, first set up the underlying remote following the configuration instructions for that remote. You can also use a local pathname instead of a remote.</p>
<p>First check your chosen remote is working - we'll call it <code>remote:path</code> here. Note that anything inside <code>remote:path</code> will be chunked and anything outside won't. This means that if you are using a bucket-based remote (e.g. S3, B2, swift) then you should probably put the bucket in the remote <code>s3:bucket</code>.</p>
<p>Now configure <code>chunker</code> using <code>rclone config</code>. We will call this one <code>overlay</code> to separate it from the <code>remote</code> itself.</p>
<pre><code>No remotes found, make a new one?

<h3 id="specifying-the-remote">Specifying the remote</h3>
<p>In normal use, make sure the remote has a <code>:</code> in. If you specify the remote without a <code>:</code> then rclone will use a local directory of that name. So if you use a remote of <code>/path/to/secret/files</code> then rclone will chunk stuff in that directory. If you use a remote of <code>name</code> then rclone will put files in a directory called <code>name</code> in the current directory.</p>
<h3 id="chunking">Chunking</h3>
<p>When rclone starts a file upload, chunker checks the file size. If it doesn't exceed the configured chunk size, chunker will just pass the file to the wrapped remote (however, see caveat below). If a file is large, chunker will transparently cut data in pieces with temporary names and stream them one by one, on the fly. Each data chunk will contain the specified number of bytes, except for the last one which may have less data. If file size is unknown in advance (this is called a streaming upload), chunker will internally create a temporary copy, record its size and repeat the above process.</p>
<p>When upload completes, temporary chunk files are finally renamed. This scheme guarantees that operations can be run in parallel and look from outside as atomic. A similar method with hidden temporary chunks is used for other operations (copy/move/rename, etc.). If an operation fails, hidden chunks are normally destroyed, and the target composite file stays intact.</p>
<p>When a composite file download is requested, chunker transparently assembles it by concatenating data chunks in order. As the split is trivial one could even manually concatenate data chunks together to obtain the original content.</p>
<p>When the <code>list</code> rclone command scans a directory on wrapped remote, the potential chunk files are accounted for, grouped and assembled into composite directory entries. Any temporary chunks are hidden.</p>
<p>List and other commands can sometimes come across composite files with missing or invalid chunks, e.g. shadowed by like-named directory or another file. This usually means that wrapped file system has been directly tampered with or damaged. If chunker detects a missing chunk it will by default print warning, skip the whole incomplete group of chunks but proceed with current command. You can set the <code>--chunker-fail-hard</code> flag to have commands abort with error message in such cases.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat</strong>: As it is now, chunker will always create a temporary file in the backend and then rename it, even if the file is below the chunk threshold. This will result in unnecessary API calls and can severely restrict throughput when handling transfers primarily composed of small files on some backends (e.g. Box). A workaround to this issue is to use chunker only for files above the chunk threshold via <code>--min-size</code> and then perform a separate call without chunker on the remaining files.</p>
<h4 id="chunk-names">Chunk names</h4>
<p>The default chunk name format is <code>*.rclone_chunk.###</code>, hence by default chunk names are <code>BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.001</code>, <code>BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.002</code> etc. You can configure another name format using the <code>name_format</code> configuration file option. The format uses asterisk <code>*</code> as a placeholder for the base file name and one or more consecutive hash characters <code>#</code> as a placeholder for sequential chunk number. There must be one and only one asterisk. The number of consecutive hash characters defines the minimum length of a string representing a chunk number. If decimal chunk number has less digits than the number of hashes, it is left-padded by zeros. If the decimal string is longer, it is left intact. By default numbering starts from 1 but there is another option that allows user to start from 0, e.g. for compatibility with legacy software.</p>
<p>For example, if name format is <code>big_*-##.part</code> and original file name is <code>data.txt</code> and numbering starts from 0, then the first chunk will be named <code>big_data.txt-00.part</code>, the 99th chunk will be <code>big_data.txt-98.part</code> and the 302nd chunk will become <code>big_data.txt-301.part</code>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>list</code> assembles composite directory entries only when chunk names match the configured format and treats non-conforming file names as normal non-chunked files.</p>
<p>When using <code>norename</code> transactions, chunk names will additionally have a unique file version suffix. For example, <code>BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.001_bp562k</code>.</p>
<h3 id="metadata-4">Metadata</h3>
<p>Besides data chunks chunker will by default create metadata object for a composite file. The object is named after the original file. Chunker allows user to disable metadata completely (the <code>none</code> format). Note that metadata is normally not created for files smaller than the configured chunk size. This may change in future rclone releases.</p>
<h4 id="simple-json-metadata-format">Simple JSON metadata format</h4>
<p>This is the default format. It supports hash sums and chunk validation for composite files. Meta objects carry the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ver</code> - version of format, currently <code>1</code></li>
<li><code>size</code> - total size of composite file</li>
<li><code>nchunks</code> - number of data chunks in file</li>
<li><code>md5</code> - MD5 hashsum of composite file (if present)</li>
<li><code>sha1</code> - SHA1 hashsum (if present)</li>
<li><code>txn</code> - identifies current version of the file</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no field for composite file name as it's simply equal to the name of meta object on the wrapped remote. Please refer to respective sections for details on hashsums and modified time handling.</p>
<h4 id="no-metadata">No metadata</h4>
<p>You can disable meta objects by setting the meta format option to <code>none</code>. In this mode chunker will scan directory for all files that follow configured chunk name format, group them by detecting chunks with the same base name and show group names as virtual composite files. This method is more prone to missing chunk errors (especially missing last chunk) than format with metadata enabled.</p>
<h3 id="hashsums">Hashsums</h3>
<p>Chunker supports hashsums only when a compatible metadata is present. Hence, if you choose metadata format of <code>none</code>, chunker will report hashsum as <code>UNSUPPORTED</code>.</p>
<p>Please note that by default metadata is stored only for composite files. If a file is smaller than configured chunk size, chunker will transparently redirect hash requests to wrapped remote, so support depends on that. You will see the empty string as a hashsum of requested type for small files if the wrapped remote doesn't support it.</p>
<p>Many storage backends support MD5 and SHA1 hash types, so does chunker. With chunker you can choose one or another but not both. MD5 is set by default as the most supported type. Since chunker keeps hashes for composite files and falls back to the wrapped remote hash for non-chunked ones, we advise you to choose the same hash type as supported by wrapped remote so that your file listings look coherent.</p>
<p>If your storage backend does not support MD5 or SHA1 but you need consistent file hashing, configure chunker with <code>md5all</code> or <code>sha1all</code>. These two modes guarantee given hash for all files. If wrapped remote doesn't support it, chunker will then add metadata to all files, even small. However, this can double the amount of small files in storage and incur additional service charges. You can even use chunker to force md5/sha1 support in any other remote at expense of sidecar meta objects by setting e.g. <code>hash_type=sha1all</code> to force hashsums and <code>chunk_size=1P</code> to effectively disable chunking.</p>
<p>Normally, when a file is copied to chunker controlled remote, chunker will ask the file source for compatible file hash and revert to on-the-fly calculation if none is found. This involves some CPU overhead but provides a guarantee that given hashsum is available. Also, chunker will reject a server-side copy or move operation if source and destination hashsum types are different resulting in the extra network bandwidth, too. In some rare cases this may be undesired, so chunker provides two optional choices: <code>sha1quick</code> and <code>md5quick</code>. If the source does not support primary hash type and the quick mode is enabled, chunker will try to fall back to the secondary type. This will save CPU and bandwidth but can result in empty hashsums at destination. Beware of consequences: the <code>sync</code> command will revert (sometimes silently) to time/size comparison if compatible hashsums between source and target are not found.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-3">Modification times</h3>
<p>Chunker stores modification times using the wrapped remote so support depends on that. For a small non-chunked file the chunker overlay simply manipulates modification time of the wrapped remote file. For a composite file with metadata chunker will get and set modification time of the metadata object on the wrapped remote. If file is chunked but metadata format is <code>none</code> then chunker will use modification time of the first data chunk.</p>
<h3 id="migrations">Migrations</h3>
<p>The idiomatic way to migrate to a different chunk size, hash type, transaction style or chunk naming scheme is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect all your chunked files under a directory and have your chunker remote point to it.</li>
<li>Create another directory (most probably on the same cloud storage) and configure a new remote with desired metadata format, hash type, chunk naming etc.</li>
<li>Now run <code>rclone sync --interactive oldchunks: newchunks:</code> and all your data will be transparently converted in transfer. This may take some time, yet chunker will try server-side copy if possible.</li>
<li>After checking data integrity you may remove configuration section of the old remote.</li>
</ul>
<p>If rclone gets killed during a long operation on a big composite file, hidden temporary chunks may stay in the directory. They will not be shown by the <code>list</code> command but will eat up your account quota. Please note that the <code>deletefile</code> command deletes only active chunks of a file. As a workaround, you can use remote of the wrapped file system to see them. An easy way to get rid of hidden garbage is to copy littered directory somewhere using the chunker remote and purge the original directory. The <code>copy</code> command will copy only active chunks while the <code>purge</code> will remove everything including garbage.</p>
<h3 id="caveats-and-limitations">Caveats and Limitations</h3>
<p>Chunker requires wrapped remote to support server-side <code>move</code> (or <code>copy</code> + <code>delete</code>) operations, otherwise it will explicitly refuse to start. This is because it internally renames temporary chunk files to their final names when an operation completes successfully.</p>
<p>Chunker encodes chunk number in file name, so with default <code>name_format</code> setting it adds 17 characters. Also chunker adds 7 characters of temporary suffix during operations. Many file systems limit base file name without path by 255 characters. Using rclone's crypt remote as a base file system limits file name by 143 characters. Thus, maximum name length is 231 for most files and 119 for chunker-over-crypt. A user in need can change name format to e.g. <code>*.rcc##</code> and save 10 characters (provided at most 99 chunks per file).</p>
<p>Note that a move implemented using the copy-and-delete method may incur double charging with some cloud storage providers.</p>
<p>Chunker will not automatically rename existing chunks when you run <code>rclone config</code> on a live remote and change the chunk name format. Beware that in result of this some files which have been treated as chunks before the change can pop up in directory listings as normal files and vice versa. The same warning holds for the chunk size. If you desperately need to change critical chunking settings, you should run data migration as described above.</p>
<p>If wrapped remote is case insensitive, the chunker overlay will inherit that property (so you can't have a file called "Hello.doc" and "hello.doc" in the same directory).</p>
<p>Chunker included in rclone releases up to <code>v1.54</code> can sometimes fail to detect metadata produced by recent versions of rclone. We recommend users to keep rclone up-to-date to avoid data corruption.</p>
<p>Changing <code>transactions</code> is dangerous and requires explicit migration.</p>

y/e/d&gt; y</code></pre>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/remote_setup/">remote setup docs</a> for how to set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.</p>
<p>Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the token as returned from Citrix ShareFile. This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is on <code>http://127.0.0.1:53682/</code> and this it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.</p>
<p>Once configured you can then use <code>rclone</code> like this,</p>
<p>List directories in top level of your ShareFile</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:</code></pre>
<p>List all the files in your ShareFile</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:</code></pre>
<p>To copy a local directory to an ShareFile directory called backup</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy /home/source remote:backup</code></pre>
<p>Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. <code>remote:directory/subdirectory</code>.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-3">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>ShareFile allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1 second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.</p>
<p>ShareFile supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the <code>--checksum</code> flag.</p>
<h3 id="transfers-2">Transfers</h3>
<p>For files above 128 MiB rclone will use a chunked transfer. Rclone will upload up to <code>--transfers</code> chunks at the same time (shared among all the multipart uploads). Chunks are buffered in memory and are normally 64 MiB so increasing <code>--transfers</code> will increase memory use.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-filename-characters-4">Restricted filename characters</h3>
<p>In addition to the <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters">default restricted characters set</a> the following characters are also replaced:</p>

<p>Note that ShareFile is case insensitive so you can't have a file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".</p>
<p>ShareFile only supports filenames up to 256 characters in length.</p>
<p><code>rclone about</code> is not supported by the Citrix ShareFile backend. Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy <code>mfs</code> (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">List of backends that do not support rclone about</a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/">rclone about</a></p>
<h1 id="crypt">Crypt</h1>
<p>Rclone <code>crypt</code> remotes encrypt and decrypt other remotes.</p>
<p>A remote of type <code>crypt</code> does not access a <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/">storage system</a> directly, but instead wraps another remote, which in turn accesses the storage system. This is similar to how <a href="https://rclone.org/alias/">alias</a>, <a href="https://rclone.org/union/">union</a>, <a href="https://rclone.org/chunker/">chunker</a> and a few others work. It makes the usage very flexible, as you can add a layer, in this case an encryption layer, on top of any other backend, even in multiple layers. Rclone's functionality can be used as with any other remote, for example you can <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/">mount</a> a crypt remote.</p>
<p>Accessing a storage system through a crypt remote realizes client-side encryption, which makes it safe to keep your data in a location you do not trust will not get compromised. When working against the <code>crypt</code> remote, rclone will automatically encrypt (before uploading) and decrypt (after downloading) on your local system as needed on the fly, leaving the data encrypted at rest in the wrapped remote. If you access the storage system using an application other than rclone, or access the wrapped remote directly using rclone, there will not be any encryption/decryption: Downloading existing content will just give you the encrypted (scrambled) format, and anything you upload will <em>not</em> become encrypted.</p>
<p>The encryption is a secret-key encryption (also called symmetric key encryption) algorithm, where a password (or pass phrase) is used to generate real encryption key. The password can be supplied by user, or you may chose to let rclone generate one. It will be stored in the configuration file, in a lightly obscured form. If you are in an environment where you are not able to keep your configuration secured, you should add <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#configuration-encryption">configuration encryption</a> as protection. As long as you have this configuration file, you will be able to decrypt your data. Without the configuration file, as long as you remember the password (or keep it in a safe place), you can re-create the configuration and gain access to the existing data. You may also configure a corresponding remote in a different installation to access the same data. See below for guidance to <a href="#changing-password">changing password</a>.</p>
<p>Encryption uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)">cryptographic salt</a>, to permute the encryption key so that the same string may be encrypted in different ways. When configuring the crypt remote it is optional to enter a salt, or to let rclone generate a unique salt. If omitted, rclone uses a built-in unique string. Normally in cryptography, the salt is stored together with the encrypted content, and do not have to be memorized by the user. This is not the case in rclone, because rclone does not store any additional information on the remotes. Use of custom salt is effectively a second password that must be memorized.</p>
<p><a href="#file-encryption">File content</a> encryption is performed using <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox">NaCl SecretBox</a>, based on XSalsa20 cipher and Poly1305 for integrity. <a href="#name-encryption">Names</a> (file- and directory names) are also encrypted by default, but this has some implications and is therefore possible to be turned off.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-9">Configuration</h2>
<p>Here is an example of how to make a remote called <code>secret</code>.</p>
<p>To use <code>crypt</code>, first set up the underlying remote. Follow the <code>rclone config</code> instructions for the specific backend.</p>
<p>Before configuring the crypt remote, check the underlying remote is working. In this example the underlying remote is called <code>remote</code>. We will configure a path <code>path</code> within this remote to contain the encrypted content. Anything inside <code>remote:path</code> will be encrypted and anything outside will not.</p>
<p>Configure <code>crypt</code> using <code>rclone config</code>. In this example the <code>crypt</code> remote is called <code>secret</code>, to differentiate it from the underlying <code>remote</code>.</p>
<p>When you are done you can use the crypt remote named <code>secret</code> just as you would with any other remote, e.g. <code>rclone copy D:\docs secret:\docs</code>, and rclone will encrypt and decrypt as needed on the fly. If you access the wrapped remote <code>remote:path</code> directly you will bypass the encryption, and anything you read will be in encrypted form, and anything you write will be unencrypted. To avoid issues it is best to configure a dedicated path for encrypted content, and access it exclusively through a crypt remote.</p>

<p><strong>Important</strong> The crypt password stored in <code>rclone.conf</code> is lightly obscured. That only protects it from cursory inspection. It is not secure unless <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#configuration-encryption">configuration encryption</a> of <code>rclone.conf</code> is specified.</p>
<p>A long passphrase is recommended, or <code>rclone config</code> can generate a random one.</p>
<p>The obscured password is created using AES-CTR with a static key. The IV (nonce) is stored verbatim at the beginning of the obscured password. This static key is shared between all versions of rclone.</p>
<p>If you reconfigure rclone with the same passwords/passphrases elsewhere it will be compatible, but the obscured version will be different due to the different salt.</p>
<p>Rclone does not encrypt</p>
<ul>
<li>file length - this can be calculated within 16 bytes</li>
<li>modification time - used for syncing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="specifying-the-remote-1">Specifying the remote</h3>
<p>When configuring the remote to encrypt/decrypt, you may specify any string that rclone accepts as a source/destination of other commands.</p>
<p>The primary use case is to specify the path into an already configured remote (e.g. <code>remote:path/to/dir</code> or <code>remote:bucket</code>), such that data in a remote untrusted location can be stored encrypted.</p>
<p>You may also specify a local filesystem path, such as <code>/path/to/dir</code> on Linux, <code>C:\path\to\dir</code> on Windows. By creating a crypt remote pointing to such a local filesystem path, you can use rclone as a utility for pure local file encryption, for example to keep encrypted files on a removable USB drive.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A string which do not contain a <code>:</code> will by rclone be treated as a relative path in the local filesystem. For example, if you enter the name <code>remote</code> without the trailing <code>:</code>, it will be treated as a subdirectory of the current directory with name "remote".</p>
<p>If a path <code>remote:path/to/dir</code> is specified, rclone stores encrypted files in <code>path/to/dir</code> on the remote. With file name encryption, files saved to <code>secret:subdir/subfile</code> are stored in the unencrypted path <code>path/to/dir</code> but the <code>subdir/subpath</code> element is encrypted.</p>
<p>The path you specify does not have to exist, rclone will create it when needed.</p>
<p>If you intend to use the wrapped remote both directly for keeping unencrypted content, as well as through a crypt remote for encrypted content, it is recommended to point the crypt remote to a separate directory within the wrapped remote. If you use a bucket-based storage system (e.g. Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2) it is generally advisable to wrap the crypt remote around a specific bucket (<code>s3:bucket</code>). If wrapping around the entire root of the storage (<code>s3:</code>), and use the optional file name encryption, rclone will encrypt the bucket name.</p>
<h3 id="changing-password">Changing password</h3>
<p>Should the password, or the configuration file containing a lightly obscured form of the password, be compromised, you need to re-encrypt your data with a new password. Since rclone uses secret-key encryption, where the encryption key is generated directly from the password kept on the client, it is not possible to change the password/key of already encrypted content. Just changing the password configured for an existing crypt remote means you will no longer able to decrypt any of the previously encrypted content. The only possibility is to re-upload everything via a crypt remote configured with your new password.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of your data, your bandwidth, storage quota etc, there are different approaches you can take: - If you have everything in a different location, for example on your local system, you could remove all of the prior encrypted files, change the password for your configured crypt remote (or delete and re-create the crypt configuration), and then re-upload everything from the alternative location. - If you have enough space on the storage system you can create a new crypt remote pointing to a separate directory on the same backend, and then use rclone to copy everything from the original crypt remote to the new, effectively decrypting everything on the fly using the old password and re-encrypting using the new password. When done, delete the original crypt remote directory and finally the rclone crypt configuration with the old password. All data will be streamed from the storage system and back, so you will get half the bandwidth and be charged twice if you have upload and download quota on the storage system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A security problem related to the random password generator was fixed in rclone version 1.53.3 (released 2020-11-19). Passwords generated by rclone config in version 1.49.0 (released 2019-08-26) to 1.53.2 (released 2020-10-26) are not considered secure and should be changed. If you made up your own password, or used rclone version older than 1.49.0 or newer than 1.53.2 to generate it, you are <em>not</em> affected by this issue. See <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4783">issue #4783</a> for more details, and a tool you can use to check if you are affected.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Create the following file structure using "standard" file name encryption.</p>
<pre><code>plaintext/
├── file0.txt
├── file1.txt
└── subdir
    ├── file2.txt
    ├── file3.txt
    └── subsubdir
        └── file4.txt</code></pre>
<p>Copy these to the remote, and list them</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone -q copy plaintext secret:
$ rclone -q ls secret:
        7 file1.txt
        6 file0.txt
        8 subdir/file2.txt
       10 subdir/subsubdir/file4.txt
        9 subdir/file3.txt</code></pre>
<p>The crypt remote looks like</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone -q ls remote:path
       55 hagjclgavj2mbiqm6u6cnjjqcg
       54 v05749mltvv1tf4onltun46gls
       57 86vhrsv86mpbtd3a0akjuqslj8/dlj7fkq4kdq72emafg7a7s41uo
       58 86vhrsv86mpbtd3a0akjuqslj8/7uu829995du6o42n32otfhjqp4/b9pausrfansjth5ob3jkdqd4lc
       56 86vhrsv86mpbtd3a0akjuqslj8/8njh1sk437gttmep3p70g81aps</code></pre>
<p>The directory structure is preserved</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone -q ls secret:subdir
        8 file2.txt
        9 file3.txt
       10 subsubdir/file4.txt</code></pre>
<p>Without file name encryption <code>.bin</code> extensions are added to underlying names. This prevents the cloud provider attempting to interpret file content.</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone -q ls remote:path
       54 file0.txt.bin
       57 subdir/file3.txt.bin
       56 subdir/file2.txt.bin
       58 subdir/subsubdir/file4.txt.bin
       55 file1.txt.bin</code></pre>
<h3 id="file-name-encryption-modes">File name encryption modes</h3>
<p>Off</p>
<ul>
<li>doesn't hide file names or directory structure</li>
<li>allows for longer file names (~246 characters)</li>
<li>can use sub paths and copy single files</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard</p>
<ul>
<li>file names encrypted</li>
<li>file names can't be as long (~143 characters)</li>
<li>can use sub paths and copy single files</li>
<li>directory structure visible</li>
<li>identical files names will have identical uploaded names</li>
<li>can use shortcuts to shorten the directory recursion</li>
</ul>
<p>Obfuscation</p>
<p>This is a simple "rotate" of the filename, with each file having a rot distance based on the filename. Rclone stores the distance at the beginning of the filename. A file called "hello" may become "53.jgnnq".</p>
<p>Obfuscation is not a strong encryption of filenames, but hinders automated scanning tools picking up on filename patterns. It is an intermediate between "off" and "standard" which allows for longer path segment names.</p>
<p>There is a possibility with some unicode based filenames that the obfuscation is weak and may map lower case characters to upper case equivalents.</p>
<p>Obfuscation cannot be relied upon for strong protection.</p>
<ul>
<li>file names very lightly obfuscated</li>
<li>file names can be longer than standard encryption</li>
<li>can use sub paths and copy single files</li>
<li>directory structure visible</li>
<li>identical files names will have identical uploaded names</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloud storage systems have limits on file name length and total path length which rclone is more likely to breach using "Standard" file name encryption. Where file names are 143 or fewer characters in length issues should not be encountered, irrespective of cloud storage provider.</p>
<p>An experimental advanced option <code>filename_encoding</code> is now provided to address this problem to a certain degree. For cloud storage systems with case sensitive file names (e.g. Google Drive), <code>base64</code> can be used to reduce file name length. For cloud storage systems using UTF-16 to store file names internally (e.g. OneDrive, Dropbox, Box), <code>base32768</code> can be used to drastically reduce file name length.</p>
<p>An alternative, future rclone file name encryption mode may tolerate backend provider path length limits.</p>
<h3 id="directory-name-encryption">Directory name encryption</h3>
<p>Crypt offers the option of encrypting dir names or leaving them intact. There are two options:</p>
<p>True</p>
<p>Encrypts the whole file path including directory names Example: <code>1/12/123.txt</code> is encrypted to <code>p0e52nreeaj0a5ea7s64m4j72s/l42g6771hnv3an9cgc8cr2n1ng/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0</code></p>
<p>False</p>
<p>Only encrypts file names, skips directory names Example: <code>1/12/123.txt</code> is encrypted to <code>1/12/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0</code></p>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-4">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>Crypt stores modification times using the underlying remote so support depends on that.</p>
<p>Hashes are not stored for crypt. However the data integrity is protected by an extremely strong crypto authenticator.</p>
<p>Use the <code>rclone cryptcheck</code> command to check the integrity of an encrypted remote instead of <code>rclone check</code> which can't check the checksums properly.</p>

<h4 id="crypt-server-side-across-configs">--crypt-server-side-across-configs</h4>
<p>Deprecated: use --server-side-across-configs instead.</p>
<p>Allow server-side operations (e.g. copy) to work across different crypt configs.</p>
<p>Normally this option is not what you want, but if you have two crypts pointing to the same backend you can use it.</p>
<p>This can be used, for example, to change file name encryption type without re-uploading all the data. Just make two crypt backends pointing to two different directories with the single changed parameter and use rclone move to move the files between the crypt remotes.</p>

<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="crypt-show-mapping">--crypt-show-mapping</h4>
<p>For all files listed show how the names encrypt.</p>
<p>If this flag is set then for each file that the remote is asked to list, it will log (at level INFO) a line stating the decrypted file name and the encrypted file name.</p>
<p>This is so you can work out which encrypted names are which decrypted names just in case you need to do something with the encrypted file names, or for debugging purposes.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="crypt-pass-bad-blocks">--crypt-pass-bad-blocks</h4>
<p>If set this will pass bad blocks through as all 0.</p>
<p>This should not be set in normal operation, it should only be set if trying to recover an encrypted file with errors and it is desired to recover as much of the file as possible.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: pass_bad_blocks</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_PASS_BAD_BLOCKS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="crypt-strict-names">--crypt-strict-names</h4>
<p>If set, this will raise an error when crypt comes across a filename that can't be decrypted.</p>
<p>(By default, rclone will just log a NOTICE and continue as normal.) This can happen if encrypted and unencrypted files are stored in the same directory (which is not recommended.) It may also indicate a more serious problem that should be investigated.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: strict_names</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_STRICT_NAMES</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="crypt-filename-encoding">--crypt-filename-encoding</h4>
<p>How to encode the encrypted filename to text string.</p>
<p>This option could help with shortening the encrypted filename. The suitable option would depend on the way your remote count the filename length and if it's case sensitive.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: filename_encoding</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_FILENAME_ENCODING</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Default: "base32"</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>"base32"
<ul>
<li>Encode using base32. Suitable for all remote.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"base64"
<ul>
<li>Encode using base64. Suitable for case sensitive remote.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"base32768"
<ul>
<li>Encode using base32768. Suitable if your remote counts UTF-16 or</li>
<li>Unicode codepoint instead of UTF-8 byte length. (Eg. Onedrive, Dropbox)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="crypt-suffix">--crypt-suffix</h4>
<p>If this is set it will override the default suffix of ".bin".</p>
<p>Setting suffix to "none" will result in an empty suffix. This may be useful when the path length is critical.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: suffix</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_SUFFIX</li>
<li>Type: string</li>

<h2 id="backend-commands-3">Backend commands</h2>
<p>Here are the commands specific to the crypt backend.</p>
<p>Run them with</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend COMMAND remote:</code></pre>
<p>The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/">backend</a> command for more info on how to pass options and arguments.</p>
<p>These can be run on a running backend using the rc command <a href="https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command">backend/command</a>.</p>
<h3 id="encode">encode</h3>
<p>Encode the given filename(s)</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend encode remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This encodes the filenames given as arguments returning a list of strings of the encoded results.</p>
<p>Usage Example:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend encode crypt: file1 [file2...]
rclone rc backend/command command=encode fs=crypt: file1 [file2...]</code></pre>
<h3 id="decode">decode</h3>
<p>Decode the given filename(s)</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend decode remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This decodes the filenames given as arguments returning a list of strings of the decoded results. It will return an error if any of the inputs are invalid.</p>
<p>Usage Example:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend decode crypt: encryptedfile1 [encryptedfile2...]
rclone rc backend/command command=decode fs=crypt: encryptedfile1 [encryptedfile2...]</code></pre>
<h2 id="backing-up-an-encrypted-remote">Backing up an encrypted remote</h2>
<p>If you wish to backup an encrypted remote, it is recommended that you use <code>rclone sync</code> on the encrypted files, and make sure the passwords are the same in the new encrypted remote.</p>
<p>This will have the following advantages</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rclone sync</code> will check the checksums while copying</li>
<li>you can use <code>rclone check</code> between the encrypted remotes</li>
<li>you don't decrypt and encrypt unnecessarily</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let's say you have your original remote at <code>remote:</code> with the encrypted version at <code>eremote:</code> with path <code>remote:crypt</code>. You would then set up the new remote <code>remote2:</code> and then the encrypted version <code>eremote2:</code> with path <code>remote2:crypt</code> using the same passwords as <code>eremote:</code>.</p>
<p>To sync the two remotes you would do</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive remote:crypt remote2:crypt</code></pre>
<p>And to check the integrity you would do</p>

<h3 id="file-encryption">File encryption</h3>
<p>Files are encrypted 1:1 source file to destination object. The file has a header and is divided into chunks.</p>
<h4 id="header-1">Header</h4>
<ul>
<li>8 bytes magic string <code>RCLONE\x00\x00</code></li>
<li>24 bytes Nonce (IV)</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial nonce is generated from the operating systems crypto strong random number generator. The nonce is incremented for each chunk read making sure each nonce is unique for each block written. The chance of a nonce being reused is minuscule. If you wrote an exabyte of data (10¹⁸ bytes) you would have a probability of approximately 2×10⁻³² of reusing a nonce.</p>
<h4 id="chunk">Chunk</h4>
<p>Each chunk will contain 64 KiB of data, except for the last one which may have less data. The data chunk is in standard NaCl SecretBox format. SecretBox uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate messages.</p>
<p>Each chunk contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>16 Bytes of Poly1305 authenticator</li>
<li>1 - 65536 bytes XSalsa20 encrypted data</li>
</ul>
<p>64k chunk size was chosen as the best performing chunk size (the authenticator takes too much time below this and the performance drops off due to cache effects above this). Note that these chunks are buffered in memory so they can't be too big.</p>
<p>This uses a 32 byte (256 bit key) key derived from the user password.</p>
<h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>
<p>1 byte file will encrypt to</p>
<ul>
<li>32 bytes header</li>
<li>17 bytes data chunk</li>
</ul>
<p>49 bytes total</p>
<p>1 MiB (1048576 bytes) file will encrypt to</p>
<ul>
<li>32 bytes header</li>
<li>16 chunks of 65568 bytes</li>
</ul>
<p>1049120 bytes total (a 0.05% overhead). This is the overhead for big files.</p>
<h3 id="name-encryption">Name encryption</h3>
<p>File names are encrypted segment by segment - the path is broken up into <code>/</code> separated strings and these are encrypted individually.</p>
<p>File segments are padded using PKCS#7 to a multiple of 16 bytes before encryption.</p>
<p>They are then encrypted with EME using AES with 256 bit key. EME (ECB-Mix-ECB) is a wide-block encryption mode presented in the 2003 paper "A Parallelizable Enciphering Mode" by Halevi and Rogaway.</p>
<p>This makes for deterministic encryption which is what we want - the same filename must encrypt to the same thing otherwise we can't find it on the cloud storage system.</p>
<p>This means that</p>
<ul>
<li>filenames with the same name will encrypt the same</li>
<li>filenames which start the same won't have a common prefix</li>
</ul>
<p>This uses a 32 byte key (256 bits) and a 16 byte (128 bits) IV both of which are derived from the user password.</p>
<p>After encryption they are written out using a modified version of standard <code>base32</code> encoding as described in RFC4648. The standard encoding is modified in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>it becomes lower case (no-one likes upper case filenames!)</li>
<li>we strip the padding character <code>=</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>base32</code> is used rather than the more efficient <code>base64</code> so rclone can be used on case insensitive remotes (e.g. Windows, Box, Dropbox, Onedrive etc).</p>
<h3 id="key-derivation">Key derivation</h3>
<p>Rclone uses <code>scrypt</code> with parameters <code>N=16384, r=8, p=1</code> with an optional user supplied salt (password2) to derive the 32+32+16 = 80 bytes of key material required. If the user doesn't supply a salt then rclone uses an internal one.</p>
<p><code>scrypt</code> makes it impractical to mount a dictionary attack on rclone encrypted data. For full protection against this you should always use a salt.</p>

<h2 id="warning">Warning</h2>
<p>This remote is currently <strong>experimental</strong>. Things may break and data may be lost. Anything you do with this remote is at your own risk. Please understand the risks associated with using experimental code and don't use this remote in critical applications.</p>
<p>The <code>Compress</code> remote adds compression to another remote. It is best used with remotes containing many large compressible files.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-10">Configuration</h2>
<p>To use this remote, all you need to do is specify another remote and a compression mode to use:</p>
<pre><code>Current remotes:

<h3 id="compression-modes">Compression Modes</h3>
<p>Currently only gzip compression is supported. It provides a decent balance between speed and size and is well supported by other applications. Compression strength can further be configured via an advanced setting where 0 is no compression and 9 is strongest compression.</p>
<h3 id="file-types">File types</h3>
<p>If you open a remote wrapped by compress, you will see that there are many files with an extension corresponding to the compression algorithm you chose. These files are standard files that can be opened by various archive programs, but they have some hidden metadata that allows them to be used by rclone. While you may download and decompress these files at will, do <strong>not</strong> manually delete or rename files. Files without correct metadata files will not be recognized by rclone.</p>
<h3 id="file-names">File names</h3>
<p>The compressed files will be named <code>*.###########.gz</code> where <code>*</code> is the base file and the <code>#</code> part is base64 encoded size of the uncompressed file. The file names should not be changed by anything other than the rclone compression backend.</p>

<h4 id="compress-level">--compress-level</h4>
<p>GZIP compression level (-2 to 9).</p>
<p>Generally -1 (default, equivalent to 5) is recommended. Levels 1 to 9 increase compression at the cost of speed. Going past 6 generally offers very little return.</p>
<p>Level -2 uses Huffman encoding only. Only use if you know what you are doing. Level 0 turns off compression.</p>

<h4 id="compress-ram-cache-limit">--compress-ram-cache-limit</h4>
<p>Some remotes don't allow the upload of files with unknown size. In this case the compressed file will need to be cached to determine it's size.</p>
<p>Files smaller than this limit will be cached in RAM, files larger than this limit will be cached on disk.</p>

<p>Any metadata supported by the underlying remote is read and written.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata">metadata</a> docs for more info.</p>
<h1 id="combine">Combine</h1>
<p>The <code>combine</code> backend joins remotes together into a single directory tree.</p>
<p>For example you might have a remote for images on one provider:</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone tree s3:imagesbucket
/
├── image1.jpg
└── image2.jpg</code></pre>
<p>And a remote for files on another:</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone tree drive:important/files
/
├── file1.txt
└── file2.txt</code></pre>
<p>The <code>combine</code> backend can join these together into a synthetic directory structure like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone tree combined:
/
├── files
│   ├── file1.txt
│   └── file2.txt
└── images
    ├── image1.jpg
    └── image2.jpg</code></pre>
<p>You'd do this by specifying an <code>upstreams</code> parameter in the config like this</p>
<pre><code>upstreams = images=s3:imagesbucket files=drive:important/files</code></pre>
<p>During the initial setup with <code>rclone config</code> you will specify the upstreams remotes as a space separated list. The upstream remotes can either be a local paths or other remotes.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-11">Configuration</h2>
<p>Here is an example of how to make a combine called <code>remote</code> for the example above. First run:</p>

<h3 id="configuring-for-google-drive-shared-drives">Configuring for Google Drive Shared Drives</h3>
<p>Rclone has a convenience feature for making a combine backend for all the shared drives you have access to.</p>
<p>Assuming your main (non shared drive) Google drive remote is called <code>drive:</code> you would run</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend -o config drives drive:</code></pre>
<p>This would produce something like this:</p>
<pre><code>[My Drive]
type = alias
remote = drive,team_drive=0ABCDEF-01234567890,root_folder_id=:

[Test Drive]
type = alias
remote = drive,team_drive=0ABCDEFabcdefghijkl,root_folder_id=:

[AllDrives]
type = combine
upstreams = &quot;My Drive=My Drive:&quot; &quot;Test Drive=Test Drive:&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If you then add that config to your config file (find it with <code>rclone config file</code>) then you can access all the shared drives in one place with the <code>AllDrives:</code> remote.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/remote_setup/">remote setup docs</a> for how to set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.</p>
<p>Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the token as returned from Dropbox. This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is on <code>http://127.0.0.1:53682/</code> and it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall, or use manual mode.</p>
<p>You can then use it like this,</p>
<p>List directories in top level of your dropbox</p>

<h3 id="dropbox-for-business">Dropbox for business</h3>
<p>Rclone supports Dropbox for business and Team Folders.</p>
<p>When using Dropbox for business <code>remote:</code> and <code>remote:path/to/file</code> will refer to your personal folder.</p>
<p>If you wish to see Team Folders you must use a leading <code>/</code> in the path, so <code>rclone lsd remote:/</code> will refer to the root and show you all Team Folders and your User Folder.</p>
<p>You can then use team folders like this <code>remote:/TeamFolder</code> and <code>remote:/TeamFolder/path/to/file</code>.</p>
<p>A leading <code>/</code> for a Dropbox personal account will do nothing, but it will take an extra HTTP transaction so it should be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-5">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>Dropbox supports modified times, but the only way to set a modification time is to re-upload the file.</p>
<p>This means that if you uploaded your data with an older version of rclone which didn't support the v2 API and modified times, rclone will decide to upload all your old data to fix the modification times. If you don't want this to happen use <code>--size-only</code> or <code>--checksum</code> flag to stop it.</p>
<p>Dropbox supports <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/content-hash">its own hash type</a> which is checked for all transfers.</p>

<h3 id="batch-mode">Batch mode uploads</h3>
<p>Using batch mode uploads is very important for performance when using the Dropbox API. See <a href="https://developers.dropbox.com/dbx-performance-guide">the dropbox performance guide</a> for more info.</p>
<p>There are 3 modes rclone can use for uploads.</p>
<h4 id="dropbox-batch-mode-off">--dropbox-batch-mode off</h4>
<p>In this mode rclone will not use upload batching. This was the default before rclone v1.55. It has the disadvantage that it is very likely to encounter <code>too_many_requests</code> errors like this</p>
<pre><code>NOTICE: too_many_requests/.: Too many requests or write operations. Trying again in 15 seconds.</code></pre>
<p>When rclone receives these it has to wait for 15s or sometimes 300s before continuing which really slows down transfers.</p>
<p>This will happen especially if <code>--transfers</code> is large, so this mode isn't recommended except for compatibility or investigating problems.</p>
<h4 id="dropbox-batch-mode-sync">--dropbox-batch-mode sync</h4>
<p>In this mode rclone will batch up uploads to the size specified by <code>--dropbox-batch-size</code> and commit them together.</p>
<p>Using this mode means you can use a much higher <code>--transfers</code> parameter (32 or 64 works fine) without receiving <code>too_many_requests</code> errors.</p>
<p>This mode ensures full data integrity.</p>
<p>Note that there may be a pause when quitting rclone while rclone finishes up the last batch using this mode.</p>
<h4 id="dropbox-batch-mode-async">--dropbox-batch-mode async</h4>
<p>In this mode rclone will batch up uploads to the size specified by <code>--dropbox-batch-size</code> and commit them together.</p>
<p>However it will not wait for the status of the batch to be returned to the caller. This means rclone can use a much bigger batch size (much bigger than <code>--transfers</code>), at the cost of not being able to check the status of the upload.</p>
<p>This provides the maximum possible upload speed especially with lots of small files, however rclone can't check the file got uploaded properly using this mode.</p>
<p>If you are using this mode then using "rclone check" after the transfer completes is recommended. Or you could do an initial transfer with <code>--dropbox-batch-mode async</code> then do a final transfer with <code>--dropbox-batch-mode sync</code> (the default).</p>
<p>Note that there may be a pause when quitting rclone while rclone finishes up the last batch using this mode.</p>
<h3 id="exporting-files">Exporting files</h3>
<p>Certain files in Dropbox are "exportable", such as Dropbox Paper documents. These files need to be converted to another format in order to be downloaded. Often multiple formats are available for conversion.</p>
<p>When rclone downloads a exportable file, it chooses the format to download based on the <code>--dropbox-export-formats</code> setting. By default, the export formats are <code>html,md</code>, which are sensible defaults for Dropbox Paper.</p>
<p>Rclone chooses the first format ID in the export formats list that Dropbox supports for a given file. If no format in the list is usable, rclone will choose the default format that Dropbox suggests.</p>
<p>Rclone will change the extension to correspond to the export format. Here are some examples of how extensions are mapped:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>File type</th>
<th>Filename in Dropbox</th>
<th>Filename in rclone</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Paper</td>
<td>mydoc.paper</td>
<td>mydoc.html</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Paper template</td>
<td>mydoc.papert</td>
<td>mydoc.papert.html</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>other</td>
<td>mydoc</td>
<td>mydoc.html</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><em>Importing</em> exportable files is not yet supported by rclone.</p>
<p>Here are the supported export extensions known by rclone. Note that rclone does not currently support other formats not on this list, even if Dropbox supports them. Also, Dropbox could change the list of supported formats at any time.</p>

<li>Config: auth_url</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_AUTH_URL</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>

<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropbox-client-credentials">--dropbox-client-credentials</h4>
<p>Use client credentials OAuth flow.</p>
<p>This will use the OAUTH2 client Credentials Flow as described in RFC 6749.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: client_credentials</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropbox-chunk-size">--dropbox-chunk-size</h4>
<p>Upload chunk size (&lt; 150Mi).</p>
<p>Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of this size.</p>
<p>Note that chunks are buffered in memory (one at a time) so rclone can deal with retries. Setting this larger will increase the speed slightly (at most 10% for 128 MiB in tests) at the cost of using more memory. It can be set smaller if you are tight on memory.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: chunk_size</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_CHUNK_SIZE</li>
<li>Type: SizeSuffix</li>
<li>Default: 48Mi</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropbox-impersonate">--dropbox-impersonate</h4>
<p>Impersonate this user when using a business account.</p>
<p>Note that if you want to use impersonate, you should make sure this flag is set when running "rclone config" as this will cause rclone to request the "members.read" scope which it won't normally. This is needed to lookup a members email address into the internal ID that dropbox uses in the API.</p>
<p>Using the "members.read" scope will require a Dropbox Team Admin to approve during the OAuth flow.</p>
<p>You will have to use your own App (setting your own client_id and client_secret) to use this option as currently rclone's default set of permissions doesn't include "members.read". This can be added once v1.55 or later is in use everywhere.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: impersonate</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_IMPERSONATE</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropbox-shared-files">--dropbox-shared-files</h4>
<p>Instructs rclone to work on individual shared files.</p>
<p>In this mode rclone's features are extremely limited - only list (ls, lsl, etc.) operations and read operations (e.g. downloading) are supported in this mode. All other operations will be disabled.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: shared_files</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_SHARED_FILES</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropbox-shared-folders">--dropbox-shared-folders</h4>
<p>Instructs rclone to work on shared folders.</p>
<p>When this flag is used with no path only the List operation is supported and all available shared folders will be listed. If you specify a path the first part will be interpreted as the name of shared folder. Rclone will then try to mount this shared to the root namespace. On success shared folder rclone proceeds normally. The shared folder is now pretty much a normal folder and all normal operations are supported.</p>
<p>Note that we don't unmount the shared folder afterwards so the --dropbox-shared-folders can be omitted after the first use of a particular shared folder.</p>
<p>See also --dropbox-root-namespace for an alternative way to work with shared folders.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: shared_folders</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_SHARED_FOLDERS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropbox-pacer-min-sleep">--dropbox-pacer-min-sleep</h4>
<p>Minimum time to sleep between API calls.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>

<li>Type: Encoding</li>
<li>Default: Slash,BackSlash,Del,RightSpace,InvalidUtf8,Dot</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropbox-root-namespace">--dropbox-root-namespace</h4>
<p>Specify a different Dropbox namespace ID to use as the root for all paths.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: root_namespace</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_ROOT_NAMESPACE</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropbox-export-formats">--dropbox-export-formats</h4>
<p>Comma separated list of preferred formats for exporting files</p>
<p>Certain Dropbox files can only be accessed by exporting them to another format. These include Dropbox Paper documents.</p>
<p>For each such file, rclone will choose the first format on this list that Dropbox considers valid. If none is valid, it will choose Dropbox's default format.</p>
<p>Known formats include: "html", "md" (markdown)</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: export_formats</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_EXPORT_FORMATS</li>
<li>Type: CommaSepList</li>
<li>Default: html,md</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropbox-skip-exports">--dropbox-skip-exports</h4>
<p>Skip exportable files in all listings.</p>
<p>If given, exportable files practically become invisible to rclone.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: skip_exports</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_SKIP_EXPORTS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropbox-show-all-exports">--dropbox-show-all-exports</h4>
<p>Show all exportable files in listings.</p>
<p>Adding this flag will allow all exportable files to be server side copied. Note that rclone doesn't add extensions to the exportable file names in this mode.</p>
<p>Do <strong>not</strong> use this flag when trying to download exportable files - rclone will fail to download them.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: show_all_exports</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_SHOW_ALL_EXPORTS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropbox-batch-mode">--dropbox-batch-mode</h4>
<p>Upload file batching sync|async|off.</p>
<p>This sets the batch mode used by rclone.</p>
<p>For full info see <a href="https://rclone.org/dropbox/#batch-mode">the main docs</a></p>
<p>This has 3 possible values</p>
<ul>
<li>off - no batching</li>
<li>sync - batch uploads and check completion (default)</li>
<li>async - batch upload and don't check completion</li>
</ul>
<p>Rclone will close any outstanding batches when it exits which may make a delay on quit.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: batch_mode</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_MODE</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Default: "sync"</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropbox-batch-size">--dropbox-batch-size</h4>
<p>Max number of files in upload batch.</p>
<p>This sets the batch size of files to upload. It has to be less than 1000.</p>
<p>By default this is 0 which means rclone will calculate the batch size depending on the setting of batch_mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>batch_mode: async - default batch_size is 100</li>
<li>batch_mode: sync - default batch_size is the same as --transfers</li>
<li>batch_mode: off - not in use</li>
</ul>
<p>Rclone will close any outstanding batches when it exits which may make a delay on quit.</p>
<p>Setting this is a great idea if you are uploading lots of small files as it will make them a lot quicker. You can use --transfers 32 to maximise throughput.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: batch_size</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_SIZE</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 0</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropbox-batch-timeout">--dropbox-batch-timeout</h4>
<p>Max time to allow an idle upload batch before uploading.</p>
<p>If an upload batch is idle for more than this long then it will be uploaded.</p>
<p>The default for this is 0 which means rclone will choose a sensible default based on the batch_mode in use.</p>
<ul>
<li>batch_mode: async - default batch_timeout is 10s</li>
<li>batch_mode: sync - default batch_timeout is 500ms</li>
<li>batch_mode: off - not in use</li>
</ul>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: batch_timeout</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_TIMEOUT</li>
<li>Type: Duration</li>
<li>Default: 0s</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropbox-batch-commit-timeout">--dropbox-batch-commit-timeout</h4>
<p>Max time to wait for a batch to finish committing. (no longer used)</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: batch_commit_timeout</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_COMMIT_TIMEOUT</li>
<li>Type: Duration</li>
<li>Default: 10m0s</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropbox-description">--dropbox-description</h4>
<p>Description of the remote.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: description</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_DESCRIPTION</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limitations-10">Limitations</h2>
<p>Note that Dropbox is case insensitive so you can't have a file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".</p>
<p>There are some file names such as <code>thumbs.db</code> which Dropbox can't store. There is a full list of them in the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/145">"Ignored Files" section of this document</a>. Rclone will issue an error message <code>File name disallowed - not uploading</code> if it attempts to upload one of those file names, but the sync won't fail.</p>
<p>Some errors may occur if you try to sync copyright-protected files because Dropbox has its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/30/how-dropbox-knows-when-youre-sharing-copyrighted-stuff-without-actually-looking-at-your-stuff/">copyright detector</a> that prevents this sort of file being downloaded. This will return the error <code>ERROR : /path/to/your/file: Failed to copy: failed to open source object: path/restricted_content/.</code></p>
<p>If you have more than 10,000 files in a directory then <code>rclone purge dropbox:dir</code> will return the error <code>Failed to purge: There are too many files involved in this operation</code>. As a work-around do an <code>rclone delete dropbox:dir</code> followed by an <code>rclone rmdir dropbox:dir</code>.</p>
<p>When using <code>rclone link</code> you'll need to set <code>--expire</code> if using a non-personal account otherwise the visibility may not be correct. (Note that <code>--expire</code> isn't supported on personal accounts). See the <a href="https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-link-dropbox-permissions/23211">forum discussion</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-go-unofficial/issues/75">dropbox SDK issue</a>.</p>
<p>Modification times for Dropbox Paper documents are not exact, and may not change for some period after the document is edited. To make sure you get recent changes in a sync, either wait an hour or so, or use <code>--ignore-times</code> to force a full sync.</p>
<h2 id="get-your-own-dropbox-app-id">Get your own Dropbox App ID</h2>
<p>When you use rclone with Dropbox in its default configuration you are using rclone's App ID. This is shared between all the rclone users.</p>
<p>Here is how to create your own Dropbox App ID for rclone:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Log into the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create">Dropbox App console</a> with your Dropbox Account (It need not to be the same account as the Dropbox you want to access)</p></li>
<li><p>Choose an API =&gt; Usually this should be <code>Dropbox API</code></p></li>
<li><p>Choose the type of access you want to use =&gt; <code>Full Dropbox</code> or <code>App Folder</code>. If you want to use Team Folders, <code>Full Dropbox</code> is required (<a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-API-Support-Feedback/How-to-create-team-folder-inside-my-app-s-folder/m-p/601005/highlight/true#M27911">see here</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Name your App. The app name is global, so you can't use <code>rclone</code> for example</p></li>
<li><p>Click the button <code>Create App</code></p></li>
<li><p>Switch to the <code>Permissions</code> tab. Enable at least the following permissions: <code>account_info.read</code>, <code>files.metadata.write</code>, <code>files.content.write</code>, <code>files.content.read</code>, <code>sharing.write</code>. The <code>files.metadata.read</code> and <code>sharing.read</code> checkboxes will be marked too. Click <code>Submit</code></p></li>
<li><p>Switch to the <code>Settings</code> tab. Fill <code>OAuth2 - Redirect URIs</code> as <code>http://localhost:53682/</code> and click on <code>Add</code></p></li>
<li><p>Find the <code>App key</code> and <code>App secret</code> values on the <code>Settings</code> tab. Use these values in rclone config to add a new remote or edit an existing remote. The <code>App key</code> setting corresponds to <code>client_id</code> in rclone config, the <code>App secret</code> corresponds to <code>client_secret</code></p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="enterprise-file-fabric">Enterprise File Fabric</h1>

<p>Once configured you can then use <code>rclone</code> like this,</p>
<p>List directories in top level of your Enterprise File Fabric</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:</code></pre>
<p>List all the files in your Enterprise File Fabric</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:</code></pre>
<p>To copy a local directory to an Enterprise File Fabric directory called backup</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy /home/source remote:backup</code></pre>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-6">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>The Enterprise File Fabric allows modification times to be set on files accurate to 1 second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.</p>
<p>The Enterprise File Fabric does not support any data hashes at this time.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-filename-characters-6">Restricted filename characters</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters">default restricted characters set</a> will be replaced.</p>
<p>Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8">replaced</a>, as they can't be used in JSON strings.</p>
<h3 id="empty-files">Empty files</h3>
<p>Empty files aren't supported by the Enterprise File Fabric. Rclone will therefore upload an empty file as a single space with a mime type of <code>application/vnd.rclone.empty.file</code> and files with that mime type are treated as empty.</p>
<h3 id="root-folder-id-1">Root folder ID</h3>
<p>You can set the <code>root_folder_id</code> for rclone. This is the directory (identified by its <code>Folder ID</code>) that rclone considers to be the root of your Enterprise File Fabric.</p>
<p>Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct root to use itself.</p>
<p>However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder hierarchy.</p>
<p>In order to do this you will have to find the <code>Folder ID</code> of the directory you wish rclone to display. These aren't displayed in the web interface, but you can use <code>rclone lsf</code> to find them, for example</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone lsf --dirs-only -Fip --csv filefabric:
120673758,Burnt PDFs/
120673759,My Quick Uploads/
120673755,My Syncs/
120673756,My backups/
120673757,My contacts/
120673761,S3 Storage/</code></pre>
<p>The ID for "S3 Storage" would be <code>120673761</code>.</p>

<h3 id="paths-1">Paths</h3>
<p>A path without an initial <code>/</code> will operate in the <code>Rclone</code> directory.</p>
<p>A path with an initial <code>/</code> will operate at the root where you can see the <code>Rclone</code> directory.</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone lsf TestFileLu:/
CCTV/
Camera/
Documents/
Music/
Photos/
Rclone/
Vault/
Videos/</code></pre>
<h3 id="example-commands">Example Commands</h3>
<p>Create a new folder named <code>foldername</code> in the <code>Rclone</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code>rclone mkdir filelu:foldername</code></pre>
<p>Delete a folder on FileLu:</p>
<pre><code>rclone rmdir filelu:/folder/path/</code></pre>
<p>Delete a file on FileLu:</p>
<pre><code>rclone delete filelu:/hello.txt</code></pre>
<p>List files from your FileLu account:</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls filelu:</code></pre>
<p>List all folders:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd filelu:</code></pre>
<p>Copy a specific file to the FileLu root:</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy D:\\hello.txt filelu:</code></pre>
<p>Copy files from a local directory to a FileLu directory:</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy D:/local-folder filelu:/remote-folder/path/</code></pre>
<p>Download a file from FileLu into a local directory:</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy filelu:/file-path/hello.txt D:/local-folder</code></pre>
<p>Move files from a local directory to a FileLu directory:</p>
<pre><code>rclone move D:\\local-folder filelu:/remote-path/</code></pre>
<p>Sync files from a local directory to a FileLu directory:</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive D:/local-folder filelu:/remote-path/</code></pre>
<p>Mount remote to local Linux:</p>
<pre><code>rclone mount filelu: /root/mnt --vfs-cache-mode full</code></pre>
<p>Mount remote to local Windows:</p>
<pre><code>rclone mount filelu: D:/local_mnt --vfs-cache-mode full</code></pre>
<p>Get storage info about the FileLu account:</p>
<pre><code>rclone about filelu:</code></pre>
<p>All the other rclone commands are supported by this backend.</p>
<h3 id="folderid-instead-of-folder-path">FolderID instead of folder path</h3>
<p>We use the FolderID instead of the folder name to prevent errors when users have identical folder names or paths. For example, if a user has two or three folders named "test_folders," the system may become confused and won't know which folder to move. In large storage systems, some clients have hundred of thousands of folders and a few millions of files, duplicate folder names or paths are quite common.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-7">Modification Times and Hashes</h3>
<p>FileLu supports both modification times and MD5 hashes.</p>
<p>FileLu only supports filenames and folder names up to 255 characters in length, where a character is a Unicode character.</p>
<h3 id="duplicated-files-1">Duplicated Files</h3>
<p>When uploading and syncing via Rclone, FileLu does not allow uploading duplicate files within the same directory. However, you can upload duplicate files, provided they are in different directories (folders).</p>
<h3 id="failure-to-log-invalid-credentials-or-key">Failure to Log / Invalid Credentials or KEY</h3>
<p>Ensure that you have the correct Rclone key, which can be found in <a href="https://filelu.com/account/">My Account</a>. Every time you toggle Rclone OFF and ON in My Account, a new RC_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx key is generated. Be sure to update your Rclone configuration with the new key.</p>
<p>If you are connecting to your FileLu remote for the first time and encounter an error such as:</p>
<pre><code>Failed to create file system for &quot;my-filelu-remote:&quot;: couldn&#39;t login: Invalid credentials</code></pre>
<p>Ensure your Rclone Key is correct.</p>
<h3 id="process-killed">Process <code>killed</code></h3>
<p>Accounts with large files or extensive metadata may experience significant memory usage during list/sync operations. Ensure the system running <code>rclone</code> has sufficient memory and CPU to handle these operations.</p>

<h3 id="anonymous-ftp">Anonymous FTP</h3>
<p>When connecting to a FTP server that allows anonymous login, you can use the special "anonymous" username. Traditionally, this user account accepts any string as a password, although it is common to use either the password "anonymous" or "guest". Some servers require the use of a valid e-mail address as password.</p>
<p>Using <a href="#backend-path-to-dir">on-the-fly</a> or <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#connection-strings">connection string</a> remotes makes it easy to access such servers, without requiring any configuration in advance. The following are examples of that:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf :ftp: --ftp-host=speedtest.tele2.net --ftp-user=anonymous --ftp-pass=$(rclone obscure dummy)
rclone lsf :ftp,host=speedtest.tele2.net,user=anonymous,pass=$(rclone obscure dummy):</code></pre>
<p>The above examples work in Linux shells and in PowerShell, but not Windows Command Prompt. They execute the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/">rclone obscure</a> command to create a password string in the format required by the <a href="#ftp-pass">pass</a> option. The following examples are exactly the same, except use an already obscured string representation of the same password "dummy", and therefore works even in Windows Command Prompt:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf :ftp: --ftp-host=speedtest.tele2.net --ftp-user=anonymous --ftp-pass=IXs2wc8OJOz7SYLBk47Ji1rHTmxM
rclone lsf :ftp,host=speedtest.tele2.net,user=anonymous,pass=IXs2wc8OJOz7SYLBk47Ji1rHTmxM:</code></pre>
<h3 id="implicit-tls">Implicit TLS</h3>
<p>Rlone FTP supports implicit FTP over TLS servers (FTPS). This has to be enabled in the FTP backend config for the remote, or with <a href="#ftp-tls"><code>--ftp-tls</code></a>. The default FTPS port is <code>990</code>, not <code>21</code> and can be set with <a href="#ftp-port"><code>--ftp-port</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-filename-characters-7">Restricted filename characters</h3>
<p>In addition to the <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters">default restricted characters set</a> the following characters are also replaced:</p>
<p>File names cannot end with the following characters. Replacement is limited to the last character in a file name:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Character</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Value</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Replacement</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>SP</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">0x20</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">␠</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Not all FTP servers can have all characters in file names, for example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>FTP Server</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Forbidden characters</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<h3 id="standard-options-17">Standard options</h3>
<p>Here are the Standard options specific to ftp (FTP).</p>
<h4 id="ftp-host">--ftp-host</h4>
<p>FTP host to connect to.</p>
<p>E.g. "ftp.example.com".</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: host</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_FTP_HOST</li>
<li>Type: string</li>

<li>Env Var: RCLONE_FTP_USER</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Default: "$USER"</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ftp-port">--ftp-port</h4>
<p>FTP port number.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: port</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_FTP_PORT</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 21</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ftp-pass">--ftp-pass</h4>
<p>FTP password.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> Input to this must be obscured - see <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/">rclone obscure</a>.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: pass</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_FTP_PASS</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ftp-tls">--ftp-tls</h4>
<p>Use Implicit FTPS (FTP over TLS).</p>
<p>When using implicit FTP over TLS the client connects using TLS right from the start which breaks compatibility with non-TLS-aware servers. This is usually served over port 990 rather than port 21. Cannot be used in combination with explicit FTPS.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: tls</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_FTP_TLS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ftp-explicit-tls">--ftp-explicit-tls</h4>
<p>Use Explicit FTPS (FTP over TLS).</p>
<p>When using explicit FTP over TLS the client explicitly requests security from the server in order to upgrade a plain text connection to an encrypted one. Cannot be used in combination with implicit FTPS.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: explicit_tls</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_FTP_EXPLICIT_TLS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>

<h3 id="advanced-options-17">Advanced options</h3>
<p>Here are the Advanced options specific to ftp (FTP).</p>
<h4 id="ftp-concurrency">--ftp-concurrency</h4>
<p>Maximum number of FTP simultaneous connections, 0 for unlimited.</p>
<p>Note that setting this is very likely to cause deadlocks so it should be used with care.</p>
<p>If you are doing a sync or copy then make sure concurrency is one more than the sum of <code>--transfers</code> and <code>--checkers</code>.</p>
<p>If you use <code>--check-first</code> then it just needs to be one more than the maximum of <code>--checkers</code> and <code>--transfers</code>.</p>
<p>So for <code>concurrency 3</code> you'd use <code>--checkers 2 --transfers 2 --check-first</code> or <code>--checkers 1 --transfers 1</code>.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: concurrency</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_FTP_CONCURRENCY</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 0</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ftp-no-check-certificate">--ftp-no-check-certificate</h4>
<p>Do not verify the TLS certificate of the server.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: no_check_certificate</li>

<h2 id="limitations-12">Limitations</h2>
<p>FTP servers acting as rclone remotes must support <code>passive</code> mode. The mode cannot be configured as <code>passive</code> is the only supported one. Rclone's FTP implementation is not compatible with <code>active</code> mode as <a href="https://github.com/jlaffaye/ftp/issues/29">the library it uses doesn't support it</a>. This will likely never be supported due to security concerns.</p>
<p>Rclone's FTP backend does not support any checksums but can compare file sizes.</p>
<p><code>rclone about</code> is not supported by the FTP backend. Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy <code>mfs</code> (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">List of backends that do not support rclone about</a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/">rclone about</a></p>
<p>The implementation of : <code>--dump headers</code>, <code>--dump bodies</code>, <code>--dump auth</code> for debugging isn't the same as for rclone HTTP based backends - it has less fine grained control.</p>
<p><code>--timeout</code> isn't supported (but <code>--contimeout</code> is).</p>
<p><code>--bind</code> isn't supported.</p>
<p>Rclone's FTP backend could support server-side move but does not at present.</p>
<p>The <code>ftp_proxy</code> environment variable is not currently supported.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-4">Modification times</h3>
<p>File modification time (timestamps) is supported to 1 second resolution for major FTP servers: ProFTPd, PureFTPd, VsFTPd, and FileZilla FTP server. The <code>VsFTPd</code> server has non-standard implementation of time related protocol commands and needs a special configuration setting: <code>writing_mdtm = true</code>.</p>
<p>Support for precise file time with other FTP servers varies depending on what protocol extensions they advertise. If all the <code>MLSD</code>, <code>MDTM</code> and <code>MFTM</code> extensions are present, rclone will use them together to provide precise time. Otherwise the times you see on the FTP server through rclone are those of the last file upload.</p>
<p>You can use the following command to check whether rclone can use precise time with your FTP server: <code>rclone backend features your_ftp_remote:</code> (the trailing colon is important). Look for the number in the line tagged by <code>Precision</code> designating the remote time precision expressed as nanoseconds. A value of <code>1000000000</code> means that file time precision of 1 second is available. A value of <code>3153600000000000000</code> (or another large number) means "unsupported".</p>
<h1 id="gofile">Gofile</h1>
<p><a href="https://gofile.io">Gofile</a> is a content storage and distribution platform. Its aim is to provide as much service as possible for free or at a very low price.</p>
<p>The initial setup for Gofile involves logging in to the web interface and going to the "My Profile" section. Copy the "Account API token" for use in the config file.</p>
<p>Note that if you wish to connect rclone to Gofile you will need a premium account.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-18">Configuration</h2>
<p>Here is an example of how to make a remote called <code>remote</code>. First run:</p>
<pre><code> rclone config</code></pre>
<p>This will guide you through an interactive setup process:</p>
<pre><code>No remotes found, make a new one?

<p>Once configured you can then use <code>rclone</code> like this,</p>
<p>List directories and files in the top level of your Gofile</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf remote:</code></pre>
<p>To copy a local directory to an Gofile directory called backup</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy /home/source remote:backup</code></pre>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-8">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>Gofile supports modification times with a resolution of 1 second.</p>
<p>Gofile supports MD5 hashes, so you can use the <code>--checksum</code> flag.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-filename-characters-8">Restricted filename characters</h3>
<p>In addition to the <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters">default restricted characters set</a> the following characters are also replaced:</p>

<h3 id="public-links">Public Links</h3>
<p>Gofile supports <code>rclone link</code> to make public links to files or directories. If you specify a directory it will download as a <code>zip</code> file. You can use the <code>--expire</code> flag to specify the time the link should be valid. Note that <code>rclone link --unlink</code> removes all the public links for a file.</p>
<h3 id="root-folder-id-2">Root folder ID</h3>
<p>You can set the <code>root_folder_id</code> for rclone. This is the directory (identified by its <code>Folder ID</code>) that rclone considers to be the root of your Gofile drive.</p>
<p>Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct root to use itself and fill in the value in the config file.</p>
<p>However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder hierarchy.</p>
<p>In order to do this you will have to find the <code>Folder ID</code> of the directory you wish rclone to display.</p>
<p>You can do this with rclone</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone lsf -Fip --dirs-only remote:
d6341f53-ee65-4f29-9f59-d11e8070b2a0;Files/

<p>The ID to use is the part before the <code>;</code> so you could set</p>
<pre><code>root_folder_id = d6341f53-ee65-4f29-9f59-d11e8070b2a0</code></pre>

<h2 id="limitations-13">Limitations</h2>
<p>Gofile only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length, where a character is a unicode character.</p>
<p>Directories should not be cached for more than 24h otherwise files in the directory may not be downloadable. In practice this means when using a VFS based rclone command such as <code>rclone mount</code> you should make sure <code>--dir-cache-time</code> is less than <code>24h</code>.</p>
<p>Note that Gofile is currently limited to a total of 100,000 items. If you attempt to upload more than that you will get <code>error-limit-100000</code>. This limit may be lifted in the future.</p>
<h3 id="duplicated-files-2">Duplicated files</h3>
<p>Gofile is capable of having files with duplicated file names. For instance two files called <code>hello.txt</code> in the same directory.</p>
<p>Rclone cannot sync that to a normal file system but it can be fixed with the <code>rclone dedupe</code> command.</p>
<p>Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see messages in the log about duplicates.</p>
<p>Use <code>rclone dedupe</code> to fix duplicated files.</p>
<h1 id="google-cloud-storage-1">Google Cloud Storage</h1>
<p>Paths are specified as <code>remote:bucket</code> (or <code>remote:</code> for the <code>lsd</code> command.) You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. <code>remote:bucket/path/to/dir</code>.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-19">Configuration</h2>

<p>Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the token as returned from Google if using web browser to automatically authenticate. This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is on <code>http://127.0.0.1:53682/</code> and this it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall, or use manual mode.</p>

<h3 id="service-account-support">Service Account support</h3>
<p>You can set up rclone with Google Cloud Storage in an unattended mode, i.e. not tied to a specific end-user Google account. This is useful when you want to synchronise files onto machines that don't have actively logged-in users, for example build machines.</p>
<p>To get credentials for Google Cloud Platform <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts">IAM Service Accounts</a>, please head to the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/permissions/serviceaccounts">Service Account</a> section of the Google Developer Console. Service Accounts behave just like normal <code>User</code> permissions in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control">Google Cloud Storage ACLs</a>, so you can limit their access (e.g. make them read only). After creating an account, a JSON file containing the Service Account's credentials will be downloaded onto your machines. These credentials are what rclone will use for authentication.</p>
<p>To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path to your Service Account credentials at the <code>service_account_file</code> prompt and rclone won't use the browser based authentication flow. If you'd rather stuff the contents of the credentials file into the rclone config file, you can set <code>service_account_credentials</code> with the actual contents of the file instead, or set the equivalent environment variable.</p>
<h3 id="service-account-authentication-with-access-tokens">Service Account Authentication with Access Tokens</h3>
<p>Another option for service account authentication is to use access tokens via <em>gcloud impersonate-service-account</em>. Access tokens protect security by avoiding the use of the JSON key file, which can be breached. They also bypass oauth login flow, which is simpler on remote VMs that lack a web browser.</p>
<p>If you already have a working service account, skip to step 3.</p>
<h4 id="create-a-service-account-using">1. Create a service account using</h4>
<pre><code>gcloud iam service-accounts create gcs-read-only </code></pre>
<p>You can re-use an existing service account as well (like the one created above)</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="anonymous-access-1">Anonymous Access</h3>
<p>For downloads of objects that permit public access you can configure rclone to use anonymous access by setting <code>anonymous</code> to <code>true</code>. With unauthorized access you can't write or create files but only read or list those buckets and objects that have public read access.</p>
<h3 id="application-default-credentials">Application Default Credentials</h3>
<p>If no other source of credentials is provided, rclone will fall back to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/common/auth#authenticating_with_application_default_credentials">Application Default Credentials</a> this is useful both when you already have configured authentication for your developer account, or in production when running on a google compute host. Note that if running in docker, you may need to run additional commands on your google compute machine - <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#gcloud_as_a_docker_credential_helper">see this page</a>.</p>
<p>Note that in the case application default credentials are used, there is no need to explicitly configure a project number.</p>
<h3 id="fast-list-2">--fast-list</h3>
<p>This remote supports <code>--fast-list</code> which allows you to use fewer transactions in exchange for more memory. See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list">rclone docs</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="custom-upload-headers">Custom upload headers</h3>
<p>You can set custom upload headers with the <code>--header-upload</code> flag. Google Cloud Storage supports the headers as described in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/WorkingWithObjectMetadata">working with metadata documentation</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Cache-Control</li>
<li>Content-Disposition</li>
<li>Content-Encoding</li>
<li>Content-Language</li>
<li>Content-Type</li>
<li>X-Goog-Storage-Class</li>
<li>X-Goog-Meta-</li>
</ul>
<p>Eg <code>--header-upload "Content-Type text/potato"</code></p>
<p>Note that the last of these is for setting custom metadata in the form <code>--header-upload "x-goog-meta-key: value"</code></p>
<h3 id="modification-times-5">Modification times</h3>
<p>Google Cloud Storage stores md5sum natively. Google's <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil">gsutil</a> tool stores modification time with one-second precision as <code>goog-reserved-file-mtime</code> in file metadata.</p>
<p>To ensure compatibility with gsutil, rclone stores modification time in 2 separate metadata entries. <code>mtime</code> uses RFC3339 format with one-nanosecond precision. <code>goog-reserved-file-mtime</code> uses Unix timestamp format with one-second precision. To get modification time from object metadata, rclone reads the metadata in the following order: <code>mtime</code>, <code>goog-reserved-file-mtime</code>, object updated time.</p>
<p>Note that rclone's default modify window is 1ns. Files uploaded by gsutil only contain timestamps with one-second precision. If you use rclone to sync files previously uploaded by gsutil, rclone will attempt to update modification time for all these files. To avoid these possibly unnecessary updates, use <code>--modify-window 1s</code>.</p>

<p>Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the token as returned from Google if using web browser to automatically authenticate. This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is on <code>http://127.0.0.1:53682/</code> and it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall, or use manual mode.</p>
<p>You can then use it like this,</p>
<p>List directories in top level of your drive</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:</code></pre>
<p>List all the files in your drive</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:</code></pre>
<p>To copy a local directory to a drive directory called backup</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy /home/source remote:backup</code></pre>
<h3 id="scopes">Scopes</h3>
<p>Rclone allows you to select which scope you would like for rclone to use. This changes what type of token is granted to rclone. <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/about-auth">The scopes are defined here</a>.</p>
<p>A comma-separated list is allowed e.g. <code>drive.readonly,drive.file</code>.</p>
<p>The scope are</p>
<h4 id="drive">drive</h4>
<p>This is the default scope and allows full access to all files, except for the Application Data Folder (see below).</p>
<p>Choose this one if you aren't sure.</p>
<h4 id="drive.readonly">drive.readonly</h4>
<p>This allows read only access to all files. Files may be listed and downloaded but not uploaded, renamed or deleted.</p>
<h4 id="drive.file">drive.file</h4>
<p>With this scope rclone can read/view/modify only those files and folders it creates.</p>
<p>So if you uploaded files to drive via the web interface (or any other means) they will not be visible to rclone.</p>
<p>This can be useful if you are using rclone to backup data and you want to be sure confidential data on your drive is not visible to rclone.</p>
<p>Files created with this scope are visible in the web interface.</p>
<h4 id="drive.appfolder">drive.appfolder</h4>
<p>This gives rclone its own private area to store files. Rclone will not be able to see any other files on your drive and you won't be able to see rclone's files from the web interface either.</p>
<h4 id="drive.metadata.readonly">drive.metadata.readonly</h4>
<p>This allows read only access to file names only. It does not allow rclone to download or upload data, or rename or delete files or directories.</p>
<h3 id="root-folder-id-3">Root folder ID</h3>
<p>This option has been moved to the advanced section. You can set the <code>root_folder_id</code> for rclone. This is the directory (identified by its <code>Folder ID</code>) that rclone considers to be the root of your drive.</p>
<p>Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct root to use itself.</p>
<p>However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder hierarchy or to access data within the "Computers" tab on the drive web interface (where files from Google's Backup and Sync desktop program go).</p>
<p>In order to do this you will have to find the <code>Folder ID</code> of the directory you wish rclone to display. This will be the last segment of the URL when you open the relevant folder in the drive web interface.</p>
<p>So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like <code>https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh</code> in the browser, then you use <code>1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh</code> as the <code>root_folder_id</code> in the config.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> folders under the "Computers" tab seem to be read only (drive gives a 500 error) when using rclone.</p>
<p>There doesn't appear to be an API to discover the folder IDs of the "Computers" tab - please contact us if you know otherwise!</p>
<p>Note also that rclone can't access any data under the "Backups" tab on the google drive web interface yet.</p>
<h3 id="service-account-support-1">Service Account support</h3>
<p>You can set up rclone with Google Drive in an unattended mode, i.e. not tied to a specific end-user Google account. This is useful when you want to synchronise files onto machines that don't have actively logged-in users, for example build machines.</p>
<p>To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path to your Service Account credentials at the <code>service_account_file</code> prompt during <code>rclone config</code> and rclone won't use the browser based authentication flow. If you'd rather stuff the contents of the credentials file into the rclone config file, you can set <code>service_account_credentials</code> with the actual contents of the file instead, or set the equivalent environment variable.</p>
<h4 id="use-case---google-workspace-account-and-individual-drive">Use case - Google Workspace account and individual Drive</h4>
<p>Let's say that you are the administrator of a Google Workspace. The goal is to read or write data on an individual's Drive account, who IS a member of the domain. We'll call the domain <strong>example.com</strong>, and the user <strong>foo@example.com</strong>.</p>
<p>There's a few steps we need to go through to accomplish this:</p>
<h5 id="create-a-service-account-for-example.com">1. Create a service account for example.com</h5>
<ul>
<li>To create a service account and obtain its credentials, go to the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Developer Console</a>.</li>
<li>You must have a project - create one if you don't and make sure you are on the selected project.</li>
<li>Then go to "IAM &amp; admin" -&gt; "Service Accounts".</li>
<li>Use the "Create Service Account" button. Fill in "Service account name" and "Service account ID" with something that identifies your client.</li>
<li>Select "Create And Continue". Step 2 and 3 are optional.</li>
<li>Click on the newly created service account</li>
<li>Click "Keys" and then "Add Key" and then "Create new key"</li>
<li>Choose type "JSON" and click create</li>
<li>This will download a small JSON file that rclone will use for authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you ever need to remove access, press the "Delete service account key" button.</p>
<h5 id="allowing-api-access-to-example.com-google-drive">2. Allowing API access to example.com Google Drive</h5>
<ul>
<li>Go to example.com's <a href="https://admin.google.com">Workspace Admin Console</a></li>
<li>Go into "Security" (or use the search bar)</li>
<li>Select "Access and data control" and then "API controls"</li>
<li>Click "Manage domain-wide delegation"</li>
<li>Click "Add new"</li>
<li>In the "Client ID" field enter the service account's "Client ID" - this can be found in the Developer Console under "IAM &amp; Admin" -&gt; "Service Accounts", then "View Client ID" for the newly created service account. It is a ~21 character numerical string.</li>
<li>In the next field, "OAuth Scopes", enter <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive</code> to grant read/write access to Google Drive specifically. You can also use <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly</code> for read only access.</li>
<li>Click "Authorise"</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="configure-rclone-assuming-a-new-install">3. Configure rclone, assuming a new install</h5>
<pre><code>rclone config

n/s/q&gt; n         # New
name&gt;gdrive      # Gdrive is an example name
Storage&gt;         # Type drive

y/n&gt;             # Auto config, n
</code></pre>
<h5 id="verify-that-its-working">4. Verify that it's working</h5>
<ul>
<li><code>rclone -v --drive-impersonate foo@example.com lsf gdrive:backup</code></li>
<li>The arguments do:
<ul>
<li><code>-v</code> - verbose logging</li>
<li><code>--drive-impersonate foo@example.com</code> - this is what does the magic, pretending to be user foo.</li>
<li><code>lsf</code> - list files in a parsing friendly way</li>
<li><code>gdrive:backup</code> - use the remote called gdrive, work in the folder named backup.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: in case you configured a specific root folder on gdrive and rclone is unable to access the contents of that folder when using <code>--drive-impersonate</code>, do this instead: - in the gdrive web interface, share your root folder with the user/email of the new Service Account you created/selected at step 1 - use rclone without specifying the <code>--drive-impersonate</code> option, like this: <code>rclone -v lsf gdrive:backup</code></p>
<h3 id="shared-drives-team-drives">Shared drives (team drives)</h3>
<p>If you want to configure the remote to point to a Google Shared Drive (previously known as Team Drives) then answer <code>y</code> to the question <code>Configure this as a Shared Drive (Team Drive)?</code>.</p>
<p>This will fetch the list of Shared Drives from google and allow you to configure which one you want to use. You can also type in a Shared Drive ID if you prefer.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>Configure this as a Shared Drive (Team Drive)?
y) Yes
n) No
y/n&gt; y
Fetching Shared Drive list...
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value

 2 / Rclone Test 2
   \ &quot;yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy&quot;
 3 / Rclone Test 3
   \ &quot;zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz&quot;
Enter a Shared Drive ID&gt; 1
Configuration complete.

Keep this &quot;remote&quot; remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d&gt; y</code></pre>
<h3 id="fast-list-3">--fast-list</h3>
<p>This remote supports <code>--fast-list</code> which allows you to use fewer transactions in exchange for more memory. See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list">rclone docs</a> for more details.</p>
<p>It does this by combining multiple <code>list</code> calls into a single API request.</p>
<p>This works by combining many <code>'%s' in parents</code> filters into one expression. To list the contents of directories a, b and c, the following requests will be send by the regular <code>List</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>trashed=false and &#39;a&#39; in parents
trashed=false and &#39;b&#39; in parents
trashed=false and &#39;c&#39; in parents</code></pre>
<p>These can now be combined into a single request:</p>
<pre><code>trashed=false and (&#39;a&#39; in parents or &#39;b&#39; in parents or &#39;c&#39; in parents)</code></pre>
<p>The implementation of <code>ListR</code> will put up to 50 <code>parents</code> filters into one request. It will use the <code>--checkers</code> value to specify the number of requests to run in parallel.</p>
<p>In tests, these batch requests were up to 20x faster than the regular method. Running the following command against different sized folders gives:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsjson -vv -R --checkers=6 gdrive:folder</code></pre>
<p>small folder (220 directories, 700 files):</p>
<ul>
<li>without <code>--fast-list</code>: 38s</li>
<li>with <code>--fast-list</code>: 10s</li>
</ul>
<p>large folder (10600 directories, 39000 files):</p>
<ul>
<li>without <code>--fast-list</code>: 22:05 min</li>
<li>with <code>--fast-list</code>: 58s</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-9">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>Google drive stores modification times accurate to 1 ms.</p>
<p>Hash algorithms MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 are supported. Note, however, that a small fraction of files uploaded may not have SHA1 or SHA256 hashes especially if they were uploaded before 2018.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-filename-characters-10">Restricted filename characters</h3>
<p>Only Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8">replaced</a>, as they can't be used in JSON strings.</p>
<p>In contrast to other backends, <code>/</code> can also be used in names and <code>.</code> or <code>..</code> are valid names.</p>
<h3 id="revisions">Revisions</h3>
<p>Google drive stores revisions of files. When you upload a change to an existing file to google drive using rclone it will create a new revision of that file.</p>
<p>Revisions follow the standard google policy which at time of writing was</p>
<ul>
<li>They are deleted after 30 days or 100 revisions (whatever comes first).</li>
<li>They do not count towards a user storage quota.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deleting-files-1">Deleting files</h3>
<p>By default rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files. If deleting them permanently is required then use the <code>--drive-use-trash=false</code> flag, or set the equivalent environment variable.</p>
<h3 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h3>
<p>In March 2020 Google introduced a new feature in Google Drive called <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/9700156">drive shortcuts</a> (<a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/shortcuts">API</a>). These will (by September 2020) <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/simplifying-google-drives-folder-structure-and-sharing-models">replace the ability for files or folders to be in multiple folders at once</a>.</p>
<p>Shortcuts are files that link to other files on Google Drive somewhat like a symlink in unix, except they point to the underlying file data (e.g. the inode in unix terms) so they don't break if the source is renamed or moved about.</p>
<p>By default rclone treats these as follows.</p>
<p>For shortcuts pointing to files:</p>
<ul>
<li>When listing a file shortcut appears as the destination file.</li>
<li>When downloading the contents of the destination file is downloaded.</li>
<li>When updating shortcut file with a non shortcut file, the shortcut is removed then a new file is uploaded in place of the shortcut.</li>
<li>When server-side moving (renaming) the shortcut is renamed, not the destination file.</li>
<li>When server-side copying the shortcut is copied, not the contents of the shortcut. (unless <code>--drive-copy-shortcut-content</code> is in use in which case the contents of the shortcut gets copied).</li>
<li>When deleting the shortcut is deleted not the linked file.</li>
<li>When setting the modification time, the modification time of the linked file will be set.</li>
</ul>
<p>For shortcuts pointing to folders:</p>
<ul>
<li>When listing the shortcut appears as a folder and that folder will contain the contents of the linked folder appear (including any sub folders)</li>
<li>When downloading the contents of the linked folder and sub contents are downloaded</li>
<li>When uploading to a shortcut folder the file will be placed in the linked folder</li>
<li>When server-side moving (renaming) the shortcut is renamed, not the destination folder</li>
<li>When server-side copying the contents of the linked folder is copied, not the shortcut.</li>
<li>When deleting with <code>rclone rmdir</code> or <code>rclone purge</code> the shortcut is deleted not the linked folder.</li>
<li><strong>NB</strong> When deleting with <code>rclone remove</code> or <code>rclone mount</code> the contents of the linked folder will be deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/">rclone backend</a> command can be used to create shortcuts.</p>
<p>Shortcuts can be completely ignored with the <code>--drive-skip-shortcuts</code> flag or the corresponding <code>skip_shortcuts</code> configuration setting.</p>
<p>If you have shortcuts that lead to an infinite recursion in your drive (e.g. a shortcut pointing to a parent folder), <code>skip_shortcuts</code> might be mandatory to be able to copy the drive.</p>
<h3 id="emptying-trash">Emptying trash</h3>
<p>If you wish to empty your trash you can use the <code>rclone cleanup remote:</code> command which will permanently delete all your trashed files. This command does not take any path arguments.</p>
<p>Note that Google Drive takes some time (minutes to days) to empty the trash even though the command returns within a few seconds. No output is echoed, so there will be no confirmation even using -v or -vv.</p>
<h3 id="quota-information">Quota information</h3>
<p>To view your current quota you can use the <code>rclone about remote:</code> command which will display your usage limit (quota), the usage in Google Drive, the size of all files in the Trash and the space used by other Google services such as Gmail. This command does not take any path arguments.</p>
<h4 id="importexport-of-google-documents">Import/Export of google documents</h4>
<p>Google documents can be exported from and uploaded to Google Drive.</p>
<p>When rclone downloads a Google doc it chooses a format to download depending upon the <code>--drive-export-formats</code> setting. By default the export formats are <code>docx,xlsx,pptx,svg</code> which are a sensible default for an editable document.</p>
<p>When choosing a format, rclone runs down the list provided in order and chooses the first file format the doc can be exported as from the list. If the file can't be exported to a format on the formats list, then rclone will choose a format from the default list.</p>
<p>If you prefer an archive copy then you might use <code>--drive-export-formats pdf</code>, or if you prefer openoffice/libreoffice formats you might use <code>--drive-export-formats ods,odt,odp</code>.</p>
<p>Note that rclone adds the extension to the google doc, so if it is called <code>My Spreadsheet</code> on google docs, it will be exported as <code>My Spreadsheet.xlsx</code> or <code>My Spreadsheet.pdf</code> etc.</p>
<p>When importing files into Google Drive, rclone will convert all files with an extension in <code>--drive-import-formats</code> to their associated document type. rclone will not convert any files by default, since the conversion is lossy process.</p>
<p>The conversion must result in a file with the same extension when the <code>--drive-export-formats</code> rules are applied to the uploaded document.</p>
<p>Here are some examples for allowed and prohibited conversions.</p>
<table>

<p>This limitation can be disabled by specifying <code>--drive-allow-import-name-change</code>. When using this flag, rclone can convert multiple files types resulting in the same document type at once, e.g. with <code>--drive-import-formats docx,odt,txt</code>, all files having these extension would result in a document represented as a docx file. This brings the additional risk of overwriting a document, if multiple files have the same stem. Many rclone operations will not handle this name change in any way. They assume an equal name when copying files and might copy the file again or delete them when the name changes.</p>
<p>Here are the possible export extensions with their corresponding mime types. Most of these can also be used for importing, but there more that are not listed here. Some of these additional ones might only be available when the operating system provides the correct MIME type entries.</p>
<p>This list can be changed by Google Drive at any time and might not represent the currently available conversions.</p>

<h4 id="drive-use-created-date">--drive-use-created-date</h4>
<p>Use file created date instead of modified date.</p>
<p>Useful when downloading data and you want the creation date used in place of the last modified date.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: This flag may have some unexpected consequences.</p>
<p>When uploading to your drive all files will be overwritten unless they haven't been modified since their creation. And the inverse will occur while downloading. This side effect can be avoided by using the "--checksum" flag.</p>
<p>This feature was implemented to retain photos capture date as recorded by google photos. You will first need to check the "Create a Google Photos folder" option in your google drive settings. You can then copy or move the photos locally and use the date the image was taken (created) set as the modification date.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>

<h4 id="drive-chunk-size">--drive-chunk-size</h4>
<p>Upload chunk size.</p>
<p>Must a power of 2 &gt;= 256k.</p>
<p>Making this larger will improve performance, but note that each chunk is buffered in memory one per transfer.</p>
<p>Reducing this will reduce memory usage but decrease performance.</p>

<h4 id="drive-acknowledge-abuse">--drive-acknowledge-abuse</h4>
<p>Set to allow files which return cannotDownloadAbusiveFile to be downloaded.</p>
<p>If downloading a file returns the error "This file has been identified as malware or spam and cannot be downloaded" with the error code "cannotDownloadAbusiveFile" then supply this flag to rclone to indicate you acknowledge the risks of downloading the file and rclone will download it anyway.</p>
<p>Note that if you are using service account it will need Manager permission (not Content Manager) to for this flag to work. If the SA does not have the right permission, Google will just ignore the flag.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: acknowledge_abuse</li>

<h4 id="drive-size-as-quota">--drive-size-as-quota</h4>
<p>Show sizes as storage quota usage, not actual size.</p>
<p>Show the size of a file as the storage quota used. This is the current version plus any older versions that have been set to keep forever.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: This flag may have some unexpected consequences.</p>
<p>It is not recommended to set this flag in your config - the recommended usage is using the flag form --drive-size-as-quota when doing rclone ls/lsl/lsf/lsjson/etc only.</p>
<p>If you do use this flag for syncing (not recommended) then you will need to use --ignore size also.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>

<h4 id="drive-server-side-across-configs">--drive-server-side-across-configs</h4>
<p>Deprecated: use --server-side-across-configs instead.</p>
<p>Allow server-side operations (e.g. copy) to work across different drive configs.</p>
<p>This can be useful if you wish to do a server-side copy between two different Google drives. Note that this isn't enabled by default because it isn't easy to tell if it will work between any two configurations.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: server_side_across_configs</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_SERVER_SIDE_ACROSS_CONFIGS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="drive-disable-http2">--drive-disable-http2</h4>
<p>Disable drive using http2.</p>
<p>There is currently an unsolved issue with the google drive backend and HTTP/2. HTTP/2 is therefore disabled by default for the drive backend but can be re-enabled here. When the issue is solved this flag will be removed.</p>
<p>See: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3631</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>

<h4 id="drive-stop-on-upload-limit">--drive-stop-on-upload-limit</h4>
<p>Make upload limit errors be fatal.</p>
<p>At the time of writing it is only possible to upload 750 GiB of data to Google Drive a day (this is an undocumented limit). When this limit is reached Google Drive produces a slightly different error message. When this flag is set it causes these errors to be fatal. These will stop the in-progress sync.</p>
<p>Note that this detection is relying on error message strings which Google don't document so it may break in the future.</p>
<p>See: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3857</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: stop_on_upload_limit</li>

<h4 id="drive-stop-on-download-limit">--drive-stop-on-download-limit</h4>
<p>Make download limit errors be fatal.</p>
<p>At the time of writing it is only possible to download 10 TiB of data from Google Drive a day (this is an undocumented limit). When this limit is reached Google Drive produces a slightly different error message. When this flag is set it causes these errors to be fatal. These will stop the in-progress sync.</p>
<p>Note that this detection is relying on error message strings which Google don't document so it may break in the future.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: stop_on_download_limit</li>

<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="drive-skip-shortcuts">--drive-skip-shortcuts</h4>
<p>If set skip shortcut files.</p>
<p>Normally rclone dereferences shortcut files making them appear as if they are the original file (see <a href="#shortcuts">the shortcuts section</a>). If this flag is set then rclone will ignore shortcut files completely.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: skip_shortcuts</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_SKIP_SHORTCUTS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="drive-skip-dangling-shortcuts">--drive-skip-dangling-shortcuts</h4>
<p>If set skip dangling shortcut files.</p>
<p>If this is set then rclone will not show any dangling shortcuts in listings.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: skip_dangling_shortcuts</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_SKIP_DANGLING_SHORTCUTS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="drive-resource-key">--drive-resource-key</h4>
<p>Resource key for accessing a link-shared file.</p>
<p>If you need to access files shared with a link like this</p>
<pre><code>https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/XXX?resourcekey=YYY&amp;usp=sharing</code></pre>
<p>Then you will need to use the first part "XXX" as the "root_folder_id" and the second part "YYY" as the "resource_key" otherwise you will get 404 not found errors when trying to access the directory.</p>
<p>See: https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/resource-keys</p>
<p>This resource key requirement only applies to a subset of old files.</p>
<p>Note also that opening the folder once in the web interface (with the user you've authenticated rclone with) seems to be enough so that the resource key is not needed.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: resource_key</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_RESOURCE_KEY</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="drive-fast-list-bug-fix">--drive-fast-list-bug-fix</h4>
<p>Work around a bug in Google Drive listing.</p>
<p>Normally rclone will work around a bug in Google Drive when using --fast-list (ListR) where the search "(A in parents) or (B in parents)" returns nothing sometimes. See #3114, #4289 and https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/149522397</p>
<p>Rclone detects this by finding no items in more than one directory when listing and retries them as lists of individual directories.</p>
<p>This means that if you have a lot of empty directories rclone will end up listing them all individually and this can take many more API calls.</p>
<p>This flag allows the work-around to be disabled. This is <strong>not</strong> recommended in normal use - only if you have a particular case you are having trouble with like many empty directories.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: fast_list_bug_fix</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_FAST_LIST_BUG_FIX</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: true</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="drive-metadata-owner">--drive-metadata-owner</h4>
<p>Control whether owner should be read or written in metadata.</p>
<p>Owner is a standard part of the file metadata so is easy to read. But it isn't always desirable to set the owner from the metadata.</p>
<p>Note that you can't set the owner on Shared Drives, and that setting ownership will generate an email to the new owner (this can't be disabled), and you can't transfer ownership to someone outside your organization.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: metadata_owner</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_METADATA_OWNER</li>
<li>Type: Bits</li>
<li>Default: read</li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="drive-metadata-permissions">--drive-metadata-permissions</h4>
<p>Control whether permissions should be read or written in metadata.</p>
<p>Reading permissions metadata from files can be done quickly, but it isn't always desirable to set the permissions from the metadata.</p>
<p>Note that rclone drops any inherited permissions on Shared Drives and any owner permission on My Drives as these are duplicated in the owner metadata.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: metadata_permissions</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_METADATA_PERMISSIONS</li>
<li>Type: Bits</li>
<li>Default: off</li>

<li>"failok"
<ul>
<li>If writing fails log errors only, don't fail the transfer</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"read,write"
<ul>
<li>Read and Write the value.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="drive-metadata-labels">--drive-metadata-labels</h4>
<p>Control whether labels should be read or written in metadata.</p>
<p>Reading labels metadata from files takes an extra API transaction and will slow down listings. It isn't always desirable to set the labels from the metadata.</p>
<p>The format of labels is documented in the drive API documentation at https://developers.google.com/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/Label - rclone just provides a JSON dump of this format.</p>
<p>When setting labels, the label and fields must already exist - rclone will not create them. This means that if you are transferring labels from two different accounts you will have to create the labels in advance and use the metadata mapper to translate the IDs between the two accounts.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: metadata_labels</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_METADATA_LABELS</li>
<li>Type: Bits</li>
<li>Default: off</li>

<h2 id="backend-commands-5">Backend commands</h2>
<p>Here are the commands specific to the drive backend.</p>
<p>Run them with</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend COMMAND remote:</code></pre>
<p>The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/">backend</a> command for more info on how to pass options and arguments.</p>
<p>These can be run on a running backend using the rc command <a href="https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command">backend/command</a>.</p>
<h3 id="get">get</h3>
<p>Get command for fetching the drive config parameters</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend get remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This is a get command which will be used to fetch the various drive config parameters</p>
<p>Usage Examples:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend get drive: [-o service_account_file] [-o chunk_size]
rclone rc backend/command command=get fs=drive: [-o service_account_file] [-o chunk_size]</code></pre>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>"chunk_size": show the current upload chunk size</li>
<li>"service_account_file": show the current service account file</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="set-2">set</h3>
<p>Set command for updating the drive config parameters</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend set remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This is a set command which will be used to update the various drive config parameters</p>
<p>Usage Examples:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend set drive: [-o service_account_file=sa.json] [-o chunk_size=67108864]
rclone rc backend/command command=set fs=drive: [-o service_account_file=sa.json] [-o chunk_size=67108864]</code></pre>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>"chunk_size": update the current upload chunk size</li>
<li>"service_account_file": update the current service account file</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="shortcut">shortcut</h3>
<p>Create shortcuts from files or directories</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend shortcut remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This command creates shortcuts from files or directories.</p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend shortcut drive: source_item destination_shortcut
rclone backend shortcut drive: source_item -o target=drive2: destination_shortcut</code></pre>
<p>In the first example this creates a shortcut from the "source_item" which can be a file or a directory to the "destination_shortcut". The "source_item" and the "destination_shortcut" should be relative paths from "drive:"</p>
<p>In the second example this creates a shortcut from the "source_item" relative to "drive:" to the "destination_shortcut" relative to "drive2:". This may fail with a permission error if the user authenticated with "drive2:" can't read files from "drive:".</p>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>"target": optional target remote for the shortcut destination</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="drives">drives</h3>
<p>List the Shared Drives available to this account</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend drives remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This command lists the Shared Drives (Team Drives) available to this account.</p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend [-o config] drives drive:</code></pre>
<p>This will return a JSON list of objects like this</p>
<pre><code>[
    {
        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;0ABCDEF-01234567890&quot;,
        &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;drive#teamDrive&quot;,
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;My Drive&quot;
    },
    {
        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;0ABCDEFabcdefghijkl&quot;,
        &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;drive#teamDrive&quot;,
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Test Drive&quot;
    }
]</code></pre>
<p>With the -o config parameter it will output the list in a format suitable for adding to a config file to make aliases for all the drives found and a combined drive.</p>
<pre><code>[My Drive]
type = alias
remote = drive,team_drive=0ABCDEF-01234567890,root_folder_id=:

[Test Drive]
type = alias
remote = drive,team_drive=0ABCDEFabcdefghijkl,root_folder_id=:

[AllDrives]
type = combine
upstreams = &quot;My Drive=My Drive:&quot; &quot;Test Drive=Test Drive:&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Adding this to the rclone config file will cause those team drives to be accessible with the aliases shown. Any illegal characters will be substituted with "_" and duplicate names will have numbers suffixed. It will also add a remote called AllDrives which shows all the shared drives combined into one directory tree.</p>
<h3 id="untrash">untrash</h3>
<p>Untrash files and directories</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend untrash remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This command untrashes all the files and directories in the directory passed in recursively.</p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<p>This takes an optional directory to trash which make this easier to use via the API.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend untrash drive:directory
rclone backend --interactive untrash drive:directory subdir</code></pre>
<p>Use the --interactive/-i or --dry-run flag to see what would be restored before restoring it.</p>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;Untrashed&quot;: 17,
    &quot;Errors&quot;: 0
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="copyid">copyid</h3>
<p>Copy files by ID</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend copyid remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This command copies files by ID</p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend copyid drive: ID path
rclone backend copyid drive: ID1 path1 ID2 path2</code></pre>
<p>It copies the drive file with ID given to the path (an rclone path which will be passed internally to rclone copyto). The ID and path pairs can be repeated.</p>
<p>The path should end with a / to indicate copy the file as named to this directory. If it doesn't end with a / then the last path component will be used as the file name.</p>
<p>If the destination is a drive backend then server-side copying will be attempted if possible.</p>
<p>Use the --interactive/-i or --dry-run flag to see what would be copied before copying.</p>
<h3 id="moveid">moveid</h3>
<p>Move files by ID</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend moveid remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This command moves files by ID</p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend moveid drive: ID path
rclone backend moveid drive: ID1 path1 ID2 path2</code></pre>
<p>It moves the drive file with ID given to the path (an rclone path which will be passed internally to rclone moveto).</p>
<p>The path should end with a / to indicate move the file as named to this directory. If it doesn't end with a / then the last path component will be used as the file name.</p>
<p>If the destination is a drive backend then server-side moving will be attempted if possible.</p>
<p>Use the --interactive/-i or --dry-run flag to see what would be moved beforehand.</p>
<h3 id="exportformats">exportformats</h3>
<p>Dump the export formats for debug purposes</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend exportformats remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<h3 id="importformats">importformats</h3>
<p>Dump the import formats for debug purposes</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend importformats remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<h3 id="query">query</h3>
<p>List files using Google Drive query language</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend query remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This command lists files based on a query</p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend query drive: query</code></pre>
<p>The query syntax is documented at <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/ref-search-terms">Google Drive Search query terms and operators</a>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend query drive: &quot;&#39;0ABc9DEFGHIJKLMNop0QRatUVW3X&#39; in parents and name contains &#39;foo&#39;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If the query contains literal ' or  characters, these need to be escaped with  characters. "'" becomes "'" and "" becomes "\", for example to match a file named "foo ' .txt":</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend query drive: &quot;name = &#39;foo \&#39; \\\.txt&#39;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The result is a JSON array of matches, for example:</p>
<pre><code>[
{
    &quot;createdTime&quot;: &quot;2017-06-29T19:58:28.537Z&quot;,

}
]</code></pre>
<h3 id="rescue">rescue</h3>
<p>Rescue or delete any orphaned files</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend rescue remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This command rescues or deletes any orphaned files or directories.</p>
<p>Sometimes files can get orphaned in Google Drive. This means that they are no longer in any folder in Google Drive.</p>
<p>This command finds those files and either rescues them to a directory you specify or deletes them.</p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<p>This can be used in 3 ways.</p>
<p>First, list all orphaned files</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend rescue drive:</code></pre>
<p>Second rescue all orphaned files to the directory indicated</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend rescue drive: &quot;relative/path/to/rescue/directory&quot;</code></pre>
<p>e.g. To rescue all orphans to a directory called "Orphans" in the top level</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend rescue drive: Orphans</code></pre>
<p>Third delete all orphaned files to the trash</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend rescue drive: -o delete</code></pre>
<h2 id="limitations-15">Limitations</h2>
<p>Drive has quite a lot of rate limiting. This causes rclone to be limited to transferring about 2 files per second only. Individual files may be transferred much faster at 100s of MiB/s but lots of small files can take a long time.</p>
<p>Server side copies are also subject to a separate rate limit. If you see User rate limit exceeded errors, wait at least 24 hours and retry. You can disable server-side copies with <code>--disable copy</code> to download and upload the files if you prefer.</p>
<h3 id="limitations-of-google-docs">Limitations of Google Docs</h3>
<p>Google docs will appear as size -1 in <code>rclone ls</code>, <code>rclone ncdu</code> etc, and as size 0 in anything which uses the VFS layer, e.g. <code>rclone mount</code> and <code>rclone serve</code>. When calculating directory totals, e.g. in <code>rclone size</code> and <code>rclone ncdu</code>, they will be counted in as empty files.</p>
<p>This is because rclone can't find out the size of the Google docs without downloading them.</p>
<p>Google docs will transfer correctly with <code>rclone sync</code>, <code>rclone copy</code> etc as rclone knows to ignore the size when doing the transfer.</p>
<p>However an unfortunate consequence of this is that you may not be able to download Google docs using <code>rclone mount</code>. If it doesn't work you will get a 0 sized file. If you try again the doc may gain its correct size and be downloadable. Whether it will work on not depends on the application accessing the mount and the OS you are running - experiment to find out if it does work for you!</p>
<h3 id="duplicated-files-3">Duplicated files</h3>
<p>Sometimes, for no reason I've been able to track down, drive will duplicate a file that rclone uploads. Drive unlike all the other remotes can have duplicated files.</p>
<p>Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see messages in the log about duplicates.</p>
<p>Use <code>rclone dedupe</code> to fix duplicated files.</p>
<p>Note that this isn't just a problem with rclone, even Google Photos on Android duplicates files on drive sometimes.</p>
<h3 id="rclone-appears-to-be-re-copying-files-it-shouldnt">Rclone appears to be re-copying files it shouldn't</h3>
<p>The most likely cause of this is the duplicated file issue above - run <code>rclone dedupe</code> and check your logs for duplicate object or directory messages.</p>
<p>This can also be caused by a delay/caching on google drive's end when comparing directory listings. Specifically with team drives used in combination with --fast-list. Files that were uploaded recently may not appear on the directory list sent to rclone when using --fast-list.</p>
<p>Waiting a moderate period of time between attempts (estimated to be approximately 1 hour) and/or not using --fast-list both seem to be effective in preventing the problem.</p>
<h3 id="sha1-or-sha256-hashes-may-be-missing">SHA1 or SHA256 hashes may be missing</h3>
<p>All files have MD5 hashes, but a small fraction of files uploaded may not have SHA1 or SHA256 hashes especially if they were uploaded before 2018.</p>
<h2 id="making-your-own-client_id">Making your own client_id</h2>
<p>When you use rclone with Google drive in its default configuration you are using rclone's client_id. This is shared between all the rclone users. There is a global rate limit on the number of queries per second that each client_id can do set by Google. rclone already has a high quota and I will continue to make sure it is high enough by contacting Google.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to use your own client ID as the default rclone ID is heavily used. If you have multiple services running, it is recommended to use an API key for each service. The default Google quota is 10 transactions per second so it is recommended to stay under that number as if you use more than that, it will cause rclone to rate limit and make things slower.</p>
<p>Here is how to create your own Google Drive client ID for rclone:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Log into the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/">Google API Console</a> with your Google account. It doesn't matter what Google account you use. (It need not be the same account as the Google Drive you want to access)</p></li>
<li><p>Select a project or create a new project.</p></li>
<li><p>Under "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" search for "Drive", and enable the "Google Drive API".</p></li>
<li><p>Click "Credentials" in the left-side panel (not "Create credentials", which opens the wizard).</p></li>
<li><p>If you already configured an "Oauth Consent Screen", then skip to the next step; if not, click on "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN" button (near the top right corner of the right panel), then select "External" and click on "CREATE"; on the next screen, enter an "Application name" ("rclone" is OK); enter "User Support Email" (your own email is OK); enter "Developer Contact Email" (your own email is OK); then click on "Save" (all other data is optional). You will also have to add <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth">some scopes</a>, including</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/docs</code></li>
<li><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive</code> in order to be able to edit, create and delete files with RClone.</li>
<li><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly</code> which you may also want to add.</li>
<li>If you want to add all at once, comma separated it would be <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/docs,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly</code>.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>After adding scopes, click "Save and continue" to add test users. Be sure to add your own account to the test users. Once you've added yourself as a test user and saved the changes, click again on "Credentials" on the left panel to go back to the "Credentials" screen.</p>
<p>(PS: if you are a GSuite user, you could also select "Internal" instead of "External" above, but this will restrict API use to Google Workspace users in your organisation).</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" button at the top of the screen, then select "OAuth client ID".</p></li>
<li><p>Choose an application type of "Desktop app" and click "Create". (the default name is fine)</p></li>
<li><p>It will show you a client ID and client secret. Make a note of these.</p>
<p>(If you selected "External" at Step 5 continue to Step 10. If you chose "Internal" you don't need to publish and can skip straight to Step 11 but your destination drive must be part of the same Google Workspace.)</p></li>
<li><p>Go to "Oauth consent screen" and then click "PUBLISH APP" button and confirm. You will also want to add yourself as a test user.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide the noted client ID and client secret to rclone.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Be aware that, due to the "enhanced security" recently introduced by Google, you are theoretically expected to "submit your app for verification" and then wait a few weeks(!) for their response; in practice, you can go right ahead and use the client ID and client secret with rclone, the only issue will be a very scary confirmation screen shown when you connect via your browser for rclone to be able to get its token-id (but as this only happens during the remote configuration, it's not such a big deal). Keeping the application in "Testing" will work as well, but the limitation is that any grants will expire after a week, which can be annoying to refresh constantly. If, for whatever reason, a short grant time is not a problem, then keeping the application in testing mode would also be sufficient.</p>
<p>(Thanks to <span class="citation" data-cites="balazer">@balazer</span> on github for these instructions.)</p>
<p>Sometimes, creation of an OAuth consent in Google API Console fails due to an error message “The request failed because changes to one of the field of the resource is not supported”. As a convenient workaround, the necessary Google Drive API key can be created on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python">Python Quickstart</a> page. Just push the Enable the Drive API button to receive the Client ID and Secret. Note that it will automatically create a new project in the API Console.</p>
<h1 id="google-photos">Google Photos</h1>
<p>The rclone backend for <a href="https://www.google.com/photos/about/">Google Photos</a> is a specialized backend for transferring photos and videos to and from Google Photos.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> The Google Photos API which rclone uses has quite a few limitations, so please read the <a href="#limitations">limitations section</a> carefully to make sure it is suitable for your use.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> From March 31, 2025 rclone can only download photos it uploaded. This limitation is due to policy changes at Google. You may need to run <code>rclone config reconnect remote:</code> to make rclone work again after upgrading to rclone v1.70.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-21">Configuration</h2>
<p>The initial setup for google cloud storage involves getting a token from Google Photos which you need to do in your browser. <code>rclone config</code> walks you through it.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to make a remote called <code>remote</code>. First run:</p>
<pre><code> rclone config</code></pre>
<p>This will guide you through an interactive setup process:</p>
<pre><code>No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q&gt; n
name&gt; remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (&quot;&quot;).

Set to make the Google Photos backend read only.

If you choose read only then rclone will only request read only access
to your photos, otherwise rclone will request full access.
Enter a boolean value (true or false). Press Enter for the default (&quot;false&quot;).
read_only&gt; 
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No
y/n&gt; n
Remote config
Use web browser to automatically authenticate rclone with remote?
 * Say Y if the machine running rclone has a web browser you can use
 * Say N if running rclone on a (remote) machine without web browser access
If not sure try Y. If Y failed, try N.
y) Yes
n) No
y/n&gt; y
If your browser doesn&#39;t open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access

e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d&gt; y</code></pre>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/remote_setup/">remote setup docs</a> for how to set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.</p>
<p>Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the token as returned from Google if using web browser to automatically authenticate. This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is on <code>http://127.0.0.1:53682/</code> and this may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall, or use manual mode.</p>
<p>This remote is called <code>remote</code> and can now be used like this</p>
<p>See all the albums in your photos</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:album</code></pre>
<p>Make a new album</p>
<pre><code>rclone mkdir remote:album/newAlbum</code></pre>
<p>List the contents of an album</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:album/newAlbum</code></pre>
<p>Sync <code>/home/local/images</code> to the Google Photos, removing any excess files in the album.</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive /home/local/image remote:album/newAlbum</code></pre>
<h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>
<p>As Google Photos is not a general purpose cloud storage system, the backend is laid out to help you navigate it.</p>
<p>The directories under <code>media</code> show different ways of categorizing the media. Each file will appear multiple times. So if you want to make a backup of your google photos you might choose to backup <code>remote:media/by-month</code>. (<strong>NB</strong> <code>remote:media/by-day</code> is rather slow at the moment so avoid for syncing.)</p>
<p>Note that all your photos and videos will appear somewhere under <code>media</code>, but they may not appear under <code>album</code> unless you've put them into albums.</p>

<p>There are two writable parts of the tree, the <code>upload</code> directory and sub directories of the <code>album</code> directory.</p>
<p>The <code>upload</code> directory is for uploading files you don't want to put into albums. This will be empty to start with and will contain the files you've uploaded for one rclone session only, becoming empty again when you restart rclone. The use case for this would be if you have a load of files you just want to once off dump into Google Photos. For repeated syncing, uploading to <code>album</code> will work better.</p>
<p>Directories within the <code>album</code> directory are also writeable and you may create new directories (albums) under <code>album</code>. If you copy files with a directory hierarchy in there then rclone will create albums with the <code>/</code> character in them. For example if you do</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy /path/to/images remote:album/images</code></pre>
<p>and the images directory contains</p>
<pre><code>images
    - file1.jpg
    dir
        file2.jpg
    dir2
        dir3
            file3.jpg</code></pre>
<p>Then rclone will create the following albums with the following files in</p>
<ul>
<li>images
<ul>
<li>file1.jpg</li>
</ul></li>
<li>images/dir
<ul>
<li>file2.jpg</li>
</ul></li>
<li>images/dir2/dir3
<ul>
<li>file3.jpg</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This means that you can use the <code>album</code> path pretty much like a normal filesystem and it is a good target for repeated syncing.</p>
<p>The <code>shared-album</code> directory shows albums shared with you or by you. This is similar to the Sharing tab in the Google Photos web interface.</p>

<li>Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gphotos-read-size">--gphotos-read-size</h4>
<p>Set to read the size of media items.</p>
<p>Normally rclone does not read the size of media items since this takes another transaction. This isn't necessary for syncing. However rclone mount needs to know the size of files in advance of reading them, so setting this flag when using rclone mount is recommended if you want to read the media.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: read_size</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_READ_SIZE</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gphotos-start-year">--gphotos-start-year</h4>
<p>Year limits the photos to be downloaded to those which are uploaded after the given year.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: start_year</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_START_YEAR</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 2000</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gphotos-include-archived">--gphotos-include-archived</h4>
<p>Also view and download archived media.</p>
<p>By default, rclone does not request archived media. Thus, when syncing, archived media is not visible in directory listings or transferred.</p>
<p>Note that media in albums is always visible and synced, no matter their archive status.</p>
<p>With this flag, archived media are always visible in directory listings and transferred.</p>
<p>Without this flag, archived media will not be visible in directory listings and won't be transferred.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: include_archived</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_INCLUDE_ARCHIVED</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gphotos-proxy">--gphotos-proxy</h4>
<p>Use the gphotosdl proxy for downloading the full resolution images</p>
<p>The Google API will deliver images and video which aren't full resolution, and/or have EXIF data missing.</p>
<p>However if you use the gphotosdl proxy then you can download original, unchanged images.</p>
<p>This runs a headless browser in the background.</p>
<p>Download the software from <a href="https://github.com/rclone/gphotosdl">gphotosdl</a></p>
<p>First run with</p>
<pre><code>gphotosdl -login</code></pre>
<p>Then once you have logged into google photos close the browser window and run</p>
<pre><code>gphotosdl</code></pre>
<p>Then supply the parameter <code>--gphotos-proxy "http://localhost:8282"</code> to make rclone use the proxy.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: proxy</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_PROXY</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gphotos-encoding">--gphotos-encoding</h4>
<p>The encoding for the backend.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding">encoding section in the overview</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: encoding</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_ENCODING</li>
<li>Type: Encoding</li>
<li>Default: Slash,CrLf,InvalidUtf8,Dot</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gphotos-batch-mode">--gphotos-batch-mode</h4>
<p>Upload file batching sync|async|off.</p>
<p>This sets the batch mode used by rclone.</p>
<p>This has 3 possible values</p>
<ul>
<li>off - no batching</li>
<li>sync - batch uploads and check completion (default)</li>
<li>async - batch upload and don't check completion</li>
</ul>
<p>Rclone will close any outstanding batches when it exits which may make a delay on quit.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: batch_mode</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_BATCH_MODE</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Default: "sync"</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gphotos-batch-size">--gphotos-batch-size</h4>
<p>Max number of files in upload batch.</p>
<p>This sets the batch size of files to upload. It has to be less than 50.</p>
<p>By default this is 0 which means rclone will calculate the batch size depending on the setting of batch_mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>batch_mode: async - default batch_size is 50</li>
<li>batch_mode: sync - default batch_size is the same as --transfers</li>
<li>batch_mode: off - not in use</li>
</ul>
<p>Rclone will close any outstanding batches when it exits which may make a delay on quit.</p>
<p>Setting this is a great idea if you are uploading lots of small files as it will make them a lot quicker. You can use --transfers 32 to maximise throughput.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: batch_size</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_BATCH_SIZE</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 0</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gphotos-batch-timeout">--gphotos-batch-timeout</h4>
<p>Max time to allow an idle upload batch before uploading.</p>
<p>If an upload batch is idle for more than this long then it will be uploaded.</p>
<p>The default for this is 0 which means rclone will choose a sensible default based on the batch_mode in use.</p>
<ul>
<li>batch_mode: async - default batch_timeout is 10s</li>
<li>batch_mode: sync - default batch_timeout is 1s</li>
<li>batch_mode: off - not in use</li>
</ul>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: batch_timeout</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_BATCH_TIMEOUT</li>
<li>Type: Duration</li>
<li>Default: 0s</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gphotos-batch-commit-timeout">--gphotos-batch-commit-timeout</h4>
<p>Max time to wait for a batch to finish committing. (no longer used)</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: batch_commit_timeout</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_BATCH_COMMIT_TIMEOUT</li>
<li>Type: Duration</li>
<li>Default: 10m0s</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gphotos-description">--gphotos-description</h4>
<p>Description of the remote.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: description</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_DESCRIPTION</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limitations-16">Limitations</h2>
<p>Only images and videos can be uploaded. If you attempt to upload non videos or images or formats that Google Photos doesn't understand, rclone will upload the file, then Google Photos will give an error when it is put turned into a media item.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> From March 31, 2025 rclone can only download photos it uploaded. This limitation is due to policy changes at Google. You may need to run <code>rclone config reconnect remote:</code> to make rclone work again after upgrading to rclone v1.70.</p>
<p>Note that all media items uploaded to Google Photos through the API are stored in full resolution at "original quality" and <strong>will</strong> count towards your storage quota in your Google Account. The API does <strong>not</strong> offer a way to upload in "high quality" mode..</p>
<p><code>rclone about</code> is not supported by the Google Photos backend. Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy <code>mfs</code> (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">List of backends that do not support rclone about</a> See <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/">rclone about</a></p>
<h3 id="downloading-images">Downloading Images</h3>
<p>When Images are downloaded this strips EXIF location (according to the docs and my tests). This is a limitation of the Google Photos API and is covered by <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/112096115">bug #112096115</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The current google API does not allow photos to be downloaded at original resolution. This is very important if you are, for example, relying on "Google Photos" as a backup of your photos. You will not be able to use rclone to redownload original images. You could use 'google takeout' to recover the original photos as a last resort</strong></p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> you <strong>can</strong> use the <a href="#gphotos-proxy">--gphotos-proxy</a> flag to use a headless browser to download images in full resolution.</p>
<h3 id="downloading-videos">Downloading Videos</h3>
<p>When videos are downloaded they are downloaded in a really compressed version of the video compared to downloading it via the Google Photos web interface. This is covered by <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/113672044">bug #113672044</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> you <strong>can</strong> use the <a href="#gphotos-proxy">--gphotos-proxy</a> flag to use a headless browser to download images in full resolution.</p>
<h3 id="duplicates">Duplicates</h3>
<p>If a file name is duplicated in a directory then rclone will add the file ID into its name. So two files called <code>file.jpg</code> would then appear as <code>file {123456}.jpg</code> and <code>file {ABCDEF}.jpg</code> (the actual IDs are a lot longer alas!).</p>
<p>If you upload the same image (with the same binary data) twice then Google Photos will deduplicate it. However it will retain the filename from the first upload which may confuse rclone. For example if you uploaded an image to <code>upload</code> then uploaded the same image to <code>album/my_album</code> the filename of the image in <code>album/my_album</code> will be what it was uploaded with initially, not what you uploaded it with to <code>album</code>. In practise this shouldn't cause too many problems.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-6">Modification times</h3>
<p>The date shown of media in Google Photos is the creation date as determined by the EXIF information, or the upload date if that is not known.</p>
<p>This is not changeable by rclone and is not the modification date of the media on local disk. This means that rclone cannot use the dates from Google Photos for syncing purposes.</p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>The Google Photos API does not return the size of media. This means that when syncing to Google Photos, rclone can only do a file existence check.</p>
<p>It is possible to read the size of the media, but this needs an extra HTTP HEAD request per media item so is <strong>very slow</strong> and uses up a lot of transactions. This can be enabled with the <code>--gphotos-read-size</code> option or the <code>read_size = true</code> config parameter.</p>
<p>If you want to use the backend with <code>rclone mount</code> you may need to enable this flag (depending on your OS and application using the photos) otherwise you may not be able to read media off the mount. You'll need to experiment to see if it works for you without the flag.</p>
<h3 id="albums">Albums</h3>
<p>Rclone can only upload files to albums it created. This is a <a href="https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/manage-albums">limitation of the Google Photos API</a>.</p>
<p>Rclone can remove files it uploaded from albums it created only.</p>
<h3 id="deleting-files-2">Deleting files</h3>
<p>Rclone can remove files from albums it created, but note that the Google Photos API does not allow media to be deleted permanently so this media will still remain. See <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/109759781">bug #109759781</a>.</p>
<p>Rclone cannot delete files anywhere except under <code>album</code>.</p>
<h3 id="deleting-albums">Deleting albums</h3>
<p>The Google Photos API does not support deleting albums - see <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/135714733">bug #135714733</a>.</p>
<h1 id="hasher">Hasher</h1>
<p>Hasher is a special overlay backend to create remotes which handle checksums for other remotes. It's main functions include: - Emulate hash types unimplemented by backends - Cache checksums to help with slow hashing of large local or (S)FTP files - Warm up checksum cache from external SUM files</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-1">Getting started</h2>
<p>To use Hasher, first set up the underlying remote following the configuration instructions for that remote. You can also use a local pathname instead of a remote. Check that your base remote is working.</p>
<p>Let's call the base remote <code>myRemote:path</code> here. Note that anything inside <code>myRemote:path</code> will be handled by hasher and anything outside won't. This means that if you are using a bucket based remote (S3, B2, Swift) then you should put the bucket in the remote <code>s3:bucket</code>.</p>
<p>Now proceed to interactive or manual configuration.</p>
<h3 id="interactive-configuration">Interactive configuration</h3>
<p>Run <code>rclone config</code>:</p>
<pre><code>No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q&gt; n
name&gt; Hasher1
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Handle checksums for other remotes
   \ &quot;hasher&quot;
[snip]
Storage&gt; hasher
Remote to cache checksums for, like myremote:mypath.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (&quot;&quot;).
remote&gt; myRemote:path
Comma separated list of supported checksum types.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (&quot;md5,sha1&quot;).
hashsums&gt; md5
Maximum time to keep checksums in cache. 0 = no cache, off = cache forever.
max_age&gt; off
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No
y/n&gt; n
Remote config
--------------------
[Hasher1]
type = hasher
remote = myRemote:path
hashsums = md5
max_age = off
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d&gt; y</code></pre>
<h3 id="manual-configuration">Manual configuration</h3>
<p>Run <code>rclone config path</code> to see the path of current active config file, usually <code>YOURHOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf</code>. Open it in your favorite text editor, find section for the base remote and create new section for hasher like in the following examples:</p>
<pre><code>[Hasher1]
type = hasher
remote = myRemote:path
hashes = md5
max_age = off

[Hasher2]
type = hasher
remote = /local/path
hashes = dropbox,sha1
max_age = 24h</code></pre>
<p>Hasher takes basically the following parameters: - <code>remote</code> is required, - <code>hashes</code> is a comma separated list of supported checksums (by default <code>md5,sha1</code>), - <code>max_age</code> - maximum time to keep a checksum value in the cache, <code>0</code> will disable caching completely, <code>off</code> will cache "forever" (that is until the files get changed).</p>
<p>Make sure the <code>remote</code> has <code>:</code> (colon) in. If you specify the remote without a colon then rclone will use a local directory of that name. So if you use a remote of <code>/local/path</code> then rclone will handle hashes for that directory. If you use <code>remote = name</code> literally then rclone will put files <strong>in a directory called <code>name</code> located under current directory</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="usage-1">Usage</h2>
<h3 id="basic-operations">Basic operations</h3>
<p>Now you can use it as <code>Hasher2:subdir/file</code> instead of base remote. Hasher will transparently update cache with new checksums when a file is fully read or overwritten, like:</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy External:path/file Hasher:dest/path

rclone cat Hasher:path/to/file &gt; /dev/null</code></pre>
<p>The way to refresh <strong>all</strong> cached checksums (even unsupported by the base backend) for a subtree is to <strong>re-download</strong> all files in the subtree. For example, use <code>hashsum --download</code> using <strong>any</strong> supported hashsum on the command line (we just care to re-read):</p>
<pre><code>rclone hashsum MD5 --download Hasher:path/to/subtree &gt; /dev/null

rclone backend dump Hasher:path/to/subtree</code></pre>
<p>You can print or drop hashsum cache using custom backend commands:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend dump Hasher:dir/subdir

rclone backend drop Hasher:</code></pre>
<h3 id="pre-seed-from-a-sum-file">Pre-Seed from a SUM File</h3>
<p>Hasher supports two backend commands: generic SUM file <code>import</code> and faster but less consistent <code>stickyimport</code>.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend import Hasher:dir/subdir SHA1 /path/to/SHA1SUM [--checkers 4]</code></pre>
<p>Instead of SHA1 it can be any hash supported by the remote. The last argument can point to either a local or an <code>other-remote:path</code> text file in SUM format. The command will parse the SUM file, then walk down the path given by the first argument, snapshot current fingerprints and fill in the cache entries correspondingly. - Paths in the SUM file are treated as relative to <code>hasher:dir/subdir</code>. - The command will <strong>not</strong> check that supplied values are correct. You <strong>must know</strong> what you are doing. - This is a one-time action. The SUM file will not get "attached" to the remote. Cache entries can still be overwritten later, should the object's fingerprint change. - The tree walk can take long depending on the tree size. You can increase <code>--checkers</code> to make it faster. Or use <code>stickyimport</code> if you don't care about fingerprints and consistency.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend stickyimport hasher:path/to/data sha1 remote:/path/to/sum.sha1</code></pre>
<p><code>stickyimport</code> is similar to <code>import</code> but works much faster because it does not need to stat existing files and skips initial tree walk. Instead of binding cache entries to file fingerprints it creates <em>sticky</em> entries bound to the file name alone ignoring size, modification time etc. Such hash entries can be replaced only by <code>purge</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>backend drop</code> or by full re-read/re-write of the files.</p>

<h2 id="implementation-details-advanced">Implementation details (advanced)</h2>
<p>This section explains how various rclone operations work on a hasher remote.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer. This section describes current implementation which can change in future rclone versions!.</strong></p>
<h3 id="hashsum-command">Hashsum command</h3>
<p>The <code>rclone hashsum</code> (or <code>md5sum</code> or <code>sha1sum</code>) command will:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>if requested hash is supported by lower level, just pass it.</li>
<li>if object size is below <code>auto_size</code> then download object and calculate <em>requested</em> hashes on the fly.</li>
<li>if unsupported and the size is big enough, build object <code>fingerprint</code> (including size, modtime if supported, first-found <em>other</em> hash if any).</li>
<li>if the strict match is found in cache for the requested remote, return the stored hash.</li>
<li>if remote found but fingerprint mismatched, then purge the entry and proceed to step 6.</li>
<li>if remote not found or had no requested hash type or after step 5: download object, calculate all <em>supported</em> hashes on the fly and store in cache; return requested hash.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="other-operations">Other operations</h3>
<ul>
<li>any time a hash is requested, follow the logic from 1-4 from <code>hashsum</code> above</li>
<li>whenever a file is uploaded or downloaded <strong>in full</strong>, capture the stream to calculate all supported hashes on the fly and update database</li>
<li>server-side <code>move</code> will update keys of existing cache entries</li>
<li><code>deletefile</code> will remove a single cache entry</li>
<li><code>purge</code> will remove all cache entries under the purged path</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that setting <code>max_age = 0</code> will disable checksum caching completely.</p>
<p>If you set <code>max_age = off</code>, checksums in cache will never age, unless you fully rewrite or delete the file.</p>
<h3 id="cache-storage">Cache storage</h3>
<p>Cached checksums are stored as <code>bolt</code> database files under rclone cache directory, usually <code>~/.cache/rclone/kv/</code>. Databases are maintained one per <em>base</em> backend, named like <code>BaseRemote~hasher.bolt</code>. Checksums for multiple <code>alias</code>-es into a single base backend will be stored in the single database. All local paths are treated as aliases into the <code>local</code> backend (unless encrypted or chunked) and stored in <code>~/.cache/rclone/kv/local~hasher.bolt</code>. Databases can be shared between multiple rclone processes.</p>

<p>Paths are specified as <code>remote:path</code></p>
<p>Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. <code>remote:directory/subdirectory</code>.</p>
<p>The initial setup for hidrive involves getting a token from HiDrive which you need to do in your browser. <code>rclone config</code> walks you through it.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-23">Configuration</h2>
<p>Here is an example of how to make a remote called <code>remote</code>. First run:</p>

Keep this &quot;remote&quot; remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d&gt; y</code></pre>
<p><strong>You should be aware that OAuth-tokens can be used to access your account and hence should not be shared with other persons.</strong> See the <a href="#keeping-your-tokens-safe">below section</a> for more information.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/remote_setup/">remote setup docs</a> for how to set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.</p>
<p>Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the token as returned from HiDrive. This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. The webserver runs on <code>http://127.0.0.1:53682/</code>. If local port <code>53682</code> is protected by a firewall you may need to temporarily unblock the firewall to complete authorization.</p>
<p>Once configured you can then use <code>rclone</code> like this,</p>
<p>List directories in top level of your HiDrive root folder</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:</code></pre>
<p>List all the files in your HiDrive filesystem</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:</code></pre>
<p>To copy a local directory to a HiDrive directory called backup</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy /home/source remote:backup</code></pre>
<h3 id="keeping-your-tokens-safe">Keeping your tokens safe</h3>
<p>Any OAuth-tokens will be stored by rclone in the remote's configuration file as unencrypted text. Anyone can use a valid refresh-token to access your HiDrive filesystem without knowing your password. Therefore you should make sure no one else can access your configuration.</p>
<p>It is possible to encrypt rclone's configuration file. You can find information on securing your configuration file by viewing the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#configuration-encryption">configuration encryption docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="invalid-refresh-token-1">Invalid refresh token</h3>
<p>As can be verified <a href="https://developer.hidrive.com/basics-flows/">here</a>, each <code>refresh_token</code> (for Native Applications) is valid for 60 days. If used to access HiDrivei, its validity will be automatically extended.</p>
<p>This means that if you</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use the HiDrive remote for 60 days</li>
</ul>
<p>then rclone will return an error which includes a text that implies the refresh token is <em>invalid</em> or <em>expired</em>.</p>
<p>To fix this you will need to authorize rclone to access your HiDrive account again.</p>
<p>Using</p>
<pre><code>rclone config reconnect remote:</code></pre>
<p>the process is very similar to the process of initial setup exemplified before.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-10">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>HiDrive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1 second.</p>
<p>HiDrive supports <a href="https://static.hidrive.com/dev/0001">its own hash type</a> which is used to verify the integrity of file contents after successful transfers.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-filename-characters-12">Restricted filename characters</h3>
<p>HiDrive cannot store files or folders that include <code>/</code> (0x2F) or null-bytes (0x00) in their name. Any other characters can be used in the names of files or folders. Additionally, files or folders cannot be named either of the following: <code>.</code> or <code>..</code></p>
<p>Therefore rclone will automatically replace these characters, if files or folders are stored or accessed with such names.</p>
<p>You can read about how this filename encoding works in general <a href="overview/#restricted-filenames">here</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that HiDrive only supports file or folder names with a length of 255 characters or less.</p>
<h3 id="transfers-3">Transfers</h3>
<p>HiDrive limits file sizes per single request to a maximum of 2 GiB. To allow storage of larger files and allow for better upload performance, the hidrive backend will use a chunked transfer for files larger than 96 MiB. Rclone will upload multiple parts/chunks of the file at the same time. Chunks in the process of being uploaded are buffered in memory, so you may want to restrict this behaviour on systems with limited resources.</p>
<p>You can customize this behaviour using the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>chunk_size</code>: size of file parts</li>
<li><code>upload_cutoff</code>: files larger or equal to this in size will use a chunked transfer</li>
<li><code>upload_concurrency</code>: number of file-parts to upload at the same time</li>
</ul>
<p>See the below section about configuration options for more details.</p>
<h3 id="root-folder">Root folder</h3>
<p>You can set the root folder for rclone. This is the directory that rclone considers to be the root of your HiDrive.</p>
<p>Usually, you will leave this blank, and rclone will use the root of the account.</p>
<p>However, you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder hierarchy.</p>
<p>This works by prepending the contents of the <code>root_prefix</code> option to any paths accessed by rclone. For example, the following two ways to access the home directory are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd --hidrive-root-prefix=&quot;/users/test/&quot; remote:path

rclone lsd remote:/users/test/path</code></pre>
<p>See the below section about configuration options for more details.</p>
<h3 id="directory-member-count">Directory member count</h3>
<p>By default, rclone will know the number of directory members contained in a directory. For example, <code>rclone lsd</code> uses this information.</p>
<p>The acquisition of this information will result in additional time costs for HiDrive's API. When dealing with large directory structures, it may be desirable to circumvent this time cost, especially when this information is not explicitly needed. For this, the <code>disable_fetching_member_count</code> option can be used.</p>
<p>See the below section about configuration options for more details.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-18">Limitations</h2>
<h3 id="symbolic-links">Symbolic links</h3>
<p>HiDrive is able to store symbolic links (<em>symlinks</em>) by design, for example, when unpacked from a zip archive.</p>
<p>There exists no direct mechanism to manage native symlinks in remotes. As such this implementation has chosen to ignore any native symlinks present in the remote. rclone will not be able to access or show any symlinks stored in the hidrive-remote. This means symlinks cannot be individually removed, copied, or moved, except when removing, copying, or moving the parent folder.</p>
<p><em>This does not affect the <code>.rclonelink</code>-files that rclone uses to encode and store symbolic links.</em></p>
<h3 id="sparse-files">Sparse files</h3>
<p>It is possible to store sparse files in HiDrive.</p>
<p>Note that copying a sparse file will expand the holes into null-byte (0x00) regions that will then consume disk space. Likewise, when downloading a sparse file, the resulting file will have null-byte regions in the place of file holes.</p>
<h1 id="http">HTTP</h1>
<p>The HTTP remote is a read only remote for reading files of a webserver. The webserver should provide file listings which rclone will read and turn into a remote. This has been tested with common webservers such as Apache/Nginx/Caddy and will likely work with file listings from most web servers. (If it doesn't then please file an issue, or send a pull request!)</p>
<p>Paths are specified as <code>remote:</code> or <code>remote:path</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>remote:</code> represents the configured <a href="#http-url">url</a>, and any path following it will be resolved relative to this url, according to the URL standard. This means with remote url <code>https://beta.rclone.org/branch</code> and path <code>fix</code>, the resolved URL will be <code>https://beta.rclone.org/branch/fix</code>, while with path <code>/fix</code> the resolved URL will be <code>https://beta.rclone.org/fix</code> as the absolute path is resolved from the root of the domain.</p>
<p>If the path following the <code>remote:</code> ends with <code>/</code> it will be assumed to point to a directory. If the path does not end with <code>/</code>, then a HEAD request is sent and the response used to decide if it it is treated as a file or a directory (run with <code>-vv</code> to see details). When <a href="#http-no-head">--http-no-head</a> is specified, a path without ending <code>/</code> is always assumed to be a file. If rclone incorrectly assumes the path is a file, the solution is to specify the path with ending <code>/</code>. When you know the path is a directory, ending it with <code>/</code> is always better as it avoids the initial HEAD request.</p>
<p>To just download a single file it is easier to use <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copyurl/">copyurl</a>.</p>

<h3 id="read-only">Read only</h3>
<p>This remote is read only - you can't upload files to an HTTP server.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-8">Modification times</h3>
<p>Most HTTP servers store time accurate to 1 second.</p>
<h3 id="checksum-1">Checksum</h3>
<p>No checksums are stored.</p>
<h3 id="usage-without-a-config-file">Usage without a config file</h3>
<p>Since the http remote only has one config parameter it is easy to use without a config file:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd --http-url https://beta.rclone.org :http:</code></pre>

<h3 id="standard-options-25">Standard options</h3>
<p>Here are the Standard options specific to http (HTTP).</p>
<h4 id="http-url">--http-url</h4>
<p>URL of HTTP host to connect to.</p>
<p>E.g. "https://example.com", or "https://user:pass@example.com" to use a username and password.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: url</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_HTTP_URL</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: true</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="http-no-escape">--http-no-escape</h4>
<p>Do not escape URL metacharacters in path names.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: no_escape</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_HTTP_NO_ESCAPE</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advanced-options-25">Advanced options</h3>
<p>Here are the Advanced options specific to http (HTTP).</p>
<h4 id="http-headers">--http-headers</h4>
<p>Set HTTP headers for all transactions.</p>
<p>Use this to set additional HTTP headers for all transactions.</p>
<p>The input format is comma separated list of key,value pairs. Standard <a href="https://godoc.org/encoding/csv">CSV encoding</a> may be used.</p>
<p>For example, to set a Cookie use 'Cookie,name=value', or '"Cookie","name=value"'.</p>
<p>You can set multiple headers, e.g. '"Cookie","name=value","Authorization","xxx"'.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: headers</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_HTTP_HEADERS</li>
<li>Type: CommaSepList</li>
<li>Default:</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="http-no-slash">--http-no-slash</h4>
<p>Set this if the site doesn't end directories with /.</p>
<p>Use this if your target website does not use / on the end of directories.</p>
<p>A / on the end of a path is how rclone normally tells the difference between files and directories. If this flag is set, then rclone will treat all files with Content-Type: text/html as directories and read URLs from them rather than downloading them.</p>
<p>Note that this may cause rclone to confuse genuine HTML files with directories.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: no_slash</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_HTTP_NO_SLASH</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="http-no-head">--http-no-head</h4>
<p>Don't use HEAD requests.</p>
<p>HEAD requests are mainly used to find file sizes in dir listing. If your site is being very slow to load then you can try this option. Normally rclone does a HEAD request for each potential file in a directory listing to:</p>
<ul>
<li>find its size</li>
<li>check it really exists</li>
<li>check to see if it is a directory</li>
</ul>
<p>If you set this option, rclone will not do the HEAD request. This will mean that directory listings are much quicker, but rclone won't have the times or sizes of any files, and some files that don't exist may be in the listing.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: no_head</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_HTTP_NO_HEAD</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="http-description">--http-description</h4>
<p>Description of the remote.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: description</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_HTTP_DESCRIPTION</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="backend-commands-7">Backend commands</h2>
<p>Here are the commands specific to the http backend.</p>
<p>Run them with</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend COMMAND remote:</code></pre>
<p>The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/">backend</a> command for more info on how to pass options and arguments.</p>
<p>These can be run on a running backend using the rc command <a href="https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command">backend/command</a>.</p>
<h3 id="set-3">set</h3>
<p>Set command for updating the config parameters.</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend set remote: [options] [&lt;arguments&gt;+]</code></pre>
<p>This set command can be used to update the config parameters for a running http backend.</p>
<p>Usage Examples:</p>
<pre><code>rclone backend set remote: [-o opt_name=opt_value] [-o opt_name2=opt_value2]
rclone rc backend/command command=set fs=remote: [-o opt_name=opt_value] [-o opt_name2=opt_value2]
rclone rc backend/command command=set fs=remote: -o url=https://example.com</code></pre>
<p>The option keys are named as they are in the config file.</p>
<p>This rebuilds the connection to the http backend when it is called with the new parameters. Only new parameters need be passed as the values will default to those currently in use.</p>
<p>It doesn't return anything.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-19">Limitations</h2>
<p><code>rclone about</code> is not supported by the HTTP backend. Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy <code>mfs</code> (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.</p>

<h1 id="internet-archive">Internet Archive</h1>
<p>The Internet Archive backend utilizes Items on <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a></p>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://archive.org/services/docs/api/ias3.html">IAS3 API documentation</a> for the API this backend uses.</p>
<p>Paths are specified as <code>remote:bucket</code> (or <code>remote:</code> for the <code>lsd</code> command.) You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. <code>remote:item/path/to/dir</code>.</p>
<p>Unlike S3, listing up all items uploaded by you isn't supported.</p>
<p>Once you have made a remote, you can use it like this:</p>
<p>Make a new item</p>
<pre><code>rclone mkdir remote:item</code></pre>
<p>List the contents of a item</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:item</code></pre>
<p>Sync <code>/home/local/directory</code> to the remote item, deleting any excess files in the item.</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:item</code></pre>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Because of Internet Archive's architecture, it enqueues write operations (and extra post-processings) in a per-item queue. You can check item's queue at https://catalogd.archive.org/history/item-name-here . Because of that, all uploads/deletes will not show up immediately and takes some time to be available. The per-item queue is enqueued to an another queue, Item Deriver Queue. <a href="https://catalogd.archive.org/catalog.php?whereami=1">You can check the status of Item Deriver Queue here.</a> This queue has a limit, and it may block you from uploading, or even deleting. You should avoid uploading a lot of small files for better behavior.</p>
<p>You can optionally wait for the server's processing to finish, by setting non-zero value to <code>wait_archive</code> key. By making it wait, rclone can do normal file comparison. Make sure to set a large enough value (e.g. <code>30m0s</code> for smaller files) as it can take a long time depending on server's queue.</p>
<h2 id="about-metadata">About metadata</h2>
<p>This backend supports setting, updating and reading metadata of each file. The metadata will appear as file metadata on Internet Archive. However, some fields are reserved by both Internet Archive and rclone.</p>
<p>The following are reserved by Internet Archive: - <code>name</code> - <code>source</code> - <code>size</code> - <code>md5</code> - <code>crc32</code> - <code>sha1</code> - <code>format</code> - <code>old_version</code> - <code>viruscheck</code> - <code>summation</code></p>
<p>Trying to set values to these keys is ignored with a warning. Only setting <code>mtime</code> is an exception. Doing so make it the identical behavior as setting ModTime.</p>
<p>rclone reserves all the keys starting with <code>rclone-</code>. Setting value for these keys will give you warnings, but values are set according to request.</p>
<p>If there are multiple values for a key, only the first one is returned. This is a limitation of rclone, that supports one value per one key. It can be triggered when you did a server-side copy.</p>
<p>Reading metadata will also provide custom (non-standard nor reserved) ones.</p>
<h2 id="filtering-auto-generated-files">Filtering auto generated files</h2>
<p>The Internet Archive automatically creates metadata files after upload. These can cause problems when doing an <code>rclone sync</code> as rclone will try, and fail, to delete them. These metadata files are not changeable, as they are created by the Internet Archive automatically.</p>
<p>These auto-created files can be excluded from the sync using <a href="https://rclone.org/filtering/#metadata">metadata filtering</a>.</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync ... --metadata-exclude &quot;source=metadata&quot; --metadata-exclude &quot;format=Metadata&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Which excludes from the sync any files which have the <code>source=metadata</code> or <code>format=Metadata</code> flags which are added to Internet Archive auto-created files.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-27">Configuration</h2>
<p>Here is an example of making an internetarchive configuration. Most applies to the other providers as well, any differences are described <a href="#providers">below</a>.</p>
<p>First run</p>

<h1 id="jottacloud">Jottacloud</h1>
<p>Jottacloud is a cloud storage service provider from a Norwegian company, using its own datacenters in Norway. In addition to the official service at <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/">jottacloud.com</a>, it also provides white-label solutions to different companies, such as: * Telia * Telia Cloud (cloud.telia.se) * Telia Sky (sky.telia.no) * Tele2 * Tele2 Cloud (mittcloud.tele2.se) * Onlime * Onlime Cloud Storage (onlime.dk) * Elkjøp (with subsidiaries): * Elkjøp Cloud (cloud.elkjop.no) * Elgiganten Sweden (cloud.elgiganten.se) * Elgiganten Denmark (cloud.elgiganten.dk) * Giganti Cloud (cloud.gigantti.fi) * ELKO Cloud (cloud.elko.is)</p>
<p>Most of the white-label versions are supported by this backend, although may require different authentication setup - described below.</p>
<p>Paths are specified as <code>remote:path</code></p>
<p>Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. <code>remote:directory/subdirectory</code>.</p>
<h2 id="authentication-types">Authentication types</h2>
<p>Some of the whitelabel versions uses a different authentication method than the official service, and you have to choose the correct one when setting up the remote.</p>
<h3 id="standard-authentication">Standard authentication</h3>
<p>The standard authentication method used by the official service (jottacloud.com), as well as some of the whitelabel services, requires you to generate a single-use personal login token from the account security settings in the service's web interface. Log in to your account, go to "Settings" and then "Security", or use the direct link presented to you by rclone when configuring the remote: <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/web/secure" class="uri">https://www.jottacloud.com/web/secure</a>. Scroll down to the section "Personal login token", and click the "Generate" button. Note that if you are using a whitelabel service you probably can't use the direct link, you need to find the same page in their dedicated web interface, and also it may be in a different location than described above.</p>
<p>To access your account from multiple instances of rclone, you need to configure each of them with a separate personal login token. E.g. you create a Jottacloud remote with rclone in one location, and copy the configuration file to a second location where you also want to run rclone and access the same remote. Then you need to replace the token for one of them, using the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_reconnect/">config reconnect</a> command, which requires you to generate a new personal login token and supply as input. If you do not do this, the token may easily end up being invalidated, resulting in both instances failing with an error message something along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>oauth2: cannot fetch token: 400 Bad Request
Response: {&quot;error&quot;:&quot;invalid_grant&quot;,&quot;error_description&quot;:&quot;Stale token&quot;}</code></pre>
<p>When this happens, you need to replace the token as described above to be able to use your remote again.</p>
<p>All personal login tokens you have taken into use will be listed in the web interface under "My logged in devices", and from the right side of that list you can click the "X" button to revoke individual tokens.</p>
<h3 id="legacy-authentication">Legacy authentication</h3>
<p>If you are using one of the whitelabel versions (e.g. from Elkjøp) you may not have the option to generate a CLI token. In this case you'll have to use the legacy authentication. To do this select yes when the setup asks for legacy authentication and enter your username and password. The rest of the setup is identical to the default setup.</p>
<h3 id="telia-cloud-authentication">Telia Cloud authentication</h3>
<p>Similar to other whitelabel versions Telia Cloud doesn't offer the option of creating a CLI token, and additionally uses a separate authentication flow where the username is generated internally. To setup rclone to use Telia Cloud, choose Telia Cloud authentication in the setup. The rest of the setup is identical to the default setup.</p>
<h3 id="tele2-cloud-authentication">Tele2 Cloud authentication</h3>
<p>As Tele2-Com Hem merger was completed this authentication can be used for former Com Hem Cloud and Tele2 Cloud customers as no support for creating a CLI token exists, and additionally uses a separate authentication flow where the username is generated internally. To setup rclone to use Tele2 Cloud, choose Tele2 Cloud authentication in the setup. The rest of the setup is identical to the default setup.</p>
<h3 id="onlime-cloud-storage-authentication">Onlime Cloud Storage authentication</h3>
<p>Onlime has sold access to Jottacloud proper, while providing localized support to Danish Customers, but have recently set up their own hosting, transferring their customers from Jottacloud servers to their own ones.</p>
<p>This, of course, necessitates using their servers for authentication, but otherwise functionality and architecture seems equivalent to Jottacloud.</p>
<p>To setup rclone to use Onlime Cloud Storage, choose Onlime Cloud authentication in the setup. The rest of the setup is identical to the default setup.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-28">Configuration</h2>
<p>Here is an example of how to make a remote called <code>remote</code> with the default setup. First run:</p>
<pre><code>rclone config</code></pre>
<p>This will guide you through an interactive setup process:</p>
<pre><code>No remotes found, make a new one?

y/e/d&gt; y</code></pre>
<p>Once configured you can then use <code>rclone</code> like this,</p>
<p>List directories in top level of your Jottacloud</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:</code></pre>
<p>List all the files in your Jottacloud</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:</code></pre>
<p>To copy a local directory to an Jottacloud directory called backup</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy /home/source remote:backup</code></pre>
<h3 id="devices-and-mountpoints">Devices and Mountpoints</h3>
<p>The official Jottacloud client registers a device for each computer you install it on, and shows them in the backup section of the user interface. For each folder you select for backup it will create a mountpoint within this device. A built-in device called Jotta is special, and contains mountpoints Archive, Sync and some others, used for corresponding features in official clients.</p>
<p>With rclone you'll want to use the standard Jotta/Archive device/mountpoint in most cases. However, you may for example want to access files from the sync or backup functionality provided by the official clients, and rclone therefore provides the option to select other devices and mountpoints during config.</p>
<p>You are allowed to create new devices and mountpoints. All devices except the built-in Jotta device are treated as backup devices by official Jottacloud clients, and the mountpoints on them are individual backup sets.</p>
<p>With the built-in Jotta device, only existing, built-in, mountpoints can be selected. In addition to the mentioned Archive and Sync, it may contain several other mountpoints such as: Latest, Links, Shared and Trash. All of these are special mountpoints with a different internal representation than the "regular" mountpoints. Rclone will only to a very limited degree support them. Generally you should avoid these, unless you know what you are doing.</p>
<h3 id="fast-list-4">--fast-list</h3>
<p>This backend supports <code>--fast-list</code> which allows you to use fewer transactions in exchange for more memory. See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list">rclone docs</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Note that the implementation in Jottacloud always uses only a single API request to get the entire list, so for large folders this could lead to long wait time before the first results are shown.</p>
<p>Note also that with rclone version 1.58 and newer, information about <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#mime-type">MIME types</a> and metadata item <a href="#metadata">utime</a> are not available when using <code>--fast-list</code>.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-11">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>Jottacloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1 second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.</p>
<p>Jottacloud supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the <code>--checksum</code> flag.</p>
<p>Note that Jottacloud requires the MD5 hash before upload so if the source does not have an MD5 checksum then the file will be cached temporarily on disk (in location given by <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#temp-dir-dir">--temp-dir</a>) before it is uploaded. Small files will be cached in memory - see the <a href="#jottacloud-md5-memory-limit">--jottacloud-md5-memory-limit</a> flag. When uploading from local disk the source checksum is always available, so this does not apply. Starting with rclone version 1.52 the same is true for encrypted remotes (in older versions the crypt backend would not calculate hashes for uploads from local disk, so the Jottacloud backend had to do it as described above).</p>

<h3 id="deleting-files-3">Deleting files</h3>
<p>By default, rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files. They will be permanently deleted automatically after 30 days. You may bypass the trash and permanently delete files immediately by using the <a href="#jottacloud-hard-delete">--jottacloud-hard-delete</a> flag, or set the equivalent environment variable. Emptying the trash is supported by the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_cleanup/">cleanup</a> command.</p>
<h3 id="versions-3">Versions</h3>
<p>Jottacloud supports file versioning. When rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a new version of it. Currently rclone only supports retrieving the current version but older versions can be accessed via the Jottacloud Website.</p>
<p>Versioning can be disabled by <code>--jottacloud-no-versions</code> option. This is achieved by deleting the remote file prior to uploading a new version. If the upload the fails no version of the file will be available in the remote.</p>
<h3 id="quota-information-1">Quota information</h3>
<p>To view your current quota you can use the <code>rclone about remote:</code> command which will display your usage limit (unless it is unlimited) and the current usage.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-20">Limitations</h2>
<p>Note that Jottacloud is case insensitive so you can't have a file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".</p>
<p>There are quite a few characters that can't be in Jottacloud file names. Rclone will map these names to and from an identical looking unicode equivalent. For example if a file has a ? in it will be mapped to ？ instead.</p>
<p>Jottacloud only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-3">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Jottacloud exhibits some inconsistent behaviours regarding deleted files and folders which may cause Copy, Move and DirMove operations to previously deleted paths to fail. Emptying the trash should help in such cases.</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/">Mail.ru Cloud</a> is a cloud storage provided by a Russian internet company <a href="https://mail.ru">Mail.Ru Group</a>. The official desktop client is <a href="https://disk-o.cloud/en">Disk-O:</a>, available on Windows and Mac OS.</p>
<h2 id="features-highlights">Features highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. <code>remote:directory/subdirectory</code></li>
<li>Files have a <code>last modified time</code> property, directories don't</li>
<li>Deleted files are by default moved to the trash</li>
<li>Files and directories can be shared via public links</li>
<li>Partial uploads or streaming are not supported, file size must be known before upload</li>
<li>Maximum file size is limited to 2G for a free account, unlimited for paid accounts</li>
<li>Storage keeps hash for all files and performs transparent deduplication, the hash algorithm is a modified SHA1</li>
<li>If a particular file is already present in storage, one can quickly submit file hash instead of long file upload (this optimization is supported by rclone)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="configuration-31">Configuration</h2>
<p>Here is an example of making a mailru configuration.</p>
<p>First create a Mail.ru Cloud account and choose a tariff.</p>
<p>You will need to log in and create an app password for rclone. Rclone <strong>will not work</strong> with your normal username and password - it will give an error like <code>oauth2: server response missing access_token</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on your user icon in the top right</li>
<li>Go to Security / "Пароль и безопасность"</li>
<li>Click password for apps / "Пароли для внешних приложений"</li>
<li>Add the password - give it a name - eg "rclone"</li>
<li>Select the permissions level. For some reason just "Full access to Cloud" (WebDav) doesn't work for Rclone currently. You have to select "Full access to Mail, Cloud and Calendar" (all protocols). (<a href="https://forum.rclone.org/t/failed-to-create-file-system-for-mailru-failed-to-authorize-oauth2-invalid-username-or-password-username-or-password-is-incorrect/49298">thread on forum.rclone.org</a>)</li>
<li>Copy the password and use this password below - your normal login password won't work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now run</p>
<pre><code>rclone config</code></pre>
<p>This will guide you through an interactive setup process:</p>

<p>Configuration of this backend does not require a local web browser. You can use the configured backend as shown below:</p>
<p>See top level directories</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:</code></pre>
<p>Make a new directory</p>
<pre><code>rclone mkdir remote:directory</code></pre>
<p>List the contents of a directory</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:directory</code></pre>
<p>Sync <code>/home/local/directory</code> to the remote path, deleting any excess files in the path.</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:directory</code></pre>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-12">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>Files support a modification time attribute with up to 1 second precision. Directories do not have a modification time, which is shown as "Jan 1 1970".</p>
<p>File hashes are supported, with a custom Mail.ru algorithm based on SHA1. If file size is less than or equal to the SHA1 block size (20 bytes), its hash is simply its data right-padded with zero bytes. Hashes of a larger file is computed as a SHA1 of the file data bytes concatenated with a decimal representation of the data length.</p>
<h3 id="emptying-trash-1">Emptying Trash</h3>
<p>Removing a file or directory actually moves it to the trash, which is not visible to rclone but can be seen in a web browser. The trashed file still occupies part of total quota. If you wish to empty your trash and free some quota, you can use the <code>rclone cleanup remote:</code> command, which will permanently delete all your trashed files. This command does not take any path arguments.</p>
<h3 id="quota-information-2">Quota information</h3>
<p>To view your current quota you can use the <code>rclone about remote:</code> command which will display your usage limit (quota) and the current usage.</p>

<h4 id="mailru-speedup-enable">--mailru-speedup-enable</h4>
<p>Skip full upload if there is another file with same data hash.</p>
<p>This feature is called "speedup" or "put by hash". It is especially efficient in case of generally available files like popular books, video or audio clips, because files are searched by hash in all accounts of all mailru users. It is meaningless and ineffective if source file is unique or encrypted. Please note that rclone may need local memory and disk space to calculate content hash in advance and decide whether full upload is required. Also, if rclone does not know file size in advance (e.g. in case of streaming or partial uploads), it will not even try this optimization.</p>

<p>File size limits depend on your account. A single file size is limited by 2G for a free account and unlimited for paid tariffs. Please refer to the Mail.ru site for the total uploaded size limits.</p>
<p>Note that Mailru is case insensitive so you can't have a file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".</p>
<h1 id="mega-1">Mega</h1>
<p><a href="https://mega.nz/">Mega</a> is a cloud storage and file hosting service known for its security feature where all files are encrypted locally before they are uploaded. This prevents anyone (including employees of Mega) from accessing the files without knowledge of the key used for encryption.</p>
<p>This is an rclone backend for Mega which supports the file transfer features of Mega using the same client side encryption.</p>
<p>Paths are specified as <code>remote:path</code></p>
<p>Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. <code>remote:directory/subdirectory</code>.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-32">Configuration</h2>
<p>Here is an example of how to make a remote called <code>remote</code>. First run:</p>

<h3 id="duplicated-files-4">Duplicated files</h3>
<p>Mega can have two files with exactly the same name and path (unlike a normal file system).</p>

<h3 id="failure-to-log-in">Failure to log-in</h3>
<h4 id="object-not-found">Object not found</h4>
<p>If you are connecting to your Mega remote for the first time, to test access and synchronization, you may receive an error such as</p>
<pre><code>Failed to create file system for &quot;my-mega-remote:&quot;: 
couldn&#39;t login: Object (typically, node or user) not found</code></pre>
<p>The diagnostic steps often recommended in the <a href="https://forum.rclone.org/search?q=mega">rclone forum</a> start with the <strong>MEGAcmd</strong> utility. Note that this refers to the official C++ command from https://github.com/meganz/MEGAcmd and not the go language built command from t3rm1n4l/megacmd that is no longer maintained.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions for installing MEGAcmd and try accessing your remote as they recommend. You can establish whether or not you can log in using MEGAcmd, and obtain diagnostic information to help you, and search or work with others in the forum.</p>
<pre><code>MEGA CMD&gt; login me@example.com
Password:
Fetching nodes ...
Loading transfers from local cache
Login complete as me@example.com
me@example.com:/$ </code></pre>
<p>Note that some have found issues with passwords containing special characters. If you can not log on with rclone, but MEGAcmd logs on just fine, then consider changing your password temporarily to pure alphanumeric characters, in case that helps.</p>
<h4 id="repeated-commands-blocks-access">Repeated commands blocks access</h4>
<p>Mega remotes seem to get blocked (reject logins) under "heavy use". We haven't worked out the exact blocking rules but it seems to be related to fast paced, successive rclone commands.</p>
<p>For example, executing this command 90 times in a row <code>rclone link remote:file</code> will cause the remote to become "blocked". This is not an abnormal situation, for example if you wish to get the public links of a directory with hundred of files... After more or less a week, the remote will remote accept rclone logins normally again.</p>
<p>You can mitigate this issue by mounting the remote it with <code>rclone mount</code>. This will log-in when mounting and a log-out when unmounting only. You can also run <code>rclone rcd</code> and then use <code>rclone rc</code> to run the commands over the API to avoid logging in each time.</p>
<p>Rclone does not currently close mega sessions (you can see them in the web interface), however closing the sessions does not solve the issue.</p>
<p>If you space rclone commands by 3 seconds it will avoid blocking the remote. We haven't identified the exact blocking rules, so perhaps one could execute the command 80 times without waiting and avoid blocking by waiting 3 seconds, then continuing...</p>
<p>Note that this has been observed by trial and error and might not be set in stone.</p>
<p>Other tools seem not to produce this blocking effect, as they use a different working approach (state-based, using sessionIDs instead of log-in) which isn't compatible with the current stateless rclone approach.</p>
<p>Note that once blocked, the use of other tools (such as megacmd) is not a sure workaround: following megacmd login times have been observed in succession for blocked remote: 7 minutes, 20 min, 30min, 30 min, 30min. Web access looks unaffected though.</p>
<p>Investigation is continuing in relation to workarounds based on timeouts, pacers, retrials and tpslimits - if you discover something relevant, please post on the forum.</p>
<p>So, if rclone was working nicely and suddenly you are unable to log-in and you are sure the user and the password are correct, likely you have got the remote blocked for a while.</p>

<h4 id="mega-use-https">--mega-use-https</h4>
<p>Use HTTPS for transfers.</p>
<p>MEGA uses plain text HTTP connections by default. Some ISPs throttle HTTP connections, this causes transfers to become very slow. Enabling this will force MEGA to use HTTPS for all transfers. HTTPS is normally not necessary since all data is already encrypted anyway. Enabling it will increase CPU usage and add network overhead.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>

<h3 id="process-killed-1">Process <code>killed</code></h3>
<p>On accounts with large files or something else, memory usage can significantly increase when executing list/sync instructions. When running on cloud providers (like AWS with EC2), check if the instance type has sufficient memory/CPU to execute the commands. Use the resource monitoring tools to inspect after sending the commands. Look <a href="https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-with-mega-appears-to-work-only-in-some-accounts/40233/4">at this issue</a>.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-24">Limitations</h2>
<p>This backend uses the <a href="https://github.com/t3rm1n4l/go-mega">go-mega go library</a> which is an opensource go library implementing the Mega API. There doesn't appear to be any documentation for the mega protocol beyond the <a href="https://github.com/meganz/sdk">mega C++ SDK</a> source code so there are likely quite a few errors still remaining in this library.</p>
<p>Mega allows duplicate files which may confuse rclone.</p>
<h1 id="memory">Memory</h1>
<p>The memory backend is an in RAM backend. It does not persist its data - use the local backend for that.</p>
<p>The memory backend behaves like a bucket-based remote (e.g. like s3). Because it has no parameters you can just use it with the <code>:memory:</code> remote name.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-33">Configuration</h2>
<p>You can configure it as a remote like this with <code>rclone config</code> too if you want to:</p>
<pre><code>No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q&gt; n

<p>Because the memory backend isn't persistent it is most useful for testing or with an rclone server or rclone mount, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>rclone mount :memory: /mnt/tmp
rclone serve webdav :memory:
rclone serve sftp :memory:</code></pre>

<h2 id="features-2">Features</h2>
<h3 id="symlink-support">Symlink Support</h3>
<p>The Netstorage backend changes the rclone <code>--links, -l</code> behavior. When uploading, instead of creating the .rclonelink file, use the "symlink" API in order to create the corresponding symlink on the remote. The .rclonelink file will not be created, the upload will be intercepted and only the symlink file that matches the source file name with no suffix will be created on the remote.</p>
<p>This will effectively allow commands like copy/copyto, move/moveto and sync to upload from local to remote and download from remote to local directories with symlinks. Due to internal rclone limitations, it is not possible to upload an individual symlink file to any remote backend. You can always use the "backend symlink" command to create a symlink on the NetStorage server, refer to "symlink" section below.</p>
<p>Individual symlink files on the remote can be used with the commands like "cat" to print the destination name, or "delete" to delete symlink, or copy, copy/to and move/moveto to download from the remote to local. Note: individual symlink files on the remote should be specified including the suffix .rclonelink.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: No file with the suffix .rclonelink should ever exist on the server since it is not possible to actually upload/create a file with .rclonelink suffix with rclone, it can only exist if it is manually created through a non-rclone method on the remote.</p>
<h3 id="implicit-vs.-explicit-directories">Implicit vs. Explicit Directories</h3>
<p>With NetStorage, directories can exist in one of two forms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Explicit Directory</strong>. This is an actual, physical directory that you have created in a storage group.</li>
<li><strong>Implicit Directory</strong>. This refers to a directory within a path that has not been physically created. For example, during upload of a file, nonexistent subdirectories can be specified in the target path. NetStorage creates these as "implicit." While the directories aren't physically created, they exist implicitly and the noted path is connected with the uploaded file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rclone will intercept all file uploads and mkdir commands for the NetStorage remote and will explicitly issue the mkdir command for each directory in the uploading path. This will help with the interoperability with the other Akamai services such as SFTP and the Content Management Shell (CMShell). Rclone will not guarantee correctness of operations with implicit directories which might have been created as a result of using an upload API directly.</p>
<h3 id="fast-list-listr-support"><code>--fast-list</code> / ListR support</h3>
<p>NetStorage remote supports the ListR feature by using the "list" NetStorage API action to return a lexicographical list of all objects within the specified CP code, recursing into subdirectories as they're encountered.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rclone will use the ListR method for some commands by default</strong>. Commands such as <code>lsf -R</code> will use ListR by default. To disable this, include the <code>--disable listR</code> option to use the non-recursive method of listing objects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rclone will not use the ListR method for some commands</strong>. Commands such as <code>sync</code> don't use ListR by default. To force using the ListR method, include the <code>--fast-list</code> option.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are pros and cons of using the ListR method, refer to <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list">rclone documentation</a>. In general, the sync command over an existing deep tree on the remote will run faster with the "--fast-list" flag but with extra memory usage as a side effect. It might also result in higher CPU utilization but the whole task can be completed faster.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: There is a known limitation that "lsf -R" will display number of files in the directory and directory size as -1 when ListR method is used. The workaround is to pass "--disable listR" flag if these numbers are important in the output.</p>
<h3 id="purge-1">Purge</h3>
<p>NetStorage remote supports the purge feature by using the "quick-delete" NetStorage API action. The quick-delete action is disabled by default for security reasons and can be enabled for the account through the Akamai portal. Rclone will first try to use quick-delete action for the purge command and if this functionality is disabled then will fall back to a standard delete method.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Read the <a href="https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/webhelp/netstorage/netstorage-http-api-developer-guide/GUID-15836617-9F50-405A-833C-EA2556756A30.html">NetStorage Usage API</a> for considerations when using "quick-delete". In general, using quick-delete method will not delete the tree immediately and objects targeted for quick-delete may still be accessible.</p>

<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:container</code></pre>
<h3 id="fast-list-5">--fast-list</h3>
<p>This remote supports <code>--fast-list</code> which allows you to use fewer transactions in exchange for more memory. See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list">rclone docs</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-15">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>The modification time is stored as metadata on the object with the <code>mtime</code> key. It is stored using RFC3339 Format time with nanosecond precision. The metadata is supplied during directory listings so there is no performance overhead to using it.</p>
<p>If you wish to use the Azure standard <code>LastModified</code> time stored on the object as the modified time, then use the <code>--use-server-modtime</code> flag. Note that rclone can't set <code>LastModified</code>, so using the <code>--update</code> flag when syncing is recommended if using <code>--use-server-modtime</code>.</p>
<p>MD5 hashes are stored with blobs. However blobs that were uploaded in chunks only have an MD5 if the source remote was capable of MD5 hashes, e.g. the local disk.</p>
<h3 id="performance-1">Performance</h3>
<p>When uploading large files, increasing the value of <code>--azureblob-upload-concurrency</code> will increase performance at the cost of using more memory. The default of 16 is set quite conservatively to use less memory. It maybe be necessary raise it to 64 or higher to fully utilize a 1 GBit/s link with a single file transfer.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-filename-characters-18">Restricted filename characters</h3>
<p>In addition to the <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters">default restricted characters set</a> the following characters are also replaced:</p>

<h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
<p>There are a number of ways of supplying credentials for Azure Blob Storage. Rclone tries them in the order of the sections below.</p>
<h4 id="env-auth">Env Auth</h4>
<p>If the <code>env_auth</code> config parameter is <code>true</code> then rclone will pull credentials from the environment or runtime.</p>
<p>It tries these authentication methods in this order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Environment Variables</li>
<li>Managed Service Identity Credentials</li>
<li>Azure CLI credentials (as used by the az tool)</li>
</ol>
<p>These are described in the following sections</p>
<h5 id="env-auth-1.-environment-variables">Env Auth: 1. Environment Variables</h5>
<p>If <code>env_auth</code> is set and environment variables are present rclone authenticates a service principal with a secret or certificate, or a user with a password, depending on which environment variable are set. It reads configuration from these variables, in the following order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Service principal with client secret
<ul>
<li><code>AZURE_TENANT_ID</code>: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_ID</code>: the service principal's client ID</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET</code>: one of the service principal's client secrets</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Service principal with certificate
<ul>
<li><code>AZURE_TENANT_ID</code>: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_ID</code>: the service principal's client ID</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH</code>: path to a PEM or PKCS12 certificate file including the private key.</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD</code>: (optional) password for the certificate file.</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_SEND_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN</code>: (optional) Specifies whether an authentication request will include an x5c header to support subject name / issuer based authentication. When set to "true" or "1", authentication requests include the x5c header.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>User with username and password
<ul>
<li><code>AZURE_TENANT_ID</code>: (optional) tenant to authenticate in. Defaults to "organizations".</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_ID</code>: client ID of the application the user will authenticate to</li>
<li><code>AZURE_USERNAME</code>: a username (usually an email address)</li>
<li><code>AZURE_PASSWORD</code>: the user's password</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Workload Identity
<ul>
<li><code>AZURE_TENANT_ID</code>: Tenant to authenticate in.</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_ID</code>: Client ID of the application the user will authenticate to.</li>
<li><code>AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE</code>: Path to projected service account token file.</li>
<li><code>AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST</code>: Authority of an Azure Active Directory endpoint (default: login.microsoftonline.com).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h5 id="env-auth-2.-managed-service-identity-credentials">Env Auth: 2. Managed Service Identity Credentials</h5>
<p>When using Managed Service Identity if the VM(SS) on which this program is running has a system-assigned identity, it will be used by default. If the resource has no system-assigned but exactly one user-assigned identity, the user-assigned identity will be used by default.</p>
<p>If the resource has multiple user-assigned identities you will need to unset <code>env_auth</code> and set <code>use_msi</code> instead. See the <a href="#use_msi"><code>use_msi</code> section</a>.</p>
<p>If you are operating in disconnected clouds, or private clouds such as Azure Stack you may want to set <code>disable_instance_discovery = true</code>. This determines whether rclone requests Microsoft Entra instance metadata from <code>https://login.microsoft.com/</code> before authenticating. Setting this to <code>true</code> will skip this request, making you responsible for ensuring the configured authority is valid and trustworthy.</p>
<h5 id="env-auth-3.-azure-cli-credentials-as-used-by-the-az-tool">Env Auth: 3. Azure CLI credentials (as used by the az tool)</h5>
<p>Credentials created with the <code>az</code> tool can be picked up using <code>env_auth</code>.</p>
<p>For example if you were to login with a service principal like this:</p>
<pre><code>az login --service-principal -u XXX -p XXX --tenant XXX</code></pre>
<p>Then you could access rclone resources like this:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf :azureblob,env_auth,account=ACCOUNT:CONTAINER</code></pre>
<p>Or</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf --azureblob-env-auth --azureblob-account=ACCOUNT :azureblob:CONTAINER</code></pre>
<p>Which is analogous to using the <code>az</code> tool:</p>
<pre><code>az storage blob list --container-name CONTAINER --account-name ACCOUNT --auth-mode login</code></pre>
<h4 id="account-and-shared-key">Account and Shared Key</h4>
<p>This is the most straight forward and least flexible way. Just fill in the <code>account</code> and <code>key</code> lines and leave the rest blank.</p>
<h4 id="sas-url">SAS URL</h4>
<p>This can be an account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL.</p>
<p>To use it leave <code>account</code> and <code>key</code> blank and fill in <code>sas_url</code>.</p>
<p>An account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL can be obtained from the Azure portal or the Azure Storage Explorer. To get a container level SAS URL right click on a container in the Azure Blob explorer in the Azure portal.</p>
<p>If you use a container level SAS URL, rclone operations are permitted only on a particular container, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls azureblob:container</code></pre>
<p>You can also list the single container from the root. This will only show the container specified by the SAS URL.</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone lsd azureblob:
container/</code></pre>
<p>Note that you can't see or access any other containers - this will fail</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls azureblob:othercontainer</code></pre>
<p>Container level SAS URLs are useful for temporarily allowing third parties access to a single container or putting credentials into an untrusted environment such as a CI build server.</p>
<h4 id="service-principal-with-client-secret">Service principal with client secret</h4>
<p>If these variables are set, rclone will authenticate with a service principal with a client secret.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tenant</code>: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.</li>
<li><code>client_id</code>: the service principal's client ID</li>
<li><code>client_secret</code>: one of the service principal's client secrets</li>
</ul>
<p>The credentials can also be placed in a file using the <code>service_principal_file</code> configuration option.</p>
<h4 id="service-principal-with-certificate">Service principal with certificate</h4>
<p>If these variables are set, rclone will authenticate with a service principal with certificate.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tenant</code>: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.</li>
<li><code>client_id</code>: the service principal's client ID</li>
<li><code>client_certificate_path</code>: path to a PEM or PKCS12 certificate file including the private key.</li>
<li><code>client_certificate_password</code>: (optional) password for the certificate file.</li>
<li><code>client_send_certificate_chain</code>: (optional) Specifies whether an authentication request will include an x5c header to support subject name / issuer based authentication. When set to "true" or "1", authentication requests include the x5c header.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NB</strong> <code>client_certificate_password</code> must be obscured - see <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/">rclone obscure</a>.</p>
<h4 id="user-with-username-and-password">User with username and password</h4>
<p>If these variables are set, rclone will authenticate with username and password.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tenant</code>: (optional) tenant to authenticate in. Defaults to "organizations".</li>
<li><code>client_id</code>: client ID of the application the user will authenticate to</li>
<li><code>username</code>: a username (usually an email address)</li>
<li><code>password</code>: the user's password</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft doesn't recommend this kind of authentication, because it's less secure than other authentication flows. This method is not interactive, so it isn't compatible with any form of multi-factor authentication, and the application must already have user or admin consent. This credential can only authenticate work and school accounts; it can't authenticate Microsoft accounts.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> <code>password</code> must be obscured - see <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/">rclone obscure</a>.</p>
<h4 id="use_msi">Managed Service Identity Credentials</h4>
<p>If <code>use_msi</code> is set then managed service identity credentials are used. This authentication only works when running in an Azure service. <code>env_auth</code> needs to be unset to use this.</p>
<p>However if you have multiple user identities to choose from these must be explicitly specified using exactly one of the <code>msi_object_id</code>, <code>msi_client_id</code>, or <code>msi_mi_res_id</code> parameters.</p>
<p>If none of <code>msi_object_id</code>, <code>msi_client_id</code>, or <code>msi_mi_res_id</code> is set, this is is equivalent to using <code>env_auth</code>.</p>
<h4 id="use_az">Azure CLI tool <code>az</code></h4>
<p>Set to use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/">Azure CLI tool <code>az</code></a> as the sole means of authentication.</p>
<p>Setting this can be useful if you wish to use the <code>az</code> CLI on a host with a System Managed Identity that you do not want to use.</p>
<p>Don't set <code>env_auth</code> at the same time.</p>
<h4 id="anonymous">Anonymous</h4>
<p>If you want to access resources with public anonymous access then set <code>account</code> only. You can do this without making an rclone config:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf :azureblob,account=ACCOUNT:CONTAINER</code></pre>

<p>Skip requesting Microsoft Entra instance metadata</p>
<p>This should be set true only by applications authenticating in disconnected clouds, or private clouds such as Azure Stack.</p>
<p>It determines whether rclone requests Microsoft Entra instance metadata from <code>https://login.microsoft.com/</code> before authenticating.</p>
<p>Setting this to true will skip this request, making you responsible for ensuring the configured authority is valid and trustworthy.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="azureblob-use-msi">--azureblob-use-msi</h4>
<p>Use a managed service identity to authenticate (only works in Azure).</p>
<p>When true, use a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/">managed service identity</a> to authenticate to Azure Storage instead of a SAS token or account key.</p>
<p>If the VM(SS) on which this program is running has a system-assigned identity, it will be used by default. If the resource has no system-assigned but exactly one user-assigned identity, the user-assigned identity will be used by default. If the resource has multiple user-assigned identities, the identity to use must be explicitly specified using exactly one of the msi_object_id, msi_client_id, or msi_mi_res_id parameters.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="azureblob-chunk-size">--azureblob-chunk-size</h4>
<p>Upload chunk size.</p>
<p>Note that this is stored in memory and there may be up to "--transfers" * "--azureblob-upload-concurrency" chunks stored at once in memory.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>

<li>Type: SizeSuffix</li>
<li>Default: 4Mi</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="azureblob-upload-concurrency">--azureblob-upload-concurrency</h4>
<p>Concurrency for multipart uploads.</p>
<p>This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded concurrently.</p>
<p>If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing this may help to speed up the transfers.</p>
<p>In tests, upload speed increases almost linearly with upload concurrency. For example to fill a gigabit pipe it may be necessary to raise this to 64. Note that this will use more memory.</p>
<p>Note that chunks are stored in memory and there may be up to "--transfers" * "--azureblob-upload-concurrency" chunks stored at once in memory.</p>

<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 16</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="azureblob-copy-cutoff">--azureblob-copy-cutoff</h4>
<p>Cutoff for switching to multipart copy.</p>
<p>Any files larger than this that need to be server-side copied will be copied in chunks of chunk_size using the put block list API.</p>
<p>Files smaller than this limit will be copied with the Copy Blob API.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: copy_cutoff</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_COPY_CUTOFF</li>
<li>Type: SizeSuffix</li>
<li>Default: 8Mi</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="azureblob-copy-concurrency">--azureblob-copy-concurrency</h4>
<p>Concurrency for multipart copy.</p>
<p>This is the number of chunks of the same file that are copied concurrently.</p>
<p>These chunks are not buffered in memory and Microsoft recommends setting this value to greater than 1000 in the azcopy documentation.</p>
<p>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-optimize#increase-concurrency</p>
<p>In tests, copy speed increases almost linearly with copy concurrency.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: copy_concurrency</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_COPY_CONCURRENCY</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 512</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="azureblob-use-copy-blob">--azureblob-use-copy-blob</h4>
<p>Whether to use the Copy Blob API when copying to the same storage account.</p>
<p>If true (the default) then rclone will use the Copy Blob API for copies to the same storage account even when the size is above the copy_cutoff.</p>
<p>Rclone assumes that the same storage account means the same config and does not check for the same storage account in different configs.</p>
<p>There should be no need to change this value.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: use_copy_blob</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_USE_COPY_BLOB</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: true</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="azureblob-list-chunk">--azureblob-list-chunk</h4>
<p>Size of blob list.</p>
<p>This sets the number of blobs requested in each listing chunk. Default is the maximum, 5000. "List blobs" requests are permitted 2 minutes per megabyte to complete. If an operation is taking longer than 2 minutes per megabyte on average, it will time out ( <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/setting-timeouts-for-blob-service-operations#exceptions-to-default-timeout-interval">source</a> ). This can be used to limit the number of blobs items to return, to avoid the time out.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: list_chunk</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_LIST_CHUNK</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 5000</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="azureblob-access-tier">--azureblob-access-tier</h4>
<p>Access tier of blob: hot, cool, cold or archive.</p>
<p>Archived blobs can be restored by setting access tier to hot, cool or cold. Leave blank if you intend to use default access tier, which is set at account level</p>
<p>If there is no "access tier" specified, rclone doesn't apply any tier. rclone performs "Set Tier" operation on blobs while uploading, if objects are not modified, specifying "access tier" to new one will have no effect. If blobs are in "archive tier" at remote, trying to perform data transfer operations from remote will not be allowed. User should first restore by tiering blob to "Hot", "Cool" or "Cold".</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: access_tier</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ACCESS_TIER</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="azureblob-archive-tier-delete">--azureblob-archive-tier-delete</h4>
<p>Delete archive tier blobs before overwriting.</p>
<p>Archive tier blobs cannot be updated. So without this flag, if you attempt to update an archive tier blob, then rclone will produce the error:</p>
<pre><code>can&#39;t update archive tier blob without --azureblob-archive-tier-delete</code></pre>
<p>With this flag set then before rclone attempts to overwrite an archive tier blob, it will delete the existing blob before uploading its replacement. This has the potential for data loss if the upload fails (unlike updating a normal blob) and also may cost more since deleting archive tier blobs early may be chargable.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: archive_tier_delete</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ARCHIVE_TIER_DELETE</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="azureblob-disable-checksum">--azureblob-disable-checksum</h4>
<p>Don't store MD5 checksum with object metadata.</p>
<p>Normally rclone will calculate the MD5 checksum of the input before uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files to start uploading.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: disable_checksum</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_DISABLE_CHECKSUM</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>

<h4 id="azureblob-directory-markers">--azureblob-directory-markers</h4>
<p>Upload an empty object with a trailing slash when a new directory is created</p>
<p>Empty folders are unsupported for bucket based remotes, this option creates an empty object ending with "/", to persist the folder.</p>
<p>This object also has the metadata "hdi_isfolder = true" to conform to the Microsoft standard.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: directory_markers</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_DIRECTORY_MARKERS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>

<h2 id="limitations-25">Limitations</h2>
<p>MD5 sums are only uploaded with chunked files if the source has an MD5 sum. This will always be the case for a local to azure copy.</p>
<p><code>rclone about</code> is not supported by the Microsoft Azure Blob storage backend. Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy <code>mfs</code> (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">List of backends that do not support rclone about</a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/">rclone about</a></p>
<h2 id="azure-storage-emulator-support">Azure Storage Emulator Support</h2>
<p>You can run rclone with the storage emulator (usually <em>azurite</em>).</p>
<p>To do this, just set up a new remote with <code>rclone config</code> following the instructions in the introduction and set <code>use_emulator</code> in the advanced settings as <code>true</code>. You do not need to provide a default account name nor an account key. But you can override them in the <code>account</code> and <code>key</code> options. (Prior to v1.61 they were hard coded to <em>azurite</em>'s <code>devstoreaccount1</code>.)</p>
<p>Also, if you want to access a storage emulator instance running on a different machine, you can override the <code>endpoint</code> parameter in the advanced settings, setting it to <code>http(s)://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/devstoreaccount1</code> (e.g. <code>http://10.254.2.5:10000/devstoreaccount1</code>).</p>

<h3 id="hashes-1">Hashes</h3>
<p>MD5 hashes are stored with files. Not all files will have MD5 hashes as these have to be uploaded with the file.</p>
<h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
<p>There are a number of ways of supplying credentials for Azure Files Storage. Rclone tries them in the order of the sections below.</p>
<h4 id="env-auth-1">Env Auth</h4>
<p>If the <code>env_auth</code> config parameter is <code>true</code> then rclone will pull credentials from the environment or runtime.</p>
<p>It tries these authentication methods in this order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Environment Variables</li>
<li>Managed Service Identity Credentials</li>
<li>Azure CLI credentials (as used by the az tool)</li>
</ol>
<p>These are described in the following sections</p>
<h5 id="env-auth-1.-environment-variables-1">Env Auth: 1. Environment Variables</h5>
<p>If <code>env_auth</code> is set and environment variables are present rclone authenticates a service principal with a secret or certificate, or a user with a password, depending on which environment variable are set. It reads configuration from these variables, in the following order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Service principal with client secret
<ul>
<li><code>AZURE_TENANT_ID</code>: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_ID</code>: the service principal's client ID</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET</code>: one of the service principal's client secrets</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Service principal with certificate
<ul>
<li><code>AZURE_TENANT_ID</code>: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_ID</code>: the service principal's client ID</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH</code>: path to a PEM or PKCS12 certificate file including the private key.</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD</code>: (optional) password for the certificate file.</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_SEND_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN</code>: (optional) Specifies whether an authentication request will include an x5c header to support subject name / issuer based authentication. When set to "true" or "1", authentication requests include the x5c header.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>User with username and password
<ul>
<li><code>AZURE_TENANT_ID</code>: (optional) tenant to authenticate in. Defaults to "organizations".</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_ID</code>: client ID of the application the user will authenticate to</li>
<li><code>AZURE_USERNAME</code>: a username (usually an email address)</li>
<li><code>AZURE_PASSWORD</code>: the user's password</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Workload Identity
<ul>
<li><code>AZURE_TENANT_ID</code>: Tenant to authenticate in.</li>
<li><code>AZURE_CLIENT_ID</code>: Client ID of the application the user will authenticate to.</li>
<li><code>AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE</code>: Path to projected service account token file.</li>
<li><code>AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST</code>: Authority of an Azure Active Directory endpoint (default: login.microsoftonline.com).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h5 id="env-auth-2.-managed-service-identity-credentials-1">Env Auth: 2. Managed Service Identity Credentials</h5>
<p>When using Managed Service Identity if the VM(SS) on which this program is running has a system-assigned identity, it will be used by default. If the resource has no system-assigned but exactly one user-assigned identity, the user-assigned identity will be used by default.</p>
<p>If the resource has multiple user-assigned identities you will need to unset <code>env_auth</code> and set <code>use_msi</code> instead. See the <a href="#use_msi"><code>use_msi</code> section</a>.</p>
<p>If you are operating in disconnected clouds, or private clouds such as Azure Stack you may want to set <code>disable_instance_discovery = true</code>. This determines whether rclone requests Microsoft Entra instance metadata from <code>https://login.microsoft.com/</code> before authenticating. Setting this to <code>true</code> will skip this request, making you responsible for ensuring the configured authority is valid and trustworthy.</p>
<h5 id="env-auth-3.-azure-cli-credentials-as-used-by-the-az-tool-1">Env Auth: 3. Azure CLI credentials (as used by the az tool)</h5>
<p>Credentials created with the <code>az</code> tool can be picked up using <code>env_auth</code>.</p>
<p>For example if you were to login with a service principal like this:</p>
<pre><code>az login --service-principal -u XXX -p XXX --tenant XXX</code></pre>
<p>Then you could access rclone resources like this:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf :azurefiles,env_auth,account=ACCOUNT:</code></pre>
<p>Or</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf --azurefiles-env-auth --azurefiles-account=ACCOUNT :azurefiles:</code></pre>
<h4 id="account-and-shared-key-1">Account and Shared Key</h4>
<p>This is the most straight forward and least flexible way. Just fill in the <code>account</code> and <code>key</code> lines and leave the rest blank.</p>
<h4 id="sas-url-1">SAS URL</h4>
<p>To use it leave <code>account</code>, <code>key</code> and <code>connection_string</code> blank and fill in <code>sas_url</code>.</p>
<h4 id="connection-string">Connection String</h4>
<p>To use it leave <code>account</code>, <code>key</code> and "sas_url" blank and fill in <code>connection_string</code>.</p>
<h4 id="service-principal-with-client-secret-1">Service principal with client secret</h4>
<p>If these variables are set, rclone will authenticate with a service principal with a client secret.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tenant</code>: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.</li>
<li><code>client_id</code>: the service principal's client ID</li>
<li><code>client_secret</code>: one of the service principal's client secrets</li>
</ul>
<p>The credentials can also be placed in a file using the <code>service_principal_file</code> configuration option.</p>
<h4 id="service-principal-with-certificate-1">Service principal with certificate</h4>
<p>If these variables are set, rclone will authenticate with a service principal with certificate.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tenant</code>: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.</li>
<li><code>client_id</code>: the service principal's client ID</li>
<li><code>client_certificate_path</code>: path to a PEM or PKCS12 certificate file including the private key.</li>
<li><code>client_certificate_password</code>: (optional) password for the certificate file.</li>
<li><code>client_send_certificate_chain</code>: (optional) Specifies whether an authentication request will include an x5c header to support subject name / issuer based authentication. When set to "true" or "1", authentication requests include the x5c header.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NB</strong> <code>client_certificate_password</code> must be obscured - see <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/">rclone obscure</a>.</p>
<h4 id="user-with-username-and-password-1">User with username and password</h4>
<p>If these variables are set, rclone will authenticate with username and password.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tenant</code>: (optional) tenant to authenticate in. Defaults to "organizations".</li>
<li><code>client_id</code>: client ID of the application the user will authenticate to</li>
<li><code>username</code>: a username (usually an email address)</li>
<li><code>password</code>: the user's password</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft doesn't recommend this kind of authentication, because it's less secure than other authentication flows. This method is not interactive, so it isn't compatible with any form of multi-factor authentication, and the application must already have user or admin consent. This credential can only authenticate work and school accounts; it can't authenticate Microsoft accounts.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> <code>password</code> must be obscured - see <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/">rclone obscure</a>.</p>
<h4 id="use_msi">Managed Service Identity Credentials</h4>
<p>If <code>use_msi</code> is set then managed service identity credentials are used. This authentication only works when running in an Azure service. <code>env_auth</code> needs to be unset to use this.</p>
<p>However if you have multiple user identities to choose from these must be explicitly specified using exactly one of the <code>msi_object_id</code>, <code>msi_client_id</code>, or <code>msi_mi_res_id</code> parameters.</p>
<p>If none of <code>msi_object_id</code>, <code>msi_client_id</code>, or <code>msi_mi_res_id</code> is set, this is is equivalent to using <code>env_auth</code>.</p>
<h4 id="use_az">Azure CLI tool <code>az</code></h4>
<p>Set to use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/">Azure CLI tool <code>az</code></a> as the sole means of authentication. Setting this can be useful if you wish to use the <code>az</code> CLI on a host with a System Managed Identity that you do not want to use. Don't set <code>env_auth</code> at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="standard-options-36">Standard options</h3>

<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/remote_setup/">remote setup docs</a> for how to set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.</p>
<p>Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the token as returned from Microsoft. This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is on <code>http://127.0.0.1:53682/</code> and this it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.</p>
<p>Once configured you can then use <code>rclone</code> like this,</p>
<p>List directories in top level of your OneDrive</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:</code></pre>
<p>List all the files in your OneDrive</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:</code></pre>
<p>To copy a local directory to an OneDrive directory called backup</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy /home/source remote:backup</code></pre>
<h3 id="getting-your-own-client-id-and-key">Getting your own Client ID and Key</h3>
<p>rclone uses a default Client ID when talking to OneDrive, unless a custom <code>client_id</code> is specified in the config. The default Client ID and Key are shared by all rclone users when performing requests.</p>
<p>You may choose to create and use your own Client ID, in case the default one does not work well for you. For example, you might see throttling.</p>
<h4 id="creating-client-id-for-onedrive-personal">Creating Client ID for OneDrive Personal</h4>
<p>To create your own Client ID, please follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade and then click <code>New registration</code>.</li>
<li>Enter a name for your app, choose account type <code>Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)</code>, select <code>Web</code> in <code>Redirect URI</code>, then type (do not copy and paste) <code>http://localhost:53682/</code> and click Register. Copy and keep the <code>Application (client) ID</code> under the app name for later use.</li>
<li>Under <code>manage</code> select <code>Certificates &amp; secrets</code>, click <code>New client secret</code>. Enter a description (can be anything) and set <code>Expires</code> to 24 months. Copy and keep that secret <em>Value</em> for later use (you <em>won't</em> be able to see this value afterwards).</li>
<li>Under <code>manage</code> select <code>API permissions</code>, click <code>Add a permission</code> and select <code>Microsoft Graph</code> then select <code>delegated permissions</code>.</li>
<li>Search and select the following permissions: <code>Files.Read</code>, <code>Files.ReadWrite</code>, <code>Files.Read.All</code>, <code>Files.ReadWrite.All</code>, <code>offline_access</code>, <code>User.Read</code> and <code>Sites.Read.All</code> (if custom access scopes are configured, select the permissions accordingly). Once selected click <code>Add permissions</code> at the bottom.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the application is complete. Run <code>rclone config</code> to create or edit a OneDrive remote. Supply the app ID and password as Client ID and Secret, respectively. rclone will walk you through the remaining steps.</p>
<p>The access_scopes option allows you to configure the permissions requested by rclone. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#files-permissions">Microsoft Docs</a> for more information about the different scopes.</p>
<p>The <code>Sites.Read.All</code> permission is required if you need to <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5883">search SharePoint sites when configuring the remote</a>. However, if that permission is not assigned, you need to exclude <code>Sites.Read.All</code> from your access scopes or set <code>disable_site_permission</code> option to true in the advanced options.</p>
<h4 id="creating-client-id-for-onedrive-business">Creating Client ID for OneDrive Business</h4>
<p>The steps for OneDrive Personal may or may not work for OneDrive Business, depending on the security settings of the organization. A common error is that the publisher of the App is not verified.</p>
<p>You may try to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/publisher-verification-overview">verify you account</a>, or try to limit the App to your organization only, as shown below.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make sure to create the App with your business account.</li>
<li>Follow the steps above to create an App. However, we need a different account type here: <code>Accounts in this organizational directory only (*** - Single tenant)</code>. Note that you can also change the account type after creating the App.</li>
<li>Find the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenant">tenant ID</a> of your organization.</li>
<li>In the rclone config, set <code>auth_url</code> to <code>https://login.microsoftonline.com/YOUR_TENANT_ID/oauth2/v2.0/authorize</code>.</li>
<li>In the rclone config, set <code>token_url</code> to <code>https://login.microsoftonline.com/YOUR_TENANT_ID/oauth2/v2.0/token</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: If you have a special region, you may need a different host in step 4 and 5. Here are <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/bc23bf11db1c78c6ebbf8ea538fbebf7058b4176/backend/onedrive/onedrive.go#L86">some hints</a>.</p>
<h3 id="using-oauth-client-credential-flow">Using OAuth Client Credential flow</h3>
<p>OAuth Client Credential flow will allow rclone to use permissions directly associated with the Azure AD Enterprise application, rather that adopting the context of an Azure AD user account.</p>
<p>This flow can be enabled by following the steps below:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create the Enterprise App registration in the Azure AD portal and obtain a Client ID and Client Secret as described above.</li>
<li>Ensure that the application has the appropriate permissions and they are assigned as <em>Application Permissions</em></li>
<li>Configure the remote, ensuring that <em>Client ID</em> and <em>Client Secret</em> are entered correctly.</li>
<li>In the <em>Advanced Config</em> section, enter <code>true</code> for <code>client_credentials</code> and in the <code>tenant</code> section enter the tenant ID.</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to choosing the type of the connection work with the client credentials flow. In particular the "onedrive" option does not work. You can use the "sharepoint" option or if that does not find the correct drive ID type it in manually with the "driveid" option.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> Assigning permissions directly to the application means that anyone with the <em>Client ID</em> and <em>Client Secret</em> can access your OneDrive files. Take care to safeguard these credentials.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-16">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>OneDrive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1 second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.</p>
<p>OneDrive Personal, OneDrive for Business and Sharepoint Server support <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/code-snippets/quickxorhash">QuickXorHash</a>.</p>
<p>Before rclone 1.62 the default hash for Onedrive Personal was <code>SHA1</code>. For rclone 1.62 and above the default for all Onedrive backends is <code>QuickXorHash</code>.</p>
<p>Starting from July 2023 <code>SHA1</code> support is being phased out in Onedrive Personal in favour of <code>QuickXorHash</code>. If necessary the <code>--onedrive-hash-type</code> flag (or <code>hash_type</code> config option) can be used to select <code>SHA1</code> during the transition period if this is important your workflow.</p>
<p>For all types of OneDrive you can use the <code>--checksum</code> flag.</p>
<h3 id="fast-list-6">--fast-list</h3>
<p>This remote supports <code>--fast-list</code> which allows you to use fewer transactions in exchange for more memory. See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list">rclone docs</a> for more details.</p>
<p>This must be enabled with the <code>--onedrive-delta</code> flag (or <code>delta = true</code> in the config file) as it can cause performance degradation.</p>
<p>It does this by using the delta listing facilities of OneDrive which returns all the files in the remote very efficiently. This is much more efficient than listing directories recursively and is Microsoft's recommended way of reading all the file information from a drive.</p>
<p>This can be useful with <code>rclone mount</code> and <a href="https://rclone.org/rc/#vfs-refresh">rclone rc vfs/refresh recursive=true</a>) to very quickly fill the mount with information about all the files.</p>
<p>The API used for the recursive listing (<code>ListR</code>) only supports listing from the root of the drive. This will become increasingly inefficient the further away you get from the root as rclone will have to discard files outside of the directory you are using.</p>
<p>Some commands (like <code>rclone lsf -R</code>) will use <code>ListR</code> by default - you can turn this off with <code>--disable ListR</code> if you need to.</p>

<li>Same as if disable_site_permission was set to true</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="onedrive-disable-site-permission">--onedrive-disable-site-permission</h4>
<p>Disable the request for Sites.Read.All permission.</p>
<p>If set to true, you will no longer be able to search for a SharePoint site when configuring drive ID, because rclone will not request Sites.Read.All permission. Set it to true if your organization didn't assign Sites.Read.All permission to the application, and your organization disallows users to consent app permission request on their own.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: disable_site_permission</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_DISABLE_SITE_PERMISSION</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="onedrive-expose-onenote-files">--onedrive-expose-onenote-files</h4>
<p>Set to make OneNote files show up in directory listings.</p>
<p>By default, rclone will hide OneNote files in directory listings because operations like "Open" and "Update" won't work on them. But this behaviour may also prevent you from deleting them. If you want to delete OneNote files or otherwise want them to show up in directory listing, set this option.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: expose_onenote_files</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_EXPOSE_ONENOTE_FILES</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="onedrive-server-side-across-configs">--onedrive-server-side-across-configs</h4>
<p>Deprecated: use --server-side-across-configs instead.</p>
<p>Allow server-side operations (e.g. copy) to work across different onedrive configs.</p>
<p>This will work if you are copying between two OneDrive <em>Personal</em> drives AND the files to copy are already shared between them. Additionally, it should also function for a user who has access permissions both between Onedrive for <em>business</em> and <em>SharePoint</em> under the <em>same tenant</em>, and between <em>SharePoint</em> and another <em>SharePoint</em> under the <em>same tenant</em>. In other cases, rclone will fall back to normal copy (which will be slightly slower).</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: server_side_across_configs</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_SERVER_SIDE_ACROSS_CONFIGS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="onedrive-list-chunk">--onedrive-list-chunk</h4>

<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: list_chunk</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_LIST_CHUNK</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 1000</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="onedrive-no-versions">--onedrive-no-versions</h4>
<p>Remove all versions on modifying operations.</p>
<p>Onedrive for business creates versions when rclone uploads new files overwriting an existing one and when it sets the modification time.</p>
<p>These versions take up space out of the quota.</p>
<p>This flag checks for versions after file upload and setting modification time and removes all but the last version.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> Onedrive personal can't currently delete versions so don't use this flag there.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: no_versions</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_NO_VERSIONS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="onedrive-hard-delete">--onedrive-hard-delete</h4>
<p>Permanently delete files on removal.</p>
<p>Normally files will get sent to the recycle bin on deletion. Setting this flag causes them to be permanently deleted. Use with care.</p>
<p>OneDrive personal accounts do not support the permanentDelete API, it only applies to OneDrive for Business and SharePoint document libraries.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: hard_delete</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_HARD_DELETE</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="onedrive-link-type">--onedrive-link-type</h4>
<p>Set the type of the links created by the link command.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: link_type</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_LINK_TYPE</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Default: "view"</li>

<h4 id="onedrive-link-password">--onedrive-link-password</h4>
<p>Set the password for links created by the link command.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this only works with OneDrive personal paid accounts.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: link_password</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_LINK_PASSWORD</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="onedrive-hash-type">--onedrive-hash-type</h4>
<p>Specify the hash in use for the backend.</p>
<p>This specifies the hash type in use. If set to "auto" it will use the default hash which is QuickXorHash.</p>
<p>Before rclone 1.62 an SHA1 hash was used by default for Onedrive Personal. For 1.62 and later the default is to use a QuickXorHash for all onedrive types. If an SHA1 hash is desired then set this option accordingly.</p>
<p>From July 2023 QuickXorHash will be the only available hash for both OneDrive for Business and OneDrive Personal.</p>
<p>This can be set to "none" to not use any hashes.</p>
<p>If the hash requested does not exist on the object, it will be returned as an empty string which is treated as a missing hash by rclone.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: hash_type</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_HASH_TYPE</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Default: "auto"</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>"auto"

<li>None - don't use any hashes</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="onedrive-av-override">--onedrive-av-override</h4>
<p>Allows download of files the server thinks has a virus.</p>
<p>The onedrive/sharepoint server may check files uploaded with an Anti Virus checker. If it detects any potential viruses or malware it will block download of the file.</p>
<p>In this case you will see a message like this</p>
<pre><code>server reports this file is infected with a virus - use --onedrive-av-override to download anyway: Infected (name of virus): 403 Forbidden: </code></pre>
<p>If you are 100% sure you want to download this file anyway then use the --onedrive-av-override flag, or av_override = true in the config file.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: av_override</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_AV_OVERRIDE</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="onedrive-delta">--onedrive-delta</h4>
<p>If set rclone will use delta listing to implement recursive listings.</p>
<p>If this flag is set the onedrive backend will advertise <code>ListR</code> support for recursive listings.</p>
<p>Setting this flag speeds up these things greatly:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsf -R onedrive:
rclone size onedrive:
rclone rc vfs/refresh recursive=true</code></pre>
<p><strong>However</strong> the delta listing API <strong>only</strong> works at the root of the drive. If you use it not at the root then it recurses from the root and discards all the data that is not under the directory you asked for. So it will be correct but may not be very efficient.</p>
<p>This is why this flag is not set as the default.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb if nearly all of your data is under rclone's root directory (the <code>root/directory</code> in <code>onedrive:root/directory</code>) then using this flag will be be a big performance win. If your data is mostly not under the root then using this flag will be a big performance loss.</p>
<p>It is recommended if you are mounting your onedrive at the root (or near the root when using crypt) and using rclone <code>rc vfs/refresh</code>.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: delta</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_DELTA</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="onedrive-metadata-permissions">--onedrive-metadata-permissions</h4>
<p>Control whether permissions should be read or written in metadata.</p>
<p>Reading permissions metadata from files can be done quickly, but it isn't always desirable to set the permissions from the metadata.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: metadata_permissions</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_METADATA_PERMISSIONS</li>
<li>Type: Bits</li>

<h3 id="metadata-14">Metadata</h3>
<p>OneDrive supports System Metadata (not User Metadata, as of this writing) for both files and directories. Much of the metadata is read-only, and there are some differences between OneDrive Personal and Business (see table below for details).</p>
<p>Permissions are also supported, if <code>--onedrive-metadata-permissions</code> is set. The accepted values for <code>--onedrive-metadata-permissions</code> are "<code>read</code>", "<code>write</code>", "<code>read,write</code>", and "<code>off</code>" (the default). "<code>write</code>" supports adding new permissions, updating the "role" of existing permissions, and removing permissions. Updating and removing require the Permission ID to be known, so it is recommended to use "<code>read,write</code>" instead of "<code>write</code>" if you wish to update/remove permissions.</p>
<p>Permissions are read/written in JSON format using the same schema as the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/resources/permission?view=odsp-graph-online">OneDrive API</a>, which differs slightly between OneDrive Personal and Business.</p>

<p>To write permissions, pass in a "permissions" metadata key using this same format. The <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata-mapper"><code>--metadata-mapper</code></a> tool can be very helpful for this.</p>
<p>When adding permissions, an email address can be provided in the <code>User.ID</code> or <code>DisplayName</code> properties of <code>grantedTo</code> or <code>grantedToIdentities</code>. Alternatively, an ObjectID can be provided in <code>User.ID</code>. At least one valid recipient must be provided in order to add a permission for a user. Creating a Public Link is also supported, if <code>Link.Scope</code> is set to <code>"anonymous"</code>.</p>
<p>Example request to add a "read" permission with <code>--metadata-mapper</code>:</p>

<p>Note that adding a permission can fail if a conflicting permission already exists for the file/folder.</p>
<p>To update an existing permission, include both the Permission ID and the new <code>roles</code> to be assigned. <code>roles</code> is the only property that can be changed.</p>
<p>To remove permissions, pass in a blob containing only the permissions you wish to keep (which can be empty, to remove all.) Note that the <code>owner</code> role will be ignored, as it cannot be removed.</p>
<p>Note that both reading and writing permissions requires extra API calls, so if you don't need to read or write permissions it is recommended to omit <code>--onedrive-metadata-permissions</code>.</p>
<p>Metadata and permissions are supported for Folders (directories) as well as Files. Note that setting the <code>mtime</code> or <code>btime</code> on a Folder requires one extra API call on OneDrive Business only.</p>
<p>OneDrive does not currently support User Metadata. When writing metadata, only writeable system properties will be written -- any read-only or unrecognized keys passed in will be ignored.</p>
<p>TIP: to see the metadata and permissions for any file or folder, run:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsjson remote:path --stat -M --onedrive-metadata-permissions read</code></pre>
<p>Here are the possible system metadata items for the onedrive backend.</p>

<h3 id="impersonate-other-users-as-admin">Impersonate other users as Admin</h3>
<p>Unlike Google Drive and impersonating any domain user via service accounts, OneDrive requires you to authenticate as an admin account, and manually setup a remote per user you wish to impersonate.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com">Microsoft 365 Admin Center</a>, open each user you need to "impersonate" and go to the OneDrive section. There is a heading called "Get access to files", you need to click to create the link, this creates the link of the format <code>https://{tenant}-my.sharepoint.com/personal/{user_name_domain_tld}/</code> but also changes the permissions so you your admin user has access.</li>
<li>Then in powershell run the following commands:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="console"><code>Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force
Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Files
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes &quot;Files.ReadWrite.All&quot;
# Follow the steps to allow access to your admin user
# Then run this for each user you want to impersonate to get the Drive ID
Get-MgUserDefaultDrive -UserId &#39;{emailaddress}&#39;
# This will give you output of the format:
# Name     Id                                                                 DriveType CreatedDateTime
# ----     --                                                                 --------- ---------------
# OneDrive b!XYZ123                                                           business  14/10/2023 1:00:58 pm
</code></pre>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Then in rclone add a onedrive remote type, and use the <code>Type in driveID</code> with the DriveID you got in the previous step. One remote per user. It will then confirm the drive ID, and hopefully give you a message of <code>Found drive "root" of type "business"</code> and then include the URL of the format <code>https://{tenant}-my.sharepoint.com/personal/{user_name_domain_tld}/Documents</code></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="limitations-27">Limitations</h2>
<p>If you don't use rclone for 90 days the refresh token will expire. This will result in authorization problems. This is easy to fix by running the <code>rclone config reconnect remote:</code> command to get a new token and refresh token.</p>
<h3 id="naming">Naming</h3>
<p>Note that OneDrive is case insensitive so you can't have a file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".</p>
<p>There are quite a few characters that can't be in OneDrive file names. These can't occur on Windows platforms, but on non-Windows platforms they are common. Rclone will map these names to and from an identical looking unicode equivalent. For example if a file has a <code>?</code> in it will be mapped to <code>？</code> instead.</p>
<h3 id="file-sizes">File sizes</h3>
<p>The largest allowed file size is 250 GiB for both OneDrive Personal and OneDrive for Business <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/invalid-file-names-and-file-types-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us#individualfilesize">(Updated 13 Jan 2021)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="path-length">Path length</h3>
<p>The entire path, including the file name, must contain fewer than 400 characters for OneDrive, OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online. If you are encrypting file and folder names with rclone, you may want to pay attention to this limitation because the encrypted names are typically longer than the original ones.</p>
<h3 id="number-of-files">Number of files</h3>
<p>OneDrive seems to be OK with at least 50,000 files in a folder, but at 100,000 rclone will get errors listing the directory like <code>couldn’t list files: UnknownError:</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2707">#2707</a> for more info.</p>
<p>An official document about the limitations for different types of OneDrive can be found <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/invalid-file-names-and-file-types-in-onedrive-onedrive-for-business-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="versions-4">Versions</h2>
<p>Every change in a file OneDrive causes the service to create a new version of the file. This counts against a users quota. For example changing the modification time of a file creates a second version, so the file apparently uses twice the space.</p>
<p>For example the <code>copy</code> command is affected by this as rclone copies the file and then afterwards sets the modification time to match the source file which uses another version.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>rclone cleanup</code> command (see below) to remove all old versions.</p>
<p>Or you can set the <code>no_versions</code> parameter to <code>true</code> and rclone will remove versions after operations which create new versions. This takes extra transactions so only enable it if you need it.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> At the time of writing Onedrive Personal creates versions (but not for setting the modification time) but the API for removing them returns "API not found" so cleanup and <code>no_versions</code> should not be used on Onedrive Personal.</p>
<h3 id="disabling-versioning">Disabling versioning</h3>
<p>Starting October 2018, users will no longer be able to disable versioning by default. This is because Microsoft has brought an <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-OneDrive-Blog/New-Updates-to-OneDrive-and-SharePoint-Team-Site-Versioning/ba-p/204390">update</a> to the mechanism. To change this new default setting, a PowerShell command is required to be run by a SharePoint admin. If you are an admin, you can run these commands in PowerShell to change that setting:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell</code> (in case you haven't installed this already)</li>
<li><code>Import-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -DisableNameChecking</code></li>
<li><code>Connect-SPOService -Url https://YOURSITE-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential YOU@YOURSITE.COM</code> (replacing <code>YOURSITE</code>, <code>YOU</code>, <code>YOURSITE.COM</code> with the actual values; this will prompt for your credentials)</li>
<li><code>Set-SPOTenant -EnableMinimumVersionRequirement $False</code></li>
<li><code>Disconnect-SPOService</code> (to disconnect from the server)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Below are the steps for normal users to disable versioning. If you don't see the "No Versioning" option, make sure the above requirements are met.</em></p>
<p>User <a href="https://github.com/Weropol">Weropol</a> has found a method to disable versioning on OneDrive</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the settings menu by clicking on the gear symbol at the top of the OneDrive Business page.</li>
<li>Click Site settings.</li>
<li>Once on the Site settings page, navigate to Site Administration &gt; Site libraries and lists.</li>
<li>Click Customize "Documents".</li>
<li>Click General Settings &gt; Versioning Settings.</li>
<li>Under Document Version History select the option No versioning. Note: This will disable the creation of new file versions, but will not remove any previous versions. Your documents are safe.</li>
<li>Apply the changes by clicking OK.</li>
<li>Use rclone to upload or modify files. (I also use the --no-update-modtime flag)</li>
<li>Restore the versioning settings after using rclone. (Optional)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cleanup-4">Cleanup</h2>
<p>OneDrive supports <code>rclone cleanup</code> which causes rclone to look through every file under the path supplied and delete all version but the current version. Because this involves traversing all the files, then querying each file for versions it can be quite slow. Rclone does <code>--checkers</code> tests in parallel. The command also supports <code>--interactive</code>/<code>i</code> or <code>--dry-run</code> which is a great way to see what it would do.</p>
<pre><code>rclone cleanup --interactive remote:path/subdir # interactively remove all old version for path/subdir
rclone cleanup remote:path/subdir               # unconditionally remove all old version for path/subdir</code></pre>
<p><strong>NB</strong> Onedrive personal can't currently delete versions</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-4">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="excessive-throttling-or-blocked-on-sharepoint">Excessive throttling or blocked on SharePoint</h3>
<p>If you experience excessive throttling or is being blocked on SharePoint then it may help to set the user agent explicitly with a flag like this: <code>--user-agent "ISV|rclone.org|rclone/v1.55.1"</code></p>
<p>The specific details can be found in the Microsoft document: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/general-development/how-to-avoid-getting-throttled-or-blocked-in-sharepoint-online#how-to-decorate-your-http-traffic-to-avoid-throttling">Avoid getting throttled or blocked in SharePoint Online</a></p>
<h3 id="unexpected-file-sizehash-differences-on-sharepoint">Unexpected file size/hash differences on Sharepoint</h3>
<p>It is a <a href="https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs/issues/935#issuecomment-441741631">known</a> issue that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for Business) silently modifies uploaded files, mainly Office files (.docx, .xlsx, etc.), causing file size and hash checks to fail. There are also other situations that will cause OneDrive to report inconsistent file sizes. To use rclone with such affected files on Sharepoint, you may disable these checks with the following command line arguments:</p>
<pre><code>--ignore-checksum --ignore-size</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, if you have write access to the OneDrive files, it may be possible to fix this problem for certain files, by attempting the steps below. Open the web interface for <a href="https://onedrive.live.com">OneDrive</a> and find the affected files (which will be in the error messages/log for rclone). Simply click on each of these files, causing OneDrive to open them on the web. This will cause each file to be converted in place to a format that is functionally equivalent but which will no longer trigger the size discrepancy. Once all problematic files are converted you will no longer need the ignore options above.</p>
<h3 id="replacingdeleting-existing-files-on-sharepoint-gets-item-not-found">Replacing/deleting existing files on Sharepoint gets "item not found"</h3>
<p>It is a <a href="https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs/issues/1068">known</a> issue that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for Business) may return "item not found" errors when users try to replace or delete uploaded files; this seems to mainly affect Office files (.docx, .xlsx, etc.) and web files (.html, .aspx, etc.). As a workaround, you may use the <code>--backup-dir &lt;BACKUP_DIR&gt;</code> command line argument so rclone moves the files to be replaced/deleted into a given backup directory (instead of directly replacing/deleting them). For example, to instruct rclone to move the files into the directory <code>rclone-backup-dir</code> on backend <code>mysharepoint</code>, you may use:</p>
<pre><code>--backup-dir mysharepoint:rclone-backup-dir</code></pre>
<h3 id="access_denied-aadsts65005">access_denied (AADSTS65005)</h3>
<pre><code>Error: access_denied
Code: AADSTS65005
Description: Using application &#39;rclone&#39; is currently not supported for your organization [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] because it is in an unmanaged state. An administrator needs to claim ownership of the company by DNS validation of [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] before the application rclone can be provisioned.</code></pre>
<p>This means that rclone can't use the OneDrive for Business API with your account. You can't do much about it, maybe write an email to your admins.</p>
<p>However, there are other ways to interact with your OneDrive account. Have a look at the WebDAV backend: https://rclone.org/webdav/#sharepoint</p>
<h3 id="invalid_grant-aadsts50076">invalid_grant (AADSTS50076)</h3>
<pre><code>Error: invalid_grant
Code: AADSTS50076
Description: Due to a configuration change made by your administrator, or because you moved to a new location, you must use multi-factor authentication to access &#39;...&#39;.</code></pre>
<p>If you see the error above after enabling multi-factor authentication for your account, you can fix it by refreshing your OAuth refresh token. To do that, run <code>rclone config</code>, and choose to edit your OneDrive backend. Then, you don't need to actually make any changes until you reach this question: <code>Already have a token - refresh?</code>. For this question, answer <code>y</code> and go through the process to refresh your token, just like the first time the backend is configured. After this, rclone should work again for this backend.</p>
<h3 id="invalid-request-when-making-public-links">Invalid request when making public links</h3>
<p>On Sharepoint and OneDrive for Business, <code>rclone link</code> may return an "Invalid request" error. A possible cause is that the organisation admin didn't allow public links to be made for the organisation/sharepoint library. To fix the permissions as an admin, take a look at the docs: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off">1</a>, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/set-up-and-manage-access-requests-94b26e0b-2822-49d4-929a-8455698654b3">2</a>.</p>
<h3 id="can-not-access-shared-with-me-files">Can not access <code>Shared</code> with me files</h3>
<p>Shared with me files is not supported by rclone <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4062">currently</a>, but there is a workaround:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Visit <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/">https://onedrive.live.com</a></li>
<li>Right click a item in <code>Shared</code>, then click <code>Add shortcut to My files</code> in the context <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60313789/206118040-7e762b3b-aa61-41a1-8649-cc18889f3572.png" title="Screenshot (Shared with me)" alt="make_shortcut" /></li>

<p>The iOS OneDrive app introduced <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/live-photos-come-to-onedrive/ba-p/1953452">upload and storage</a> of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207310">Live Photos</a> in 2020. The usage and download of these uploaded Live Photos is unfortunately still work-in-progress and this introduces several issues when copying, synchronising and mounting – both in rclone and in the native OneDrive client on Windows.</p>
<p>The root cause can easily be seen if you locate one of your Live Photos in the OneDrive web interface. Then download the photo from the web interface. You will then see that the size of downloaded .heic file is smaller than the size displayed in the web interface. The downloaded file is smaller because it only contains a single frame (still photo) extracted from the Live Photo (movie) stored in OneDrive.</p>
<p>The different sizes will cause <code>rclone copy/sync</code> to repeatedly recopy unmodified photos something like this:</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG : 20230203_123826234_iOS.heic: Sizes differ (src 4470314 vs dst 1298667)
DEBUG : 20230203_123826234_iOS.heic: sha1 = fc2edde7863b7a7c93ca6771498ac797f8460750 OK
INFO  : 20230203_123826234_iOS.heic: Copied (replaced existing)</code></pre>
<p>These recopies can be worked around by adding <code>--ignore-size</code>. Please note that this workaround only syncs the still-picture not the movie clip, and relies on modification dates being correctly updated on all files in all situations.</p>
<p>The different sizes will also cause <code>rclone check</code> to report size errors something like this:</p>
<pre><code>ERROR : 20230203_123826234_iOS.heic: sizes differ</code></pre>
<p>These check errors can be suppressed by adding <code>--ignore-size</code>.</p>
<p>The different sizes will also cause <code>rclone mount</code> to fail downloading with an error something like this:</p>
<pre><code>ERROR : 20230203_123826234_iOS.heic: ReadFileHandle.Read error: low level retry 1/10: unexpected EOF</code></pre>
<p>or like this when using <code>--cache-mode=full</code>:</p>

<h2 id="limitations-28">Limitations</h2>
<p>Note that OpenDrive is case insensitive so you can't have a file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".</p>
<p>There are quite a few characters that can't be in OpenDrive file names. These can't occur on Windows platforms, but on non-Windows platforms they are common. Rclone will map these names to and from an identical looking unicode equivalent. For example if a file has a <code>?</code> in it will be mapped to <code>？</code> instead.</p>
<p><code>rclone about</code> is not supported by the OpenDrive backend. Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy <code>mfs</code> (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">List of backends that do not support rclone about</a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/">rclone about</a></p>

<h2 id="authentication-providers">Authentication Providers</h2>
<p>OCI has various authentication methods. To learn more about authentication methods please refer <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdk_authentication_methods.htm">oci authentication methods</a> These choices can be specified in the rclone config file.</p>
<p>Rclone supports the following OCI authentication provider.</p>
<pre><code>User Principal
Instance Principal
Resource Principal
Workload Identity
No authentication</code></pre>
<h3 id="user-principal">User Principal</h3>
<p>Sample rclone config file for Authentication Provider User Principal:</p>
<pre><code>[oos]
type = oracleobjectstorage
namespace = id&lt;redacted&gt;34
compartment = ocid1.compartment.oc1..aa&lt;redacted&gt;ba
region = us-ashburn-1
provider = user_principal_auth
config_file = /home/opc/.oci/config
config_profile = Default</code></pre>
<p>Advantages: - One can use this method from any server within OCI or on-premises or from other cloud provider.</p>
<p>Considerations: - you need to configure user’s privileges / policy to allow access to object storage - Overhead of managing users and keys. - If the user is deleted, the config file will no longer work and may cause automation regressions that use the user's credentials.</p>
<h3 id="instance-principal">Instance Principal</h3>
<p>An OCI compute instance can be authorized to use rclone by using it's identity and certificates as an instance principal. With this approach no credentials have to be stored and managed.</p>
<p>Sample rclone configuration file for Authentication Provider Instance Principal:</p>
<pre><code>[opc@rclone ~]$ cat ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
[oos]
type = oracleobjectstorage
namespace = id&lt;redacted&gt;fn
compartment = ocid1.compartment.oc1..aa&lt;redacted&gt;k7a
region = us-ashburn-1
provider = instance_principal_auth</code></pre>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>With instance principals, you don't need to configure user credentials and transfer/ save it to disk in your compute instances or rotate the credentials.</li>
<li>You don’t need to deal with users and keys.</li>
<li>Greatly helps in automation as you don't have to manage access keys, user private keys, storing them in vault, using kms etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to configure a dynamic group having this instance as member and add policy to read object storage to that dynamic group.</li>
<li>Everyone who has access to this machine can execute the CLI commands.</li>
<li>It is applicable for oci compute instances only. It cannot be used on external instance or resources.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="resource-principal">Resource Principal</h3>
<p>Resource principal auth is very similar to instance principal auth but used for resources that are not compute instances such as <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Concepts/functionsoverview.htm">serverless functions</a>. To use resource principal ensure Rclone process is started with these environment variables set in its process.</p>
<pre><code>export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_VERSION=2.2
export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_REGION=us-ashburn-1
export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_PRIVATE_PEM=/usr/share/model-server/key.pem
export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_RPST=/usr/share/model-server/security_token</code></pre>
<p>Sample rclone configuration file for Authentication Provider Resource Principal:</p>
<pre><code>[oos]
type = oracleobjectstorage
namespace = id&lt;redacted&gt;34
compartment = ocid1.compartment.oc1..aa&lt;redacted&gt;ba
region = us-ashburn-1
provider = resource_principal_auth</code></pre>
<h3 id="workload-identity">Workload Identity</h3>
<p>Workload Identity auth may be used when running Rclone from Kubernetes pod on a Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) cluster. For more details on configuring Workload Identity, see <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contenggrantingworkloadaccesstoresources.htm">Granting Workloads Access to OCI Resources</a>. To use workload identity, ensure Rclone is started with these environment variables set in its process.</p>
<pre><code>export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_VERSION=2.2
export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_REGION=us-ashburn-1</code></pre>
<h3 id="no-authentication">No authentication</h3>
<p>Public buckets do not require any authentication mechanism to read objects. Sample rclone configuration file for No authentication:</p>
<pre><code>[oos]
type = oracleobjectstorage
namespace = id&lt;redacted&gt;34
compartment = ocid1.compartment.oc1..aa&lt;redacted&gt;ba
region = us-ashburn-1
provider = no_auth</code></pre>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-18">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>The modification time is stored as metadata on the object as <code>opc-meta-mtime</code> as floating point since the epoch, accurate to 1 ns.</p>
<p>If the modification time needs to be updated rclone will attempt to perform a server side copy to update the modification if the object can be copied in a single part. In the case the object is larger than 5Gb, the object will be uploaded rather than copied.</p>
<p>Note that reading this from the object takes an additional <code>HEAD</code> request as the metadata isn't returned in object listings.</p>
<p>The MD5 hash algorithm is supported.</p>
<h3 id="multipart-uploads-2">Multipart uploads</h3>
<p>rclone supports multipart uploads with OOS which means that it can upload files bigger than 5 GiB.</p>
<p>Note that files uploaded <em>both</em> with multipart upload <em>and</em> through crypt remotes do not have MD5 sums.</p>
<p>rclone switches from single part uploads to multipart uploads at the point specified by <code>--oos-upload-cutoff</code>. This can be a maximum of 5 GiB and a minimum of 0 (ie always upload multipart files).</p>
<p>The chunk sizes used in the multipart upload are specified by <code>--oos-chunk-size</code> and the number of chunks uploaded concurrently is specified by <code>--oos-upload-concurrency</code>.</p>
<p>Multipart uploads will use <code>--transfers</code> * <code>--oos-upload-concurrency</code> * <code>--oos-chunk-size</code> extra memory. Single part uploads to not use extra memory.</p>
<p>Single part transfers can be faster than multipart transfers or slower depending on your latency from oos - the more latency, the more likely single part transfers will be faster.</p>
<p>Increasing <code>--oos-upload-concurrency</code> will increase throughput (8 would be a sensible value) and increasing <code>--oos-chunk-size</code> also increases throughput (16M would be sensible). Increasing either of these will use more memory. The default values are high enough to gain most of the possible performance without using too much memory.</p>

<p>Here are the Advanced options specific to oracleobjectstorage (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage).</p>
<h4 id="oos-storage-tier">--oos-storage-tier</h4>
<p>The storage class to use when storing new objects in storage. https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Concepts/understandingstoragetiers.htm</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: storage_tier</li>

<h4 id="oos-upload-cutoff">--oos-upload-cutoff</h4>
<p>Cutoff for switching to chunked upload.</p>
<p>Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of chunk_size. The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: upload_cutoff</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_OOS_UPLOAD_CUTOFF</li>
<li>Type: SizeSuffix</li>
<li>Default: 200Mi</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="oos-chunk-size">--oos-chunk-size</h4>
<p>Chunk size to use for uploading.</p>
<p>When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff or files with unknown size (e.g. from "rclone rcat" or uploaded with "rclone mount" they will be uploaded as multipart uploads using this chunk size.</p>
<p>Note that "upload_concurrency" chunks of this size are buffered in memory per transfer.</p>
<p>If you are transferring large files over high-speed links and you have enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.</p>
<p>Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a large file of known size to stay below the 10,000 chunks limit.</p>
<p>Files of unknown size are uploaded with the configured chunk_size. Since the default chunk size is 5 MiB and there can be at most 10,000 chunks, this means that by default the maximum size of a file you can stream upload is 48 GiB. If you wish to stream upload larger files then you will need to increase chunk_size.</p>
<p>Increasing the chunk size decreases the accuracy of the progress statistics displayed with "-P" flag.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: chunk_size</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_OOS_CHUNK_SIZE</li>
<li>Type: SizeSuffix</li>
<li>Default: 5Mi</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="oos-max-upload-parts">--oos-max-upload-parts</h4>
<p>Maximum number of parts in a multipart upload.</p>
<p>This option defines the maximum number of multipart chunks to use when doing a multipart upload.</p>
<p>OCI has max parts limit of 10,000 chunks.</p>
<p>Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a large file of a known size to stay below this number of chunks limit.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: max_upload_parts</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_OOS_MAX_UPLOAD_PARTS</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 10000</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="oos-upload-concurrency">--oos-upload-concurrency</h4>
<p>Concurrency for multipart uploads.</p>
<p>This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded concurrently.</p>
<p>If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing this may help to speed up the transfers.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: upload_concurrency</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_OOS_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 10</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="oos-copy-cutoff">--oos-copy-cutoff</h4>
<p>Cutoff for switching to multipart copy.</p>
<p>Any files larger than this that need to be server-side copied will be copied in chunks of this size.</p>
<p>The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: copy_cutoff</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_OOS_COPY_CUTOFF</li>
<li>Type: SizeSuffix</li>
<li>Default: 4.656Gi</li>

<li>Config: copy_timeout</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_OOS_COPY_TIMEOUT</li>
<li>Type: Duration</li>
<li>Default: 1m0s</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="oos-disable-checksum">--oos-disable-checksum</h4>
<p>Don't store MD5 checksum with object metadata.</p>
<p>Normally rclone will calculate the MD5 checksum of the input before uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files to start uploading.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: disable_checksum</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_OOS_DISABLE_CHECKSUM</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="oos-attempt-resume-upload">--oos-attempt-resume-upload</h4>
<p>If true attempt to resume previously started multipart upload for the object. This will be helpful to speed up multipart transfers by resuming uploads from past session.</p>
<p>WARNING: If chunk size differs in resumed session from past incomplete session, then the resumed multipart upload is aborted and a new multipart upload is started with the new chunk size.</p>
<p>The flag leave_parts_on_error must be true to resume and optimize to skip parts that were already uploaded successfully.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: attempt_resume_upload</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_OOS_ATTEMPT_RESUME_UPLOAD</li>

<p>This remote supports <code>--fast-list</code> which allows you to use fewer transactions in exchange for more memory. See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list">rclone docs</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="multipart-uploads-3">Multipart uploads</h3>
<p>rclone supports multipart uploads with QingStor which means that it can upload files bigger than 5 GiB. Note that files uploaded with multipart upload don't have an MD5SUM.</p>
<p>Note that incomplete multipart uploads older than 24 hours can be removed with <code>rclone cleanup remote:bucket</code> just for one bucket <code>rclone cleanup remote:</code> for all buckets. QingStor does not ever remove incomplete multipart uploads so it may be necessary to run this from time to time.</p>
<h3 id="buckets-and-zone">Buckets and Zone</h3>
<p>With QingStor you can list buckets (<code>rclone lsd</code>) using any zone, but you can only access the content of a bucket from the zone it was created in. If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong zone, you will get an error, <code>incorrect zone, the bucket is not in 'XXX' zone</code>.</p>
<h3 id="authentication-6">Authentication</h3>
<p>There are two ways to supply <code>rclone</code> with a set of QingStor credentials. In order of precedence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly in the rclone configuration file (as configured by <code>rclone config</code>)
<ul>
<li>set <code>access_key_id</code> and <code>secret_access_key</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Runtime configuration:
<ul>
<li>set <code>env_auth</code> to <code>true</code> in the config file</li>
<li>Exporting the following environment variables before running <code>rclone</code>
<ul>
<li>Access Key ID: <code>QS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> or <code>QS_ACCESS_KEY</code></li>
<li>Secret Access Key: <code>QS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code> or <code>QS_SECRET_KEY</code></li>

<h3 id="advanced-options-41">Advanced options</h3>
<p>Here are the Advanced options specific to qingstor (QingCloud Object Storage).</p>
<h4 id="qingstor-connection-retries">--qingstor-connection-retries</h4>
<p>Number of connection retries.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: connection_retries</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_CONNECTION_RETRIES</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 3</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="qingstor-upload-cutoff">--qingstor-upload-cutoff</h4>
<p>Cutoff for switching to chunked upload.</p>
<p>Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of chunk_size. The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: upload_cutoff</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_UPLOAD_CUTOFF</li>
<li>Type: SizeSuffix</li>
<li>Default: 200Mi</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="qingstor-chunk-size">--qingstor-chunk-size</h4>
<p>Chunk size to use for uploading.</p>
<p>When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff they will be uploaded as multipart uploads using this chunk size.</p>
<p>Note that "--qingstor-upload-concurrency" chunks of this size are buffered in memory per transfer.</p>
<p>If you are transferring large files over high-speed links and you have enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: chunk_size</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_CHUNK_SIZE</li>
<li>Type: SizeSuffix</li>
<li>Default: 4Mi</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="qingstor-upload-concurrency">--qingstor-upload-concurrency</h4>
<p>Concurrency for multipart uploads.</p>
<p>This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded concurrently.</p>
<p>NB if you set this to &gt; 1 then the checksums of multipart uploads become corrupted (the uploads themselves are not corrupted though).</p>
<p>If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing this may help to speed up the transfers.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: upload_concurrency</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY</li>
<li>Type: int</li>

<p>Once configured you can then use <code>rclone</code> like this,</p>
<p>List directories in top level of your Quatrix</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:</code></pre>
<p>List all the files in your Quatrix</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:</code></pre>
<p>To copy a local directory to an Quatrix directory called backup</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy /home/source remote:backup</code></pre>
<h3 id="api-key-validity">API key validity</h3>
<p>API Key is created with no expiration date. It will be valid until you delete or deactivate it in your account. After disabling, the API Key can be enabled back. If the API Key was deleted and a new key was created, you can update it in rclone config. The same happens if the hostname was changed.</p>

<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-19">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>Quatrix allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1 microsecond. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.</p>
<p>Quatrix does not support hashes, so you cannot use the <code>--checksum</code> flag.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-filename-characters-23">Restricted filename characters</h3>
<p>File names in Quatrix are case sensitive and have limitations like the maximum length of a filename is 255, and the minimum length is 1. A file name cannot be equal to <code>.</code> or <code>..</code> nor contain <code>/</code> , <code>\</code> or non-printable ascii.</p>
<h3 id="transfers-4">Transfers</h3>
<p>For files above 50 MiB rclone will use a chunked transfer. Rclone will upload up to <code>--transfers</code> chunks at the same time (shared among all multipart uploads). Chunks are buffered in memory, and the minimal chunk size is 10_000_000 bytes by default, and it can be changed in the advanced configuration, so increasing <code>--transfers</code> will increase the memory use. The chunk size has a maximum size limit, which is set to 100_000_000 bytes by default and can be changed in the advanced configuration. The size of the uploaded chunk will dynamically change depending on the upload speed. The total memory use equals the number of transfers multiplied by the minimal chunk size. In case there's free memory allocated for the upload (which equals the difference of <code>maximal_summary_chunk_size</code> and <code>minimal_chunk_size</code> * <code>transfers</code>), the chunk size may increase in case of high upload speed. As well as it can decrease in case of upload speed problems. If no free memory is available, all chunks will equal <code>minimal_chunk_size</code>.</p>
<h3 id="deleting-files-5">Deleting files</h3>
<p>Files you delete with rclone will end up in Trash and be stored there for 30 days. Quatrix also provides an API to permanently delete files and an API to empty the Trash so that you can remove files permanently from your account.</p>
<h3 id="standard-options-41">Standard options</h3>

<h2 id="storage-usage">Storage usage</h2>
<p>The storage usage in Quatrix is restricted to the account during the purchase. You can restrict any user with a smaller storage limit. The account limit is applied if the user has no custom storage limit. Once you've reached the limit, the upload of files will fail. This can be fixed by freeing up the space or increasing the quota.</p>
<h2 id="server-side-operations">Server-side operations</h2>
<p>Quatrix supports server-side operations (copy and move). In case of conflict, files are overwritten during server-side operation.</p>
<h1 id="sia">Sia</h1>
<p>Sia (<a href="https://sia.tech/">sia.tech</a>) is a decentralized cloud storage platform based on the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a> technology. With rclone you can use it like any other remote filesystem or mount Sia folders locally. The technology behind it involves a number of new concepts such as Siacoins and Wallet, Blockchain and Consensus, Renting and Hosting, and so on. If you are new to it, you'd better first familiarize yourself using their excellent <a href="https://support.sia.tech/">support documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h2>
<p>Before you can use rclone with Sia, you will need to have a running copy of <code>Sia-UI</code> or <code>siad</code> (the Sia daemon) locally on your computer or on local network (e.g. a NAS). Please follow the <a href="https://sia.tech/get-started">Get started</a> guide and install one.</p>
<p>rclone interacts with Sia network by talking to the Sia daemon via <a href="https://sia.tech/docs/">HTTP API</a> which is usually available on port <em>9980</em>. By default you will run the daemon locally on the same computer so it's safe to leave the API password blank (the API URL will be <code>http://127.0.0.1:9980</code> making external access impossible).</p>
<p>However, if you want to access Sia daemon running on another node, for example due to memory constraints or because you want to share single daemon between several rclone and Sia-UI instances, you'll need to make a few more provisions: - Ensure you have <em>Sia daemon</em> installed directly or in a <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/siad/pkgs/container/siad">docker container</a> because Sia-UI does not support this mode natively. - Run it on externally accessible port, for example provide <code>--api-addr :9980</code> and <code>--disable-api-security</code> arguments on the daemon command line. - Enforce API password for the <code>siad</code> daemon via environment variable <code>SIA_API_PASSWORD</code> or text file named <code>apipassword</code> in the daemon directory. - Set rclone backend option <code>api_password</code> taking it from above locations.</p>
<p>Notes: 1. If your wallet is locked, rclone cannot unlock it automatically. You should either unlock it in advance by using Sia-UI or via command line <code>siac wallet unlock</code>. Alternatively you can make <code>siad</code> unlock your wallet automatically upon startup by running it with environment variable <code>SIA_WALLET_PASSWORD</code>. 2. If <code>siad</code> cannot find the <code>SIA_API_PASSWORD</code> variable or the <code>apipassword</code> file in the <code>SIA_DIR</code> directory, it will generate a random password and store in the text file named <code>apipassword</code> under <code>YOUR_HOME/.sia/</code> directory on Unix or <code>C:\Users\YOUR_HOME\AppData\Local\Sia\apipassword</code> on Windows. Remember this when you configure password in rclone. 3. The only way to use <code>siad</code> without API password is to run it <strong>on localhost</strong> with command line argument <code>--authorize-api=false</code>, but this is insecure and <strong>strongly discouraged</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-42">Configuration</h2>
<p>Here is an example of how to make a <code>sia</code> remote called <code>mySia</code>. First, run:</p>
<pre><code> rclone config</code></pre>
<p>This will guide you through an interactive setup process:</p>
<pre><code>No remotes found, make a new one?

<p>This remote is called <code>remote</code> and can now be used like this</p>
<p>See all containers</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:</code></pre>
<p>Make a new container</p>
<pre><code>rclone mkdir remote:container</code></pre>
<p>List the contents of a container</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:container</code></pre>

<h3 id="configuration-from-an-openstack-credentials-file">Configuration from an OpenStack credentials file</h3>
<p>An OpenStack credentials file typically looks something something like this (without the comments)</p>
<pre><code>export OS_AUTH_URL=https://a.provider.net/v2.0
export OS_TENANT_ID=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
export OS_TENANT_NAME=&quot;1234567890123456&quot;
export OS_USERNAME=&quot;123abc567xy&quot;
echo &quot;Please enter your OpenStack Password: &quot;
read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
export OS_REGION_NAME=&quot;SBG1&quot;
if [ -z &quot;$OS_REGION_NAME&quot; ]; then unset OS_REGION_NAME; fi</code></pre>
<p>The config file needs to look something like this where <code>$OS_USERNAME</code> represents the value of the <code>OS_USERNAME</code> variable - <code>123abc567xy</code> in the example above.</p>
<pre><code>[remote]
type = swift
user = $OS_USERNAME
key = $OS_PASSWORD
auth = $OS_AUTH_URL
tenant = $OS_TENANT_NAME</code></pre>
<p>Note that you may (or may not) need to set <code>region</code> too - try without first.</p>
<h3 id="configuration-from-the-environment">Configuration from the environment</h3>
<p>If you prefer you can configure rclone to use swift using a standard set of OpenStack environment variables.</p>
<p>When you run through the config, make sure you choose <code>true</code> for <code>env_auth</code> and leave everything else blank.</p>
<p>rclone will then set any empty config parameters from the environment using standard OpenStack environment variables. There is <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/ncw/swift#Connection.ApplyEnvironment">a list of the variables</a> in the docs for the swift library.</p>
<h3 id="using-an-alternate-authentication-method">Using an alternate authentication method</h3>
<p>If your OpenStack installation uses a non-standard authentication method that might not be yet supported by rclone or the underlying swift library, you can authenticate externally (e.g. calling manually the <code>openstack</code> commands to get a token). Then, you just need to pass the two configuration variables <code>auth_token</code> and <code>storage_url</code>. If they are both provided, the other variables are ignored. rclone will not try to authenticate but instead assume it is already authenticated and use these two variables to access the OpenStack installation.</p>
<h4 id="using-rclone-without-a-config-file">Using rclone without a config file</h4>
<p>You can use rclone with swift without a config file, if desired, like this:</p>
<pre><code>source openstack-credentials-file
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_TYPE=swift
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_ENV_AUTH=true
rclone lsd myremote:</code></pre>
<h3 id="fast-list-8">--fast-list</h3>
<p>This remote supports <code>--fast-list</code> which allows you to use fewer transactions in exchange for more memory. See the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list">rclone docs</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="update-and---use-server-modtime">--update and --use-server-modtime</h3>
<p>As noted below, the modified time is stored on metadata on the object. It is used by default for all operations that require checking the time a file was last updated. It allows rclone to treat the remote more like a true filesystem, but it is inefficient because it requires an extra API call to retrieve the metadata.</p>
<p>For many operations, the time the object was last uploaded to the remote is sufficient to determine if it is "dirty". By using <code>--update</code> along with <code>--use-server-modtime</code>, you can avoid the extra API call and simply upload files whose local modtime is newer than the time it was last uploaded.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-20">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as <code>X-Object-Meta-Mtime</code> as floating point since the epoch accurate to 1 ns.</p>
<p>This is a de facto standard (used in the official python-swiftclient amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.</p>
<p>The MD5 hash algorithm is supported.</p>

<h4 id="swift-leave-parts-on-error">--swift-leave-parts-on-error</h4>
<p>If true avoid calling abort upload on a failure.</p>
<p>It should be set to true for resuming uploads across different sessions.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: leave_parts_on_error</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SWIFT_LEAVE_PARTS_ON_ERROR</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="swift-fetch-until-empty-page">--swift-fetch-until-empty-page</h4>
<p>When paginating, always fetch unless we received an empty page.</p>
<p>Consider using this option if rclone listings show fewer objects than expected, or if repeated syncs copy unchanged objects.</p>
<p>It is safe to enable this, but rclone may make more API calls than necessary.</p>
<p>This is one of a pair of workarounds to handle implementations of the Swift API that do not implement pagination as expected. See also "partial_page_fetch_threshold".</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: fetch_until_empty_page</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SWIFT_FETCH_UNTIL_EMPTY_PAGE</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="swift-partial-page-fetch-threshold">--swift-partial-page-fetch-threshold</h4>
<p>When paginating, fetch if the current page is within this percentage of the limit.</p>
<p>Consider using this option if rclone listings show fewer objects than expected, or if repeated syncs copy unchanged objects.</p>
<p>It is safe to enable this, but rclone may make more API calls than necessary.</p>
<p>This is one of a pair of workarounds to handle implementations of the Swift API that do not implement pagination as expected. See also "fetch_until_empty_page".</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: partial_page_fetch_threshold</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SWIFT_PARTIAL_PAGE_FETCH_THRESHOLD</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 0</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="swift-chunk-size">--swift-chunk-size</h4>
<p>Above this size files will be chunked.</p>
<p>Above this size files will be chunked into a a <code>_segments</code> container or a <code>.file-segments</code> directory. (See the <code>use_segments_container</code> option for more info). Default for this is 5 GiB which is its maximum value, which means only files above this size will be chunked.</p>
<p>Rclone uploads chunked files as dynamic large objects (DLO).</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: chunk_size</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SWIFT_CHUNK_SIZE</li>
<li>Type: SizeSuffix</li>
<li>Default: 5Gi</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="swift-no-chunk">--swift-no-chunk</h4>
<p>Don't chunk files during streaming upload.</p>
<p>When doing streaming uploads (e.g. using <code>rcat</code> or <code>mount</code> with <code>--vfs-cache-mode off</code>) setting this flag will cause the swift backend to not upload chunked files.</p>
<p>This will limit the maximum streamed upload size to 5 GiB. This is useful because non chunked files are easier to deal with and have an MD5SUM.</p>
<p>Rclone will still chunk files bigger than <code>chunk_size</code> when doing normal copy operations.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: no_chunk</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SWIFT_NO_CHUNK</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="swift-no-large-objects">--swift-no-large-objects</h4>
<p>Disable support for static and dynamic large objects</p>
<p>Swift cannot transparently store files bigger than 5 GiB. There are two schemes for chunking large files, static large objects (SLO) or dynamic large objects (DLO), and the API does not allow rclone to determine whether a file is a static or dynamic large object without doing a HEAD on the object. Since these need to be treated differently, this means rclone has to issue HEAD requests for objects for example when reading checksums.</p>
<p>When <code>no_large_objects</code> is set, rclone will assume that there are no static or dynamic large objects stored. This means it can stop doing the extra HEAD calls which in turn increases performance greatly especially when doing a swift to swift transfer with <code>--checksum</code> set.</p>
<p>Setting this option implies <code>no_chunk</code> and also that no files will be uploaded in chunks, so files bigger than 5 GiB will just fail on upload.</p>
<p>If you set this option and there <strong>are</strong> static or dynamic large objects, then this will give incorrect hashes for them. Downloads will succeed, but other operations such as Remove and Copy will fail.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: no_large_objects</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SWIFT_NO_LARGE_OBJECTS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="swift-use-segments-container">--swift-use-segments-container</h4>
<p>Choose destination for large object segments</p>
<p>Swift cannot transparently store files bigger than 5 GiB and rclone will chunk files larger than <code>chunk_size</code> (default 5 GiB) in order to upload them.</p>
<p>If this value is <code>true</code> the chunks will be stored in an additional container named the same as the destination container but with <code>_segments</code> appended. This means that there won't be any duplicated data in the original container but having another container may not be acceptable.</p>
<p>If this value is <code>false</code> the chunks will be stored in a <code>.file-segments</code> directory in the root of the container. This directory will be omitted when listing the container. Some providers (eg Blomp) require this mode as creating additional containers isn't allowed. If it is desired to see the <code>.file-segments</code> directory in the root then this flag must be set to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>If this value is <code>unset</code> (the default), then rclone will choose the value to use. It will be <code>false</code> unless rclone detects any <code>auth_url</code>s that it knows need it to be <code>true</code>. In this case you'll see a message in the DEBUG log.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: use_segments_container</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SWIFT_USE_SEGMENTS_CONTAINER</li>
<li>Type: Tristate</li>
<li>Default: unset</li>

<h4 id="swift-encoding">--swift-encoding</h4>

<li>Type: Encoding</li>
<li>Default: Slash,InvalidUtf8</li>

<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limitations-31">Limitations</h2>
<p>The Swift API doesn't return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files (Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won't check or use the MD5SUM for these.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-5">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="rclone-gives-failed-to-create-file-system-for-remote-bad-request">Rclone gives Failed to create file system for "remote:": Bad Request</h3>
<p>Due to an oddity of the underlying swift library, it gives a "Bad Request" error rather than a more sensible error when the authentication fails for Swift.</p>
<p>So this most likely means your username / password is wrong. You can investigate further with the <code>--dump-bodies</code> flag.</p>
<p>This may also be caused by specifying the region when you shouldn't have (e.g. OVH).</p>
<h3 id="rclone-gives-failed-to-create-file-system-response-didnt-have-storage-url-and-auth-token">Rclone gives Failed to create file system: Response didn't have storage url and auth token</h3>
<p>This is most likely caused by forgetting to specify your tenant when setting up a swift remote.</p>
<h2 id="ovh-cloud-archive">OVH Cloud Archive</h2>
<p>To use rclone with OVH cloud archive, first use <code>rclone config</code> to set up a <code>swift</code> backend with OVH, choosing <code>pca</code> as the <code>storage_policy</code>.</p>
<h3 id="uploading-objects">Uploading Objects</h3>
<p>Uploading objects to OVH cloud archive is no different to object storage, you just simply run the command you like (move, copy or sync) to upload the objects. Once uploaded the objects will show in a "Frozen" state within the OVH control panel.</p>
<h3 id="retrieving-objects">Retrieving Objects</h3>
<p>To retrieve objects use <code>rclone copy</code> as normal. If the objects are in a frozen state then rclone will ask for them all to be unfrozen and it will wait at the end of the output with a message like the following:</p>
<p><code>2019/03/23 13:06:33 NOTICE: Received retry after error - sleeping until 2019-03-23T13:16:33.481657164+01:00 (9m59.99985121s)</code></p>
<p>Rclone will wait for the time specified then retry the copy.</p>
<h1 id="pcloud">pCloud</h1>
<p>Paths are specified as <code>remote:path</code></p>
<p>Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. <code>remote:directory/subdirectory</code>.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-44">Configuration</h2>
<p>The initial setup for pCloud involves getting a token from pCloud which you need to do in your browser. <code>rclone config</code> walks you through it.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to make a remote called <code>remote</code>. First run:</p>
<pre><code> rclone config</code></pre>
<p>This will guide you through an interactive setup process:</p>
<pre><code>No remotes found, make a new one?

e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d&gt; y</code></pre>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/remote_setup/">remote setup docs</a> for how to set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.</p>
<p>Note if you are using remote config with rclone authorize while your pcloud server is the EU region, you will need to set the hostname in 'Edit advanced config', otherwise you might get a token error.</p>
<p>Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the token as returned from pCloud. This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is on <code>http://127.0.0.1:53682/</code> and this it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.</p>
<p>Once configured you can then use <code>rclone</code> like this,</p>
<p>List directories in top level of your pCloud</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:</code></pre>
<p>List all the files in your pCloud</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:</code></pre>

<p>pCloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1 second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not. In order to set a Modification time pCloud requires the object be re-uploaded.</p>
<p>pCloud supports MD5 and SHA1 hashes in the US region, and SHA1 and SHA256 hashes in the EU region, so you can use the <code>--checksum</code> flag.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-filename-characters-25">Restricted filename characters</h3>

<p>Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8">replaced</a>, as they can't be used in JSON strings.</p>
<h3 id="deleting-files-6">Deleting files</h3>
<p>Deleted files will be moved to the trash. Your subscription level will determine how long items stay in the trash. <code>rclone cleanup</code> can be used to empty the trash.</p>
<h3 id="emptying-the-trash">Emptying the trash</h3>
<p>Due to an API limitation, the <code>rclone cleanup</code> command will only work if you set your username and password in the advanced options for this backend. Since we generally want to avoid storing user passwords in the rclone config file, we advise you to only set this up if you need the <code>rclone cleanup</code> command to work.</p>
<h3 id="root-folder-id-4">Root folder ID</h3>
<p>You can set the <code>root_folder_id</code> for rclone. This is the directory (identified by its <code>Folder ID</code>) that rclone considers to be the root of your pCloud drive.</p>
<p>Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct root to use itself.</p>
<p>However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder hierarchy.</p>
<p>In order to do this you will have to find the <code>Folder ID</code> of the directory you wish rclone to display. This will be the <code>folder</code> field of the URL when you open the relevant folder in the pCloud web interface.</p>
<p>So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like <code>https://my.pcloud.com/#page=filemanager&amp;folder=5xxxxxxxx8&amp;tpl=foldergrid</code> in the browser, then you use <code>5xxxxxxxx8</code> as the <code>root_folder_id</code> in the config.</p>

<h3 id="usage-without-account">Usage without account</h3>
<p>It is possible to gain read-only access to publicly shared directories through rclone. For this you only need a directory ID. The directory ID can be found in the URL of a shared directory, the URL will look like this <code>https://pixeldrain.com/d/abcd1234</code> where <code>abcd1234</code> is the directory ID. Directory IDs in your own filesystem can also be listed with the <code>lsf</code> command:</p>
<p><code>rclone lsf Pixeldrain: --dirs-only -Fpi</code></p>
<p>This will print directories in your <code>Pixeldrain</code> home directory and their public IDs.</p>
<p>Enter this directory ID in the rclone config and you will be able to access the directory.</p>

<p>This backend uses the <a href="https://github.com/henrybear327/Proton-API-Bridge">Proton-API-Bridge</a>, which is based on <a href="https://github.com/henrybear327/go-proton-api">go-proton-api</a>, a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/go-proton-api">official repo</a>.</p>
<p>There is no official API documentation available from Proton Drive. But, thanks to Proton open sourcing <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/go-proton-api">proton-go-api</a> and the web, iOS, and Android client codebases, we don't need to completely reverse engineer the APIs by observing the web client traffic!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/go-proton-api">proton-go-api</a> provides the basic building blocks of API calls and error handling, such as 429 exponential back-off, but it is pretty much just a barebone interface to the Proton API. For example, the encryption and decryption of the Proton Drive file are not provided in this library.</p>
<p>The Proton-API-Bridge, attempts to bridge the gap, so rclone can be built on top of this quickly. This codebase handles the intricate tasks before and after calling Proton APIs, particularly the complex encryption scheme, allowing developers to implement features for other software on top of this codebase. There are likely quite a few errors in this library, as there isn't official documentation available.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-35">Limitations</h2>
<p>put.io has rate limiting. When you hit a limit, rclone automatically retries after waiting the amount of time requested by the server.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid ever hitting these limits, you may use the <code>--tpslimit</code> flag with a low number. Note that the imposed limits may be different for different operations, and may change over time.</p>
<h1 id="proton-drive-1">Proton Drive</h1>
<p><a href="https://proton.me/drive">Proton Drive</a> is an end-to-end encrypted Swiss vault for your files that protects your data.</p>
<p>This is an rclone backend for Proton Drive which supports the file transfer features of Proton Drive using the same client-side encryption.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that Proton Drive doesn't publish its API documentation, this backend is implemented with best efforts by reading the open-sourced client source code and observing the Proton Drive traffic in the browser.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> This backend is currently in Beta. It is believed to be correct and all the integration tests pass. However the Proton Drive protocol has evolved over time there may be accounts it is not compatible with. Please <a href="https://forum.rclone.org/">post on the rclone forum</a> if you find an incompatibility.</p>
<p>Paths are specified as <code>remote:path</code></p>
<p>Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. <code>remote:directory/subdirectory</code>.</p>
<h2 id="configurations-1">Configurations</h2>
<p>Here is an example of how to make a remote called <code>remote</code>. First run:</p>
<pre><code> rclone config</code></pre>
<p>This will guide you through an interactive setup process:</p>
<pre><code>No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q&gt; n
name&gt; remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Proton Drive
   \ &quot;protondrive&quot;
[snip]
Storage&gt; protondrive
User name
user&gt; you@protonmail.com
Password.
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No leave this optional password blank
y/g/n&gt; y
Enter the password:
password:
Confirm the password:
password:
Option 2fa.
2FA code (if the account requires one)
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
2fa&gt; 123456
Remote config
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: protondrive
- user: you@protonmail.com
- pass: *** ENCRYPTED ***
Keep this &quot;remote&quot; remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d&gt; y</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Proton Drive encryption keys need to have been already generated after a regular login via the browser, otherwise attempting to use the credentials in <code>rclone</code> will fail.</p>
<p>Once configured you can then use <code>rclone</code> like this,</p>
<p>List directories in top level of your Proton Drive</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:</code></pre>
<p>List all the files in your Proton Drive</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:</code></pre>
<p>To copy a local directory to an Proton Drive directory called backup</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy /home/source remote:backup</code></pre>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-25">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>Proton Drive Bridge does not support updating modification times yet.</p>
<p>The SHA1 hash algorithm is supported.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-filename-characters-29">Restricted filename characters</h3>
<p>Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8">replaced</a>, also left and right spaces will be removed (<a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/WebClients/blob/b4eba99d241af4fdae06ff7138bd651a40ef5d3c/applications/drive/src/app/store/_links/validation.ts#L51">code reference</a>)</p>
<h3 id="duplicated-files-6">Duplicated files</h3>
<p>Proton Drive can not have two files with exactly the same name and path. If the conflict occurs, depending on the advanced config, the file might or might not be overwritten.</p>
<h3 id="mailbox-password-1"><a href="https://proton.me/support/the-difference-between-the-mailbox-password-and-login-password">Mailbox password</a></h3>
<p>Please set your mailbox password in the advanced config section.</p>
<h3 id="caching-1">Caching</h3>
<p>The cache is currently built for the case when the rclone is the only instance performing operations to the mount point. The event system, which is the proton API system that provides visibility of what has changed on the drive, is yet to be implemented, so updates from other clients won’t be reflected in the cache. Thus, if there are concurrent clients accessing the same mount point, then we might have a problem with caching the stale data.</p>

<h4 id="protondrive-original-file-size-1">--protondrive-original-file-size</h4>
<p>Return the file size before encryption</p>
<p>The size of the encrypted file will be different from (bigger than) the original file size. Unless there is a reason to return the file size after encryption is performed, otherwise, set this option to true, as features like Open() which will need to be supplied with original content size, will fail to operate properly</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: original_file_size</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_PROTONDRIVE_ORIGINAL_FILE_SIZE</li>

<p>When a file upload is cancelled or failed before completion, a draft will be created and the subsequent upload of the same file to the same location will be reported as a conflict.</p>
<p>The value can also be set by --protondrive-replace-existing-draft=true</p>
<p>If the option is set to true, the draft will be replaced and then the upload operation will restart. If there are other clients also uploading at the same file location at the same time, the behavior is currently unknown. Need to set to true for integration tests. If the option is set to false, an error "a draft exist - usually this means a file is being uploaded at another client, or, there was a failed upload attempt" will be returned, and no upload will happen.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: replace_existing_draft</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_PROTONDRIVE_REPLACE_EXISTING_DRAFT</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>

<h2 id="limitations-36">Limitations</h2>
<p>This backend uses the <a href="https://github.com/henrybear327/Proton-API-Bridge">Proton-API-Bridge</a>, which is based on <a href="https://github.com/henrybear327/go-proton-api">go-proton-api</a>, a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/go-proton-api">official repo</a>.</p>
<p>There is no official API documentation available from Proton Drive. But, thanks to Proton open sourcing <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/go-proton-api">proton-go-api</a> and the web, iOS, and Android client codebases, we don't need to completely reverse engineer the APIs by observing the web client traffic!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/go-proton-api">proton-go-api</a> provides the basic building blocks of API calls and error handling, such as 429 exponential back-off, but it is pretty much just a barebone interface to the Proton API. For example, the encryption and decryption of the Proton Drive file are not provided in this library.</p>
<p>The Proton-API-Bridge, attempts to bridge the gap, so rclone can be built on top of this quickly. This codebase handles the intricate tasks before and after calling Proton APIs, particularly the complex encryption scheme, allowing developers to implement features for other software on top of this codebase. There are likely quite a few errors in this library, as there isn't official documentation available.</p>
<h1 id="seafile">Seafile</h1>
<p>This is a backend for the <a href="https://www.seafile.com/">Seafile</a> storage service: - It works with both the free community edition or the professional edition. - Seafile versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x and 9.x are all supported. - Encrypted libraries are also supported. - It supports 2FA enabled users - Using a Library API Token is <strong>not</strong> supported</p>
<h2 id="configuration-48">Configuration</h2>
<p>There are two distinct modes you can setup your remote: - you point your remote to the <strong>root of the server</strong>, meaning you don't specify a library during the configuration: Paths are specified as <code>remote:library</code>. You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. <code>remote:library/path/to/dir</code>. - you point your remote to a specific library during the configuration: Paths are specified as <code>remote:path/to/dir</code>. <strong>This is the recommended mode when using encrypted libraries</strong>. (<em>This mode is possibly slightly faster than the root mode</em>)</p>

<h1 id="sftp">SFTP</h1>
<p>SFTP is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol">Secure (or SSH) File Transfer Protocol</a>.</p>
<p>The SFTP backend can be used with a number of different providers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hetzner Storage Box</li>
<li>rsync.net</li>
</ul>
<p>SFTP runs over SSH v2 and is installed as standard with most modern SSH installations.</p>
<p>Paths are specified as <code>remote:path</code>. If the path does not begin with a <code>/</code> it is relative to the home directory of the user. An empty path <code>remote:</code> refers to the user's home directory. For example, <code>rclone lsd remote:</code> would list the home directory of the user configured in the rclone remote config (<code>i.e /home/sftpuser</code>). However, <code>rclone lsd remote:/</code> would list the root directory for remote machine (i.e. <code>/</code>)</p>
<p>Note that some SFTP servers will need the leading / - Synology is a good example of this. rsync.net and Hetzner, on the other hand, requires users to OMIT the leading /.</p>
<p>Note that by default rclone will try to execute shell commands on the server, see <a href="#shell-access-considerations">shell access considerations</a>.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-49">Configuration</h2>

<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:</code></pre>
<p>See all directories in the root directory</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:/</code></pre>

<p>Mount the remote path <code>/srv/www-data/</code> to the local path <code>/mnt/www-data</code></p>
<pre><code>rclone mount remote:/srv/www-data/ /mnt/www-data</code></pre>
<h3 id="ssh-authentication">SSH Authentication</h3>
<p>The SFTP remote supports three authentication methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Password</li>
<li>Key file, including certificate signed keys</li>
<li>ssh-agent</li>
</ul>
<p>Key files should be PEM-encoded private key files. For instance <code>/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa</code>. Only unencrypted OpenSSH or PEM encrypted files are supported.</p>
<p>The key file can be specified in either an external file (key_file) or contained within the rclone config file (key_pem). If using key_pem in the config file, the entry should be on a single line with new line ('' or '') separating lines. i.e.</p>
<pre><code>key_pem = -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMaMbaIXtE\n0gAMbMbaSsd\nMbaass\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----</code></pre>
<p>This will generate it correctly for key_pem for use in the config:</p>
<pre><code>awk &#39;{printf &quot;%s\\n&quot;, $0}&#39; &lt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa</code></pre>
<p>If you don't specify <code>pass</code>, <code>key_file</code>, or <code>key_pem</code> or <code>ask_password</code> then rclone will attempt to contact an ssh-agent. You can also specify <code>key_use_agent</code> to force the usage of an ssh-agent. In this case <code>key_file</code> or <code>key_pem</code> can also be specified to force the usage of a specific key in the ssh-agent.</p>
<p>Using an ssh-agent is the only way to load encrypted OpenSSH keys at the moment.</p>
<p>If you set the <code>ask_password</code> option, rclone will prompt for a password when needed and no password has been configured.</p>
<h4 id="certificate-signed-keys">Certificate-signed keys</h4>
<p>With traditional key-based authentication, you configure your private key only, and the public key built into it will be used during the authentication process.</p>
<p>If you have a certificate you may use it to sign your public key, creating a separate SSH user certificate that should be used instead of the plain public key extracted from the private key. Then you must provide the path to the user certificate public key file in <code>pubkey_file</code> or the content of the file in <code>pubkey</code>.</p>
<p>Note: This is not the traditional public key paired with your private key, typically saved as <code>/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>. Setting this path in <code>pubkey_file</code> will not work.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>[remote]
type = sftp
host = example.com
user = sftpuser
key_file = ~/id_rsa
pubkey_file = ~/id_rsa-cert.pub</code></pre>
<p>If you concatenate a cert with a private key then you can specify the merged file in both places.</p>
<p>Note: the cert must come first in the file. e.g.</p>
<pre><code>cat id_rsa-cert.pub id_rsa &gt; merged_key</code></pre>
<h3 id="host-key-validation">Host key validation</h3>
<p>By default rclone will not check the server's host key for validation. This can allow an attacker to replace a server with their own and if you use password authentication then this can lead to that password being exposed.</p>
<p>Host key matching, using standard <code>known_hosts</code> files can be turned on by enabling the <code>known_hosts_file</code> option. This can point to the file maintained by <code>OpenSSH</code> or can point to a unique file.</p>
<p>e.g. using the OpenSSH <code>known_hosts</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>[remote]
type = sftp
host = example.com
user = sftpuser
pass = 
known_hosts_file = ~/.ssh/known_hosts</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively you can create your own known hosts file like this:</p>
<pre><code>ssh-keyscan -t dsa,rsa,ecdsa,ed25519 example.com &gt;&gt; known_hosts</code></pre>
<p>There are some limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rclone</code> will not <em>manage</em> this file for you. If the key is missing or wrong then the connection will be refused.</li>
<li>If the server is set up for a certificate host key then the entry in the <code>known_hosts</code> file <em>must</em> be the <code>@cert-authority</code> entry for the CA</li>
</ul>
<p>If the host key provided by the server does not match the one in the file (or is missing) then the connection will be aborted and an error returned such as</p>
<pre><code>NewFs: couldn&#39;t connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: knownhosts: key mismatch</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>NewFs: couldn&#39;t connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: knownhosts: key is unknown</code></pre>
<p>If you see an error such as</p>
<pre><code>NewFs: couldn&#39;t connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: ssh: no authorities for hostname: example.com:22</code></pre>
<p>then it is likely the server has presented a CA signed host certificate and you will need to add the appropriate <code>@cert-authority</code> entry.</p>
<p>The <code>known_hosts_file</code> setting can be set during <code>rclone config</code> as an advanced option.</p>
<h3 id="ssh-agent-on-macos">ssh-agent on macOS</h3>
<p>Note that there seem to be various problems with using an ssh-agent on macOS due to recent changes in the OS. The most effective work-around seems to be to start an ssh-agent in each session, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>eval `ssh-agent -s` &amp;&amp; ssh-add -A</code></pre>
<p>And then at the end of the session</p>
<pre><code>eval `ssh-agent -k`</code></pre>
<p>These commands can be used in scripts of course.</p>
<h3 id="shell-access">Shell access</h3>
<p>Some functionality of the SFTP backend relies on remote shell access, and the possibility to execute commands. This includes <a href="#checksum">checksum</a>, and in some cases also <a href="#about-command">about</a>. The shell commands that must be executed may be different on different type of shells, and also quoting/escaping of file path arguments containing special characters may be different. Rclone therefore needs to know what type of shell it is, and if shell access is available at all.</p>
<p>Most servers run on some version of Unix, and then a basic Unix shell can be assumed, without further distinction. Windows 10, Server 2019, and later can also run a SSH server, which is a port of OpenSSH (see official <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse">installation guide</a>). On a Windows server the shell handling is different: Although it can also be set up to use a Unix type shell, e.g. Cygwin bash, the default is to use Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe), and PowerShell is a recommended alternative. All of these have behave differently, which rclone must handle.</p>
<p>Rclone tries to auto-detect what type of shell is used on the server, first time you access the SFTP remote. If a remote shell session is successfully created, it will look for indications that it is CMD or PowerShell, with fall-back to Unix if not something else is detected. If unable to even create a remote shell session, then shell command execution will be disabled entirely. The result is stored in the SFTP remote configuration, in option <code>shell_type</code>, so that the auto-detection only have to be performed once. If you manually set a value for this option before first run, the auto-detection will be skipped, and if you set a different value later this will override any existing. Value <code>none</code> can be set to avoid any attempts at executing shell commands, e.g. if this is not allowed on the server. If you have <code>shell_type = none</code> in the configuration then the <a href="#sftp-ssh">ssh</a> must not be set.</p>
<p>When the server is <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_sftp/">rclone serve sftp</a>, the rclone SFTP remote will detect this as a Unix type shell - even if it is running on Windows. This server does not actually have a shell, but it accepts input commands matching the specific ones that the SFTP backend relies on for Unix shells, e.g. <code>md5sum</code> and <code>df</code>. Also it handles the string escape rules used for Unix shell. Treating it as a Unix type shell from a SFTP remote will therefore always be correct, and support all features.</p>
<h4 id="shell-access-considerations">Shell access considerations</h4>
<p>The shell type auto-detection logic, described above, means that by default rclone will try to run a shell command the first time a new sftp remote is accessed. If you configure a sftp remote without a config file, e.g. an <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#backend-path-to-dir%5D">on the fly</a> remote, rclone will have nowhere to store the result, and it will re-run the command on every access. To avoid this you should explicitly set the <code>shell_type</code> option to the correct value, or to <code>none</code> if you want to prevent rclone from executing any remote shell commands.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that, since the shell type decides how quoting and escaping of file paths used as command-line arguments are performed, configuring the wrong shell type may leave you exposed to command injection exploits. Make sure to confirm the auto-detected shell type, or explicitly set the shell type you know is correct, or disable shell access until you know.</p>
<h3 id="checksum-2">Checksum</h3>
<p>SFTP does not natively support checksums (file hash), but rclone is able to use checksumming if the same login has shell access, and can execute remote commands. If there is a command that can calculate compatible checksums on the remote system, Rclone can then be configured to execute this whenever a checksum is needed, and read back the results. Currently MD5 and SHA-1 are supported.</p>
<p>Normally this requires an external utility being available on the server. By default rclone will try commands <code>md5sum</code>, <code>md5</code> and <code>rclone md5sum</code> for MD5 checksums, and the first one found usable will be picked. Same with <code>sha1sum</code>, <code>sha1</code> and <code>rclone sha1sum</code> commands for SHA-1 checksums. These utilities normally need to be in the remote's PATH to be found.</p>
<p>In some cases the shell itself is capable of calculating checksums. PowerShell is an example of such a shell. If rclone detects that the remote shell is PowerShell, which means it most probably is a Windows OpenSSH server, rclone will use a predefined script block to produce the checksums when no external checksum commands are found (see <a href="#shell-access">shell access</a>). This assumes PowerShell version 4.0 or newer.</p>
<p>The options <code>md5sum_command</code> and <code>sha1_command</code> can be used to customize the command to be executed for calculation of checksums. You can for example set a specific path to where md5sum and sha1sum executables are located, or use them to specify some other tools that print checksums in compatible format. The value can include command-line arguments, or even shell script blocks as with PowerShell. Rclone has subcommands <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_md5sum/">md5sum</a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sha1sum/">sha1sum</a> that use compatible format, which means if you have an rclone executable on the server it can be used. As mentioned above, they will be automatically picked up if found in PATH, but if not you can set something like <code>/path/to/rclone md5sum</code> as the value of option <code>md5sum_command</code> to make sure a specific executable is used.</p>
<p>Remote checksumming is recommended and enabled by default. First time rclone is using a SFTP remote, if options <code>md5sum_command</code> or <code>sha1_command</code> are not set, it will check if any of the default commands for each of them, as described above, can be used. The result will be saved in the remote configuration, so next time it will use the same. Value <code>none</code> will be set if none of the default commands could be used for a specific algorithm, and this algorithm will not be supported by the remote.</p>
<p>Disabling the checksumming may be required if you are connecting to SFTP servers which are not under your control, and to which the execution of remote shell commands is prohibited. Set the configuration option <code>disable_hashcheck</code> to <code>true</code> to disable checksumming entirely, or set <code>shell_type</code> to <code>none</code> to disable all functionality based on remote shell command execution.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-26">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>Modified times are stored on the server to 1 second precision.</p>
<p>Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported.</p>
<p>Some SFTP servers disable setting/modifying the file modification time after upload (for example, certain configurations of ProFTPd with mod_sftp). If you are using one of these servers, you can set the option <code>set_modtime = false</code> in your RClone backend configuration to disable this behaviour.</p>
<h3 id="about-command">About command</h3>
<p>The <code>about</code> command returns the total space, free space, and used space on the remote for the disk of the specified path on the remote or, if not set, the disk of the root on the remote.</p>
<p>SFTP usually supports the <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/">about</a> command, but it depends on the server. If the server implements the vendor-specific VFS statistics extension, which is normally the case with OpenSSH instances, it will be used. If not, but the same login has access to a Unix shell, where the <code>df</code> command is available (e.g. in the remote's PATH), then this will be used instead. If the server shell is PowerShell, probably with a Windows OpenSSH server, rclone will use a built-in shell command (see <a href="#shell-access">shell access</a>). If none of the above is applicable, <code>about</code> will fail.</p>

<h4 id="sftp-ssh">--sftp-ssh</h4>
<p>Path and arguments to external ssh binary.</p>
<p>Normally rclone will use its internal ssh library to connect to the SFTP server. However it does not implement all possible ssh options so it may be desirable to use an external ssh binary.</p>
<p>Rclone ignores all the internal config if you use this option and expects you to configure the ssh binary with the user/host/port and any other options you need.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> The ssh command must log in without asking for a password so needs to be configured with keys or certificates.</p>
<p>Rclone will run the command supplied either with the additional arguments "-s sftp" to access the SFTP subsystem or with commands such as "md5sum /path/to/file" appended to read checksums.</p>
<p>Any arguments with spaces in should be surrounded by "double quotes".</p>
<p>An example setting might be:</p>
<pre><code>ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=20 user@example.com</code></pre>
<p>Note that when using an external ssh binary rclone makes a new ssh connection for every hash it calculates.</p>

<h3 id="advanced-options-53">Advanced options</h3>
<p>Here are the Advanced options specific to sftp (SSH/SFTP).</p>
<h4 id="sftp-known-hosts-file">--sftp-known-hosts-file</h4>
<p>Optional path to known_hosts file.</p>
<p>Set this value to enable server host key validation.</p>
<p>Leading <code>~</code> will be expanded in the file name as will environment variables such as <code>${RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR}</code>.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: known_hosts_file</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>

<li>"~/.ssh/known_hosts"
<ul>
<li>Use OpenSSH's known_hosts file.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sftp-ask-password">--sftp-ask-password</h4>
<p>Allow asking for SFTP password when needed.</p>
<p>If this is set and no password is supplied then rclone will: - ask for a password - not contact the ssh agent</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: ask_password</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_ASK_PASSWORD</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sftp-path-override">--sftp-path-override</h4>
<p>Override path used by SSH shell commands.</p>
<p>This allows checksum calculation when SFTP and SSH paths are different. This issue affects among others Synology NAS boxes.</p>
<p>E.g. if shared folders can be found in directories representing volumes:</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/directory --sftp-path-override /volume2/directory</code></pre>
<p>E.g. if home directory can be found in a shared folder called "home":</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/home/directory --sftp-path-override /volume1/homes/USER/directory</code></pre>
<p>To specify only the path to the SFTP remote's root, and allow rclone to add any relative subpaths automatically (including unwrapping/decrypting remotes as necessary), add the '@' character to the beginning of the path.</p>
<p>E.g. the first example above could be rewritten as:</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/directory --sftp-path-override @/volume2</code></pre>
<p>Note that when using this method with Synology "home" folders, the full "/homes/USER" path should be specified instead of "/home".</p>
<p>E.g. the second example above should be rewritten as:</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/homes/USER/directory --sftp-path-override @/volume1</code></pre>
<p>Properties:</p>

<h4 id="sftp-subsystem">--sftp-subsystem</h4>
<p>Specifies the SSH2 subsystem on the remote host.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: subsystem</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_SUBSYSTEM</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Default: "sftp"</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sftp-server-command">--sftp-server-command</h4>
<p>Specifies the path or command to run a sftp server on the remote host.</p>
<p>The subsystem option is ignored when server_command is defined.</p>
<p>If adding server_command to the configuration file please note that it should not be enclosed in quotes, since that will make rclone fail.</p>
<p>A working example is:</p>
<pre><code>[remote_name]
type = sftp
server_command = sudo /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server</code></pre>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: server_command</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_SERVER_COMMAND</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sftp-use-fstat">--sftp-use-fstat</h4>
<p>If set use fstat instead of stat.</p>
<p>Some servers limit the amount of open files and calling Stat after opening the file will throw an error from the server. Setting this flag will call Fstat instead of Stat which is called on an already open file handle.</p>
<p>It has been found that this helps with IBM Sterling SFTP servers which have "extractability" level set to 1 which means only 1 file can be opened at any given time.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: use_fstat</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_USE_FSTAT</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sftp-disable-concurrent-reads">--sftp-disable-concurrent-reads</h4>
<p>If set don't use concurrent reads.</p>
<p>Normally concurrent reads are safe to use and not using them will degrade performance, so this option is disabled by default.</p>
<p>Some servers limit the amount number of times a file can be downloaded. Using concurrent reads can trigger this limit, so if you have a server which returns</p>
<pre><code>Failed to copy: file does not exist</code></pre>
<p>Then you may need to enable this flag.</p>
<p>If concurrent reads are disabled, the use_fstat option is ignored.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: disable_concurrent_reads</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_DISABLE_CONCURRENT_READS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sftp-disable-concurrent-writes">--sftp-disable-concurrent-writes</h4>
<p>If set don't use concurrent writes.</p>
<p>Normally rclone uses concurrent writes to upload files. This improves the performance greatly, especially for distant servers.</p>
<p>This option disables concurrent writes should that be necessary.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: disable_concurrent_writes</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_DISABLE_CONCURRENT_WRITES</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sftp-idle-timeout">--sftp-idle-timeout</h4>
<p>Max time before closing idle connections.</p>
<p>If no connections have been returned to the connection pool in the time given, rclone will empty the connection pool.</p>
<p>Set to 0 to keep connections indefinitely.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: idle_timeout</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_IDLE_TIMEOUT</li>
<li>Type: Duration</li>
<li>Default: 1m0s</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sftp-chunk-size">--sftp-chunk-size</h4>
<p>Upload and download chunk size.</p>
<p>This controls the maximum size of payload in SFTP protocol packets. The RFC limits this to 32768 bytes (32k), which is the default. However, a lot of servers support larger sizes, typically limited to a maximum total package size of 256k, and setting it larger will increase transfer speed dramatically on high latency links. This includes OpenSSH, and, for example, using the value of 255k works well, leaving plenty of room for overhead while still being within a total packet size of 256k.</p>
<p>Make sure to test thoroughly before using a value higher than 32k, and only use it if you always connect to the same server or after sufficiently broad testing. If you get errors such as "failed to send packet payload: EOF", lots of "connection lost", or "corrupted on transfer", when copying a larger file, try lowering the value. The server run by <a href="/commands/rclone_serve_sftp">rclone serve sftp</a> sends packets with standard 32k maximum payload so you must not set a different chunk_size when downloading files, but it accepts packets up to the 256k total size, so for uploads the chunk_size can be set as for the OpenSSH example above.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: chunk_size</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_CHUNK_SIZE</li>
<li>Type: SizeSuffix</li>
<li>Default: 32Ki</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sftp-concurrency">--sftp-concurrency</h4>
<p>The maximum number of outstanding requests for one file</p>
<p>This controls the maximum number of outstanding requests for one file. Increasing it will increase throughput on high latency links at the cost of using more memory.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: concurrency</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_CONCURRENCY</li>
<li>Type: int</li>
<li>Default: 64</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sftp-connections">--sftp-connections</h4>
<p>Maximum number of SFTP simultaneous connections, 0 for unlimited.</p>
<p>Note that setting this is very likely to cause deadlocks so it should be used with care.</p>
<p>If you are doing a sync or copy then make sure connections is one more than the sum of <code>--transfers</code> and <code>--checkers</code>.</p>
<p>If you use <code>--check-first</code> then it just needs to be one more than the maximum of <code>--checkers</code> and <code>--transfers</code>.</p>
<p>So for <code>connections 3</code> you'd use <code>--checkers 2 --transfers 2 --check-first</code> or <code>--checkers 1 --transfers 1</code>.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: connections</li>

<p>Space separated list of ciphers to be used for session encryption, ordered by preference.</p>
<p>At least one must match with server configuration. This can be checked for example using ssh -Q cipher.</p>
<p>This must not be set if use_insecure_cipher is true.</p>

<h4 id="sftp-host-key-algorithms">--sftp-host-key-algorithms</h4>
<p>Space separated list of host key algorithms, ordered by preference.</p>
<p>At least one must match with server configuration. This can be checked for example using ssh -Q HostKeyAlgorithms.</p>
<p>Note: This can affect the outcome of key negotiation with the server even if server host key validation is not enabled.</p>
<p>Example:</p>

<h4 id="sftp-socks-proxy">--sftp-socks-proxy</h4>
<p>Socks 5 proxy host.</p>
<p>Supports the format user:pass@host:port, user@host:port, host:port.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>myUser:myPass@localhost:9005</code></pre>
<p>Properties:</p>

<h4 id="sftp-http-proxy">--sftp-http-proxy</h4>
<p>URL for HTTP CONNECT proxy</p>
<p>Set this to a URL for an HTTP proxy which supports the HTTP CONNECT verb.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: http_proxy</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_HTTP_PROXY</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sftp-copy-is-hardlink">--sftp-copy-is-hardlink</h4>
<p>Set to enable server side copies using hardlinks.</p>
<p>The SFTP protocol does not define a copy command so normally server side copies are not allowed with the sftp backend.</p>
<p>However the SFTP protocol does support hardlinking, and if you enable this flag then the sftp backend will support server side copies. These will be implemented by doing a hardlink from the source to the destination.</p>
<p>Not all sftp servers support this.</p>
<p>Note that hardlinking two files together will use no additional space as the source and the destination will be the same file.</p>
<p>This feature may be useful backups made with --copy-dest.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: copy_is_hardlink</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_COPY_IS_HARDLINK</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>

<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limitations-37">Limitations</h2>
<p>On some SFTP servers (e.g. Synology) the paths are different for SSH and SFTP so the hashes can't be calculated properly. You can either use <a href="#--sftp-path-override"><code>--sftp-path-override</code></a> or <a href="#--sftp-disable-hashcheck"><code>disable_hashcheck</code></a>.</p>
<p>The only ssh agent supported under Windows is Putty's pageant.</p>
<p>The Go SSH library disables the use of the aes128-cbc cipher by default, due to security concerns. This can be re-enabled on a per-connection basis by setting the <code>use_insecure_cipher</code> setting in the configuration file to <code>true</code>. Further details on the insecurity of this cipher can be found <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/SandPfinal.pdf">in this paper</a>.</p>
<p>SFTP isn't supported under plan9 until <a href="https://github.com/pkg/sftp/issues/156">this issue</a> is fixed.</p>
<p>Note that since SFTP isn't HTTP based the following flags don't work with it: <code>--dump-headers</code>, <code>--dump-bodies</code>, <code>--dump-auth</code>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--timeout</code> and <code>--contimeout</code> are both supported.</p>
<h2 id="rsync-net">rsync.net</h2>
<p>rsync.net is supported through the SFTP backend.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.rsync.net/products/rclone.html">rsync.net's documentation of rclone examples</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hetzner-storage-box">Hetzner Storage Box</h2>
<p>Hetzner Storage Boxes are supported through the SFTP backend on port 23.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/storage-box/access/access-ssh-rsync-borg#rclone">Hetzner's documentation for details</a></p>
<h1 id="smb">SMB</h1>
<p>SMB is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block">a communication protocol to share files over network</a>.</p>
<p>This relies on <a href="https://github.com/CloudSoda/go-smb2/">go-smb2 library</a> for communication with SMB protocol.</p>
<p>Paths are specified as <code>remote:sharename</code> (or <code>remote:</code> for the <code>lsd</code> command.) You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. <code>remote:item/path/to/dir</code>.</p>
<h2 id="notes-1">Notes</h2>
<p>The first path segment must be the name of the share, which you entered when you started to share on Windows. On smbd, it's the section title in <code>smb.conf</code> (usually in <code>/etc/samba/</code>) file. You can find shares by querying the root if you're unsure (e.g. <code>rclone lsd remote:</code>).</p>
<p>You can't access to the shared printers from rclone, obviously.</p>
<p>You can't use Anonymous access for logging in. You have to use the <code>guest</code> user with an empty password instead. The rclone client tries to avoid 8.3 names when uploading files by encoding trailing spaces and periods. Alternatively, <a href="https://rclone.org/local/#paths-on-windows">the local backend</a> on Windows can access SMB servers using UNC paths, by <code>\\server\share</code>. This doesn't apply to non-Windows OSes, such as Linux and macOS.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-50">Configuration</h2>
<p>Here is an example of making a SMB configuration.</p>
<p>First run</p>

<h1 id="storj-1">Storj</h1>
<p><a href="https://storj.io">Storj</a> is redefining the cloud to support the future of data—sustainably and economically. Storj leverages the vast global supply of underutilized resources to deliver better security, durability, and performance services. Experience up to 90% lower costs and carbon reduction with Storj.</p>
<p>Storj is an encrypted, secure, and cost-effective object storage service that enables you to store, back up, and archive large amounts of data in a decentralized manner.</p>
<h2 id="backend-options">Backend options</h2>
<p>Storj can be used both with this native backend and with the <a href="https://rclone.org/s3/#storj">s3 backend using the Storj S3 compatible gateway</a> (shared or private).</p>
<p>Use this backend to take advantage of client-side encryption as well as to achieve the best possible download performance. Uploads will be erasure-coded locally, thus a 1gb upload will result in 2.68gb of data being uploaded to storage nodes across the network.</p>
<p>Use the s3 backend and one of the S3 compatible Hosted Gateways to increase upload performance and reduce the load on your systems and network. Uploads will be encrypted and erasure-coded server-side, thus a 1GB upload will result in only in 1GB of data being uploaded to storage nodes across the network.</p>
<p>Side by side comparison with more details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Characteristics:
<ul>
<li><em>Storj backend</em>: Uses native RPC protocol, connects directly to the storage nodes which hosts the data. Requires more CPU resource of encoding/decoding and has network amplification (especially during the upload), uses lots of TCP connections</li>
<li><em>S3 backend</em>: Uses S3 compatible HTTP Rest API via the shared gateways. There is no network amplification, but performance depends on the shared gateways and the secret encryption key is shared with the gateway.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Typical usage:
<ul>
<li><em>Storj backend</em>: Server environments and desktops with enough resources, internet speed and connectivity - and applications where storjs client-side encryption is required.</li>
<li><em>S3 backend</em>: Desktops and similar with limited resources, internet speed or connectivity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Security:
<ul>
<li><em>Storj backend</em>: <strong>strong</strong>. Private encryption key doesn't need to leave the local computer.</li>
<li><em>S3 backend</em>: <strong>weaker</strong>. Private encryption key is <a href="https://docs.storj.io/dcs/api-reference/s3-compatible-gateway#security-and-encryption">shared with</a> the authentication service of the hosted gateway, where it's stored encrypted. It can be stronger when combining with the rclone <a href="/crypt">crypt</a> backend.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bandwidth usage (upload):
<ul>
<li><em>Storj backend</em>: <strong>higher</strong>. As data is erasure coded on the client side both the original data and the parities should be uploaded. About ~2.7 times more data is required to be uploaded. Client may start to upload with even higher number of nodes (~3.7 times more) and abandon/stop the slow uploads.</li>
<li><em>S3 backend</em>: <strong>normal</strong>. Only the raw data is uploaded, erasure coding happens on the gateway.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bandwidth usage (download)
<ul>
<li><em>Storj backend</em>: <strong>almost normal</strong>. Only the minimal number of data is required, but to avoid very slow data providers a few more sources are used and the slowest are ignored (max 1.2x overhead).</li>
<li><em>S3 backend</em>: <strong>normal</strong>. Only the raw data is downloaded, erasure coding happens on the shared gateway.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CPU usage:
<ul>
<li><em>Storj backend</em>: <strong>higher</strong>, but more predictable. Erasure code and encryption/decryption happens locally which requires significant CPU usage.</li>
<li><em>S3 backend</em>: <strong>less</strong>. Erasure code and encryption/decryption happens on shared s3 gateways (and as is, it depends on the current load on the gateways)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>TCP connection usage:
<ul>
<li><em>Storj backend</em>: <strong>high</strong>. A direct connection is required to each of the Storj nodes resulting in 110 connections on upload and 35 on download per 64 MB segment. Not all the connections are actively used (slow ones are pruned), but they are all opened. <a href="https://rclone.org/storj/#known-issues">Adjusting the max open file limit</a> may be required.</li>
<li><em>S3 backend</em>: <strong>normal</strong>. Only one connection per download/upload thread is required to the shared gateway.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Overall performance:
<ul>
<li><em>Storj backend</em>: with enough resources (CPU and bandwidth) <em>storj</em> backend can provide even 2x better performance. Data is directly downloaded to / uploaded from to the client instead of the gateway.</li>
<li><em>S3 backend</em>: Can be faster on edge devices where CPU and network bandwidth is limited as the shared S3 compatible gateways take care about the encrypting/decryption and erasure coding and no download/upload amplification.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decentralization:
<ul>
<li><em>Storj backend</em>: <strong>high</strong>. Data is downloaded directly from the distributed cloud of storage providers.</li>
<li><em>S3 backend</em>: <strong>low</strong>. Requires a running S3 gateway (either self-hosted or Storj-hosted).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Limitations:
<ul>
<li><em>Storj backend</em>: <code>rclone checksum</code> is not possible without download, as checksum metadata is not calculated during upload</li>
<li><em>S3 backend</em>: secret encryption key is shared with the gateway</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Use the <code>copy</code> command to upload an object.</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy --progress /home/local/directory/file.ext remote:bucket/path/to/dir/</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--progress</code> flag is for displaying progress information. Remove it if you don't need this information.</p>
<p>Use a folder in the local path to upload all its objects.</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy --progress /home/local/directory/ remote:bucket/path/to/dir/</code></pre>
<p>Only modified files will be copied.</p>

<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive --progress /home/local/directory/ remote:bucket/path/to/dir/</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--progress</code> flag is for displaying progress information. Remove it if you don't need this information.</p>
<p>Since this can cause data loss, test first with the <code>--dry-run</code> flag to see exactly what would be copied and deleted.</p>
<p>The sync can be done also from Storj to the local file system.</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive --progress remote:bucket/path/to/dir/ /home/local/directory/</code></pre>
<p>Or between two Storj buckets.</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive --progress remote-us:bucket/path/to/dir/ remote-europe:bucket/path/to/dir/</code></pre>
<p>Or even between another cloud storage and Storj.</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive --progress s3:bucket/path/to/dir/ storj:bucket/path/to/dir/</code></pre>
<h2 id="limitations-38">Limitations</h2>
<p><code>rclone about</code> is not supported by the rclone Storj backend. Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy <code>mfs</code> (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features">List of backends that do not support rclone about</a> and <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/">rclone about</a></p>
<h2 id="known-issues-1">Known issues</h2>
<p>If you get errors like <code>too many open files</code> this usually happens when the default <code>ulimit</code> for system max open files is exceeded. Native Storj protocol opens a large number of TCP connections (each of which is counted as an open file). For a single upload stream you can expect 110 TCP connections to be opened. For a single download stream you can expect 35. This batch of connections will be opened for every 64 MiB segment and you should also expect TCP connections to be reused. If you do many transfers you eventually open a connection to most storage nodes (thousands of nodes).</p>
<p>To fix these, please raise your system limits. You can do this issuing a <code>ulimit -n 65536</code> just before you run rclone. To change the limits more permanently you can add this to your shell startup script, e.g. <code>$HOME/.bashrc</code>, or change the system-wide configuration, usually <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> and/or <code>/etc/security/limits.conf</code>, but please refer to your operating system manual.</p>

<p>List folders in root level folder:</p>
<pre><code>rclone lsd remote:</code></pre>
<p>List all the files in your root folder:</p>
<pre><code>rclone ls remote:</code></pre>
<p>To copy a local folder to a Uloz.to folder called backup:</p>
<pre><code>rclone copy /home/source remote:backup</code></pre>
<h3 id="user-credentials">User credentials</h3>
<p>The only reliable method is to authenticate the user using username and password. Uloz.to offers an API key as well, but it's reserved for the use of Uloz.to's in-house application and using it in different circumstances is unreliable.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-and-hashes-28">Modification times and hashes</h3>
<p>Uloz.to doesn't allow the user to set a custom modification time, or retrieve the hashes after upload. As a result, the integration uses a free form field the API provides to encode client-provided timestamps and hashes. Timestamps are stored with microsecond precision.</p>
<p>A server calculated MD5 hash of the file is verified upon upload. Afterwards, the backend only serves the client-side calculated hashes. Hashes can also be retrieved upon creating a file download link, but it's impractical for <code>list</code>-like use cases.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-filename-characters-32">Restricted filename characters</h3>
<p>In addition to the <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters">default restricted characters set</a> the following characters are also replaced:</p>

<h3 id="transfers-5">Transfers</h3>
<p>All files are currently uploaded using a single HTTP request, so for uploading large files a stable connection is necessary. Rclone will upload up to <code>--transfers</code> chunks at the same time (shared among all uploads).</p>
<h3 id="deleting-files-8">Deleting files</h3>
<p>By default, files are moved to the recycle bin whereas folders are deleted immediately. Trashed files are permanently deleted after 30 days in the recycle bin.</p>
<p>Emptying the trash is currently not implemented in rclone.</p>
<h3 id="root-folder-id-5">Root folder ID</h3>
<p>You can set the <code>root_folder_slug</code> for rclone. This is the folder (identified by its <code>Folder slug</code>) that rclone considers to be the root of your Uloz.to drive.</p>
<p>Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct root to use itself. However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder hierarchy.</p>
<p>In order to do this you will have to find the <code>Folder slug</code> of the folder you wish to use as root. This will be the last segment of the URL when you open the relevant folder in the Uloz.to web interface.</p>
<p>For example, for exploring a folder with URL <code>https://uloz.to/fm/my-files/foobar</code>, <code>foobar</code> should be used as the root slug.</p>
<p><code>root_folder_slug</code> can be used alongside a specific path in the remote path. For example, if your remote's <code>root_folder_slug</code> corresponds to <code>/foo/bar</code>, <code>remote:baz/qux</code> will refer to <code>ABSOLUTE_ULOZTO_ROOT/foo/bar/baz/qux</code>.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-40">Limitations</h2>
<p>Uloz.to file names can't have the <code>\</code> character in. rclone maps this to and from an identical looking unicode equivalent <code>＼</code> (U+FF3C Fullwidth Reverse Solidus).</p>
<p>Uloz.to only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.</p>
<p>Uloz.to rate limits access to the API, but exact details are undisclosed. Practical testing reveals that hitting the rate limit during normal use is very rare, although not impossible with higher number of concurrently uploaded files.</p>
<p><code>rclone about</code> is not supported by the Uloz.to backend. Although there's an endpoint to retrieve the information for the UI, it's not exposed in the API. Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy <code>mfs</code> (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.</p>

<h1 id="union">Union</h1>
<p>The <code>union</code> backend joins several remotes together to make a single unified view of them.</p>
<p>During the initial setup with <code>rclone config</code> you will specify the upstream remotes as a space separated list. The upstream remotes can either be a local paths or other remotes.</p>
<p>The attributes <code>:ro</code>, <code>:nc</code> and <code>:writeback</code> can be attached to the end of the remote to tag the remote as <strong>read only</strong>, <strong>no create</strong> or <strong>writeback</strong>, e.g. <code>remote:directory/subdirectory:ro</code> or <code>remote:directory/subdirectory:nc</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:ro</code> means files will only be read from here and never written</li>
<li><code>:nc</code> means new files or directories won't be created here</li>
<li><code>:writeback</code> means files found in different remotes will be written back here. See the <a href="#writeback">writeback section</a> for more info.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subfolders can be used in upstream remotes. Assume a union remote named <code>backup</code> with the remotes <code>mydrive:private/backup</code>. Invoking <code>rclone mkdir backup:desktop</code> is exactly the same as invoking <code>rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/desktop</code>.</p>
<p>There is no special handling of paths containing <code>..</code> segments. Invoking <code>rclone mkdir backup:../desktop</code> is exactly the same as invoking <code>rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/../desktop</code>.</p>

<h3 id="behavior-policies">Behavior / Policies</h3>
<p>The behavior of union backend is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs">trapexit/mergerfs</a>. All functions are grouped into 3 categories: <strong>action</strong>, <strong>create</strong> and <strong>search</strong>. These functions and categories can be assigned a policy which dictates what file or directory is chosen when performing that behavior. Any policy can be assigned to a function or category though some may not be very useful in practice. For instance: <strong>rand</strong> (random) may be useful for file creation (create) but could lead to very odd behavior if used for <code>delete</code> if there were more than one copy of the file.</p>

<h3 id="writeback">Writeback</h3>
<p>The tag <code>:writeback</code> on an upstream remote can be used to make a simple cache system like this:</p>
<pre><code>[union]
type = union
action_policy = all
create_policy = all
search_policy = ff
upstreams = /local:writeback remote:dir</code></pre>
<p>When files are opened for read, if the file is in <code>remote:dir</code> but not <code>/local</code> then rclone will copy the file entirely into <code>/local</code> before returning a reference to the file in <code>/local</code>. The copy will be done with the equivalent of <code>rclone copy</code> so will use <code>--multi-thread-streams</code> if configured. Any copies will be logged with an INFO log.</p>
<p>When files are written, they will be written to both <code>remote:dir</code> and <code>/local</code>.</p>
<p>As many remotes as desired can be added to <code>upstreams</code> but there should only be one <code>:writeback</code> tag.</p>
<p>Rclone does not manage the <code>:writeback</code> remote in any way other than writing files back to it. So if you need to expire old files or manage the size then you will have to do this yourself.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-56">Configuration</h2>
<p>To configure the WebDAV remote you will need to have a URL for it, and a username and password. If you know what kind of system you are connecting to then rclone can enable extra features.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to make a remote called <code>remote</code>. First run:</p>
<pre><code> rclone config</code></pre>
<p>This will guide you through an interactive setup process:</p>
<pre><code>No remotes found, make a new one?

<h2 id="provider-notes">Provider notes</h2>
<p>See below for notes on specific providers.</p>
<h3 id="fastmail-files">Fastmail Files</h3>
<p>Use <code>https://webdav.fastmail.com/</code> or a subdirectory as the URL, and your Fastmail email <code>username@domain.tld</code> as the username. Follow <a href="https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/360058752854-App-passwords">this documentation</a> to create an app password with access to <code>Files (WebDAV)</code> and use this as the password.</p>
<p>Fastmail supports modified times using the <code>X-OC-Mtime</code> header.</p>
<h3 id="owncloud">ownCloud</h3>
<p>Click on the settings cog in the bottom right of the page and this will show the WebDAV URL that rclone needs in the config step. It will look something like <code>https://example.com/remote.php/webdav/</code>.</p>
<p>ownCloud supports modified times using the <code>X-OC-Mtime</code> header.</p>
<h3 id="nextcloud">Nextcloud</h3>
<p>This is configured in an identical way to ownCloud. Note that Nextcloud initially did not support streaming of files (<code>rcat</code>) whereas ownCloud did, but <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud-snap/issues/365">this</a> seems to be fixed as of 2020-11-27 (tested with rclone v1.53.1 and Nextcloud Server v19).</p>
<h3 id="owncloud-infinite-scale">ownCloud Infinite Scale</h3>
<p>The WebDAV URL for Infinite Scale can be found in the details panel of any space in Infinite Scale, if the display was enabled in the personal settings of the user through a checkbox there.</p>
<p>Infinite Scale works with the chunking <a href="https://tus.io">tus</a> upload protocol. The chunk size is currently fixed 10 MB.</p>
<h3 id="sharepoint-online">Sharepoint Online</h3>
<p>Rclone can be used with Sharepoint provided by OneDrive for Business or Office365 Education Accounts. This feature is only needed for a few of these Accounts, mostly Office365 Education ones. These accounts are sometimes not verified by the domain owner <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1975">github#1975</a></p>
<p>This means that these accounts can't be added using the official API (other Accounts should work with the "onedrive" option). However, it is possible to access them using webdav.</p>
<p>To use a sharepoint remote with rclone, add it like this: First, you need to get your remote's URL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/signin/">here</a> to open your OneDrive or to sign in</li>
<li>Now take a look at your address bar, the URL should look like this: <code>https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You'll only need this URL up to the email address. After that, you'll most likely want to add "/Documents". That subdirectory contains the actual data stored on your OneDrive.</p>
<p>Add the remote to rclone like this: Configure the <code>url</code> as <code>https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/Documents</code> and use your normal account email and password for <code>user</code> and <code>pass</code>. If you have 2FA enabled, you have to generate an app password. Set the <code>vendor</code> to <code>sharepoint</code>.</p>
<p>Your config file should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>[sharepoint]
type = webdav
url = https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/Documents
vendor = sharepoint
user = YourEmailAddress
pass = encryptedpassword</code></pre>
<h3 id="sharepoint-with-ntlm-authentication">Sharepoint with NTLM Authentication</h3>
<p>Use this option in case your (hosted) Sharepoint is not tied to OneDrive accounts and uses NTLM authentication.</p>
<p>To get the <code>url</code> configuration, similarly to the above, first navigate to the desired directory in your browser to get the URL, then strip everything after the name of the opened directory.</p>
<p>Example: If the URL is: https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/12345/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx</p>
<p>The configuration to use would be: https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/12345/Documents</p>
<p>Set the <code>vendor</code> to <code>sharepoint-ntlm</code>.</p>
<p>NTLM uses domain and user name combination for authentication, set <code>user</code> to <code>DOMAIN\username</code>.</p>
<p>Your config file should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>[sharepoint]
type = webdav
url = https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]/some-path-to/Documents
vendor = sharepoint-ntlm
user = DOMAIN\user
pass = encryptedpassword</code></pre>
<h4 id="required-flags-for-sharepoint">Required Flags for SharePoint</h4>
<p>As SharePoint does some special things with uploaded documents, you won't be able to use the documents size or the documents hash to compare if a file has been changed since the upload / which file is newer.</p>
<p>For Rclone calls copying files (especially Office files such as .docx, .xlsx, etc.) from/to SharePoint (like copy, sync, etc.), you should append these flags to ensure Rclone uses the "Last Modified" datetime property to compare your documents:</p>
<pre><code>--ignore-size --ignore-checksum --update</code></pre>
<h2 id="rclone-1">Rclone</h2>
<p>Use this option if you are hosting remotes over WebDAV provided by rclone. Read <a href="commands/rclone_serve_webdav/">rclone serve webdav</a> for more details.</p>
<p>rclone serve supports modified times using the <code>X-OC-Mtime</code> header.</p>
<h3 id="dcache">dCache</h3>
<p>dCache is a storage system that supports many protocols and authentication/authorisation schemes. For WebDAV clients, it allows users to authenticate with username and password (BASIC), X.509, Kerberos, and various bearer tokens, including <a href="https://www.dcache.org/manuals/workshop-2017-05-29-Umea/000-Final/anupam_macaroons_v02.pdf">Macaroons</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect">OpenID-Connect</a> access tokens.</p>
<p>Configure as normal using the <code>other</code> type. Don't enter a username or password, instead enter your Macaroon as the <code>bearer_token</code>.</p>
<p>The config will end up looking something like this.</p>
<pre><code>[dcache]
type = webdav
url = https://dcache...
vendor = other
user =
pass =
bearer_token = your-macaroon</code></pre>
<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/sara-nl/GridScripts/blob/master/get-macaroon">script</a> that obtains a Macaroon from a dCache WebDAV endpoint, and creates an rclone config file.</p>
<p>Macaroons may also be obtained from the dCacheView web-browser/JavaScript client that comes with dCache.</p>
<h3 id="openid-connect">OpenID-Connect</h3>
<p>dCache also supports authenticating with OpenID-Connect access tokens. OpenID-Connect is a protocol (based on OAuth 2.0) that allows services to identify users who have authenticated with some central service.</p>
<p>Support for OpenID-Connect in rclone is currently achieved using another software package called <a href="https://github.com/indigo-dc/oidc-agent">oidc-agent</a>. This is a command-line tool that facilitates obtaining an access token. Once installed and configured, an access token is obtained by running the <code>oidc-token</code> command. The following example shows a (shortened) access token obtained from the <em>XDC</em> OIDC Provider.</p>
<pre><code>paul@celebrimbor:~$ oidc-token XDC

<p><strong>Note</strong> Before the <code>oidc-token</code> command will work, the refresh token must be loaded into the oidc agent. This is done with the <code>oidc-add</code> command (e.g., <code>oidc-add XDC</code>). This is typically done once per login session. Full details on this and how to register oidc-agent with your OIDC Provider are provided in the <a href="https://indigo-dc.gitbooks.io/oidc-agent/">oidc-agent documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The rclone <code>bearer_token_command</code> configuration option is used to fetch the access token from oidc-agent.</p>
<p>Configure as a normal WebDAV endpoint, using the 'other' vendor, leaving the username and password empty. When prompted, choose to edit the advanced config and enter the command to get a bearer token (e.g., <code>oidc-agent XDC</code>).</p>
<p>The following example config shows a WebDAV endpoint that uses oidc-agent to supply an access token from the <em>XDC</em> OIDC Provider.</p>

url = https://dcache.example.org/

<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/remote_setup/">remote setup docs</a> for how to set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.</p>
<p>Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the token as returned from Yandex Disk. This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is on <code>http://127.0.0.1:53682/</code> and this it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.</p>
<p>Once configured you can then use <code>rclone</code> like this,</p>

<h3 id="emptying-trash-2">Emptying Trash</h3>
<p>If you wish to empty your trash you can use the <code>rclone cleanup remote:</code> command which will permanently delete all your trashed files. This command does not take any path arguments.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-42">Limitations</h2>
<p>When uploading very large files (bigger than about 5 GiB) you will need to increase the <code>--timeout</code> parameter. This is because Yandex pauses (perhaps to calculate the MD5SUM for the entire file) before returning confirmation that the file has been uploaded. The default handling of timeouts in rclone is to assume a 5 minute pause is an error and close the connection - you'll see <code>net/http: timeout awaiting response headers</code> errors in the logs if this is happening. Setting the timeout to twice the max size of file in GiB should be enough, so if you want to upload a 30 GiB file set a timeout of <code>2 * 30 = 60m</code>, that is <code>--timeout 60m</code>.</p>
<p>Having a Yandex Mail account is mandatory to use the Yandex.Disk subscription. Token generation will work without a mail account, but Rclone won't be able to complete any actions.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-your-own-client_id">Setting up your own client_id</h2>
<p>For Zoho we advise you to set up your own client_id. To do so you have to complete the following steps.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Log in to the <a href="https://api-console.zoho.com">Zoho API Console</a></p></li>
<li><p>Create a new client of type "Server-based Application". The name and website don't matter, but you must add the redirect URL <code>http://localhost:53682/</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the client is created, you can go to the settings tab and enable it in other regions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The client id and client secret can now be used with rclone.</p>
<h1 id="local-filesystem">Local Filesystem</h1>
<p>Local paths are specified as normal filesystem paths, e.g. <code>/path/to/wherever</code>, so</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive /home/source /tmp/destination</code></pre>
<p>Will sync <code>/home/source</code> to <code>/tmp/destination</code>.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-59">Configuration</h2>
<p>For consistencies sake one can also configure a remote of type <code>local</code> in the config file, and access the local filesystem using rclone remote paths, e.g. <code>remote:path/to/wherever</code>, but it is probably easier not to.</p>
<h3 id="modification-times-9">Modification times</h3>
<p>Rclone reads and writes the modification times using an accuracy determined by the OS. Typically this is 1ns on Linux, 10 ns on Windows and 1 Second on OS X.</p>
<h3 id="filenames">Filenames</h3>
<p>Filenames should be encoded in UTF-8 on disk. This is the normal case for Windows and OS X.</p>
<p>There is a bit more uncertainty in the Linux world, but new distributions will have UTF-8 encoded files names. If you are using an old Linux filesystem with non UTF-8 file names (e.g. latin1) then you can use the <code>convmv</code> tool to convert the filesystem to UTF-8. This tool is available in most distributions' package managers.</p>
<p>If an invalid (non-UTF8) filename is read, the invalid characters will be replaced with a quoted representation of the invalid bytes. The name <code>gro\xdf</code> will be transferred as <code>gro‛DF</code>. <code>rclone</code> will emit a debug message in this case (use <code>-v</code> to see), e.g.</p>
<pre><code>Local file system at .: Replacing invalid UTF-8 characters in &quot;gro\xdf&quot;</code></pre>
<h4 id="restricted-characters-1">Restricted characters</h4>
<p>With the local backend, restrictions on the characters that are usable in file or directory names depend on the operating system. To check what rclone will replace by default on your system, run <code>rclone help flags local-encoding</code>.</p>
<p>On non Windows platforms the following characters are replaced when handling file names.</p>

<h3 id="paths-on-windows">Paths on Windows</h3>
<p>On Windows there are many ways of specifying a path to a file system resource. Local paths can be absolute, like <code>C:\path\to\wherever</code>, or relative, like <code>..\wherever</code>. Network paths in UNC format, <code>\\server\share</code>, are also supported. Path separator can be either <code>\</code> (as in <code>C:\path\to\wherever</code>) or <code>/</code> (as in <code>C:/path/to/wherever</code>). Length of these paths are limited to 259 characters for files and 247 characters for directories, but there is an alternative extended-length path format increasing the limit to (approximately) 32,767 characters. This format requires absolute paths and the use of prefix <code>\\?\</code>, e.g. <code>\\?\D:\some\very\long\path</code>. For convenience rclone will automatically convert regular paths into the corresponding extended-length paths, so in most cases you do not have to worry about this (read more <a href="#long-paths">below</a>). Using the same prefix <code>\\?\</code> it is also possible to specify path to volumes identified by their GUID, e.g. <code>\\?\Volume{b75e2c83-0000-0000-0000-602f00000000}\some\path</code>.</p>
<h4 id="long-paths">Long paths</h4>
<p>Rclone handles long paths automatically, by converting all paths to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation">extended-length path format</a>, which allows paths up to 32,767 characters.</p>
<p>This conversion will ensure paths are absolute and prefix them with the <code>\\?\</code>. This is why you will see that your paths, for instance <code>.\files</code> is shown as path <code>\\?\C:\files</code> in the output, and <code>\\server\share</code> as <code>\\?\UNC\server\share</code>.</p>
<p>However, in rare cases this may cause problems with buggy file system drivers like <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/261">EncFS</a>. To disable UNC conversion globally, add this to your <code>.rclone.conf</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>[local]
nounc = true</code></pre>
<p>If you want to selectively disable UNC, you can add it to a separate entry like this:</p>
<pre><code>[nounc]
type = local
nounc = true</code></pre>
<p>And use rclone like this:</p>
<p><code>rclone copy c:\src nounc:z:\dst</code></p>
<p>This will use UNC paths on <code>c:\src</code> but not on <code>z:\dst</code>. Of course this will cause problems if the absolute path length of a file exceeds 259 characters on z, so only use this option if you have to.</p>
<h3 id="symlinks-junction-points">Symlinks / Junction points</h3>
<p>Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave like symlinks under Windows).</p>
<p>If you supply <code>--copy-links</code> or <code>-L</code> then rclone will follow the symlink and copy the pointed to file or directory. Note that this flag is incompatible with <code>--links</code> / <code>-l</code>.</p>
<p>This flag applies to all commands.</p>
<p>For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this</p>
<pre><code>$ tree /tmp/a
/tmp/a
├── b -&gt; ../b
├── expected -&gt; ../expected
├── one
└── two
    └── three</code></pre>
<p>Then you can see the difference with and without the flag like this</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone ls /tmp/a
        6 one
        6 two/three</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone -L ls /tmp/a
     4174 expected
        6 one
        6 two/three
        6 b/two
        6 b/one</code></pre>
<h4 id="local-links---links--l">--local-links, --links, -l</h4>
<p>Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave like symlinks under Windows).</p>
<p>If you supply this flag then rclone will copy symbolic links from the local storage, and store them as text files, with a <code>.rclonelink</code> suffix in the remote storage.</p>
<p>The text file will contain the target of the symbolic link (see example).</p>
<p>This flag applies to all commands.</p>
<p>For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this</p>
<pre><code>$ tree /tmp/a
/tmp/a
├── file1 -&gt; ./file4
└── file2 -&gt; /home/user/file3</code></pre>
<p>Copying the entire directory with '-l'</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone copy -l /tmp/a/ remote:/tmp/a/</code></pre>
<p>The remote files are created with a <code>.rclonelink</code> suffix</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone ls remote:/tmp/a
       5 file1.rclonelink
      14 file2.rclonelink</code></pre>
<p>The remote files will contain the target of the symbolic links</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone cat remote:/tmp/a/file1.rclonelink
./file4

$ rclone cat remote:/tmp/a/file2.rclonelink
/home/user/file3</code></pre>
<p>Copying them back with '-l'</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone copy -l remote:/tmp/a/ /tmp/b/

$ tree /tmp/b
/tmp/b
├── file1 -&gt; ./file4
└── file2 -&gt; /home/user/file3</code></pre>
<p>However, if copied back without '-l'</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone copyto remote:/tmp/a/ /tmp/b/

$ tree /tmp/b
/tmp/b
├── file1.rclonelink
└── file2.rclonelink</code></pre>
<p>If you want to copy a single file with <code>-l</code> then you must use the <code>.rclonelink</code> suffix.</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone copy -l remote:/tmp/a/file1.rclonelink /tmp/c

$ tree /tmp/c
/tmp/c
└── file1 -&gt; ./file4</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>--local-links</code> just enables this feature for the local backend. <code>--links</code> and <code>-l</code> enable the feature for all supported backends and the VFS.</p>
<p>Note that this flag is incompatible with <code>-copy-links</code> / <code>-L</code>.</p>
<h3 id="restricting-filesystems-with---one-file-system">Restricting filesystems with --one-file-system</h3>
<p>Normally rclone will recurse through filesystems as mounted.</p>
<p>However if you set <code>--one-file-system</code> or <code>-x</code> this tells rclone to stay in the filesystem specified by the root and not to recurse into different file systems.</p>
<p>For example if you have a directory hierarchy like this</p>
<pre><code>root
├── disk1     - disk1 mounted on the root
│   └── file3 - stored on disk1
├── disk2     - disk2 mounted on the root
│   └── file4 - stored on disk12
├── file1     - stored on the root disk
└── file2     - stored on the root disk</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>rclone --one-file-system copy root remote:</code> will only copy <code>file1</code> and <code>file2</code>. Eg</p>
<pre><code>$ rclone -q --one-file-system ls root
        0 file1
        0 file2</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ rclone -q ls root
        0 disk1/file3
        0 disk2/file4
        0 file1
        0 file2</code></pre>
<p><strong>NB</strong> Rclone (like most unix tools such as <code>du</code>, <code>rsync</code> and <code>tar</code>) treats a bind mount to the same device as being on the same filesystem.</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong> This flag is only available on Unix based systems. On systems where it isn't supported (e.g. Windows) it will be ignored.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-options-63">Advanced options</h3>
<p>Here are the Advanced options specific to local (Local Disk).</p>
<h4 id="local-nounc">--local-nounc</h4>
<p>Disable UNC (long path names) conversion on Windows.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: nounc</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_NOUNC</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>"true"
<ul>
<li>Disables long file names.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="copy-links--l">--copy-links / -L</h4>
<p>Follow symlinks and copy the pointed to item.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: copy_links</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_COPY_LINKS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="local-links">--local-links</h4>
<p>Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a '.rclonelink' extension for the local backend.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: links</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_LINKS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="skip-links">--skip-links</h4>
<p>Don't warn about skipped symlinks.</p>
<p>This flag disables warning messages on skipped symlinks or junction points, as you explicitly acknowledge that they should be skipped.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: skip_links</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="local-zero-size-links">--local-zero-size-links</h4>
<p>Assume the Stat size of links is zero (and read them instead) (deprecated).</p>
<p>Rclone used to use the Stat size of links as the link size, but this fails in quite a few places:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>On some virtual filesystems (such ash LucidLink)</li>
<li>Android</li>
</ul>
<p>So rclone now always reads the link.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: zero_size_links</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_ZERO_SIZE_LINKS</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="local-unicode-normalization">--local-unicode-normalization</h4>
<p>Apply unicode NFC normalization to paths and filenames.</p>
<p>This flag can be used to normalize file names into unicode NFC form that are read from the local filesystem.</p>
<p>Rclone does not normally touch the encoding of file names it reads from the file system.</p>
<p>This can be useful when using macOS as it normally provides decomposed (NFD) unicode which in some language (eg Korean) doesn't display properly on some OSes.</p>
<p>Note that rclone compares filenames with unicode normalization in the sync routine so this flag shouldn't normally be used.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: unicode_normalization</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_UNICODE_NORMALIZATION</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="local-no-check-updated">--local-no-check-updated</h4>
<p>Don't check to see if the files change during upload.</p>
<p>Normally rclone checks the size and modification time of files as they are being uploaded and aborts with a message which starts "can't copy - source file is being updated" if the file changes during upload.</p>
<p>However on some file systems this modification time check may fail (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2206">Glusterfs #2206</a>) so this check can be disabled with this flag.</p>
<p>If this flag is set, rclone will use its best efforts to transfer a file which is being updated. If the file is only having things appended to it (e.g. a log) then rclone will transfer the log file with the size it had the first time rclone saw it.</p>
<p>If the file is being modified throughout (not just appended to) then the transfer may fail with a hash check failure.</p>
<p>In detail, once the file has had stat() called on it for the first time we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only transfer the size that stat gave</li>
<li>Only checksum the size that stat gave</li>
<li>Don't update the stat info for the file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NB</strong> do not use this flag on a Windows Volume Shadow (VSS). For some unknown reason, files in a VSS sometimes show different sizes from the directory listing (where the initial stat value comes from on Windows) and when stat is called on them directly. Other copy tools always use the direct stat value and setting this flag will disable that.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: no_check_updated</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_CHECK_UPDATED</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="one-file-system--x">--one-file-system / -x</h4>
<p>Don't cross filesystem boundaries (unix/macOS only).</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: one_file_system</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_ONE_FILE_SYSTEM</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="local-case-sensitive">--local-case-sensitive</h4>
<p>Force the filesystem to report itself as case sensitive.</p>
<p>Normally the local backend declares itself as case insensitive on Windows/macOS and case sensitive for everything else. Use this flag to override the default choice.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: case_sensitive</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_CASE_SENSITIVE</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="local-case-insensitive">--local-case-insensitive</h4>
<p>Force the filesystem to report itself as case insensitive.</p>
<p>Normally the local backend declares itself as case insensitive on Windows/macOS and case sensitive for everything else. Use this flag to override the default choice.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: case_insensitive</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_CASE_INSENSITIVE</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="local-no-clone">--local-no-clone</h4>
<p>Disable reflink cloning for server-side copies.</p>
<p>Normally, for local-to-local transfers, rclone will "clone" the file when possible, and fall back to "copying" only when cloning is not supported.</p>
<p>Cloning creates a shallow copy (or "reflink") which initially shares blocks with the original file. Unlike a "hardlink", the two files are independent and neither will affect the other if subsequently modified.</p>
<p>Cloning is usually preferable to copying, as it is much faster and is deduplicated by default (i.e. having two identical files does not consume more storage than having just one.) However, for use cases where data redundancy is preferable, --local-no-clone can be used to disable cloning and force "deep" copies.</p>
<p>Currently, cloning is only supported when using APFS on macOS (support for other platforms may be added in the future.)</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: no_clone</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_CLONE</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="local-no-preallocate">--local-no-preallocate</h4>
<p>Disable preallocation of disk space for transferred files.</p>
<p>Preallocation of disk space helps prevent filesystem fragmentation. However, some virtual filesystem layers (such as Google Drive File Stream) may incorrectly set the actual file size equal to the preallocated space, causing checksum and file size checks to fail. Use this flag to disable preallocation.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: no_preallocate</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_PREALLOCATE</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="local-no-sparse">--local-no-sparse</h4>
<p>Disable sparse files for multi-thread downloads.</p>
<p>On Windows platforms rclone will make sparse files when doing multi-thread downloads. This avoids long pauses on large files where the OS zeros the file. However sparse files may be undesirable as they cause disk fragmentation and can be slow to work with.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: no_sparse</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_SPARSE</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="local-no-set-modtime">--local-no-set-modtime</h4>
<p>Disable setting modtime.</p>
<p>Normally rclone updates modification time of files after they are done uploading. This can cause permissions issues on Linux platforms when the user rclone is running as does not own the file uploaded, such as when copying to a CIFS mount owned by another user. If this option is enabled, rclone will no longer update the modtime after copying a file.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: no_set_modtime</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_SET_MODTIME</li>
<li>Type: bool</li>
<li>Default: false</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="local-time-type">--local-time-type</h4>
<p>Set what kind of time is returned.</p>
<p>Normally rclone does all operations on the mtime or Modification time.</p>
<p>If you set this flag then rclone will return the Modified time as whatever you set here. So if you use "rclone lsl --local-time-type ctime" then you will see ctimes in the listing.</p>
<p>If the OS doesn't support returning the time_type specified then rclone will silently replace it with the modification time which all OSes support.</p>
<ul>
<li>mtime is supported by all OSes</li>
<li>atime is supported on all OSes except: plan9, js</li>
<li>btime is only supported on: Windows, macOS, freebsd, netbsd</li>
<li>ctime is supported on all Oses except: Windows, plan9, js</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that setting the time will still set the modified time so this is only useful for reading.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: time_type</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_TIME_TYPE</li>
<li>Type: mtime|atime|btime|ctime</li>
<li>Default: mtime</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>"mtime"
<ul>
<li>The last modification time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"atime"
<ul>
<li>The last access time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"btime"
<ul>
<li>The creation time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"ctime"
<ul>
<li>The last status change time.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="local-encoding">--local-encoding</h4>
<p>The encoding for the backend.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding">encoding section in the overview</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: encoding</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_ENCODING</li>
<li>Type: Encoding</li>
<li>Default: Slash,Dot</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="local-description">--local-description</h4>
<p>Description of the remote.</p>
<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config: description</li>
<li>Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_DESCRIPTION</li>
<li>Type: string</li>
<li>Required: false</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="metadata-17">Metadata</h3>
<p>Depending on which OS is in use the local backend may return only some of the system metadata. Setting system metadata is supported on all OSes but setting user metadata is only supported on linux, freebsd, netbsd, macOS and Solaris. It is <strong>not</strong> supported on Windows yet (<a href="https://github.com/pkg/xattr/issues/47">see pkg/attrs#47</a>).</p>
<p>User metadata is stored as extended attributes (which may not be supported by all file systems) under the "user.*" prefix.</p>
<p>Metadata is supported on files and directories.</p>

<li>Copies and deletes are now handled in one operation instead of two (nielash)</li>
<li><code>--track-renames</code> and <code>--backup-dir</code> are now supported (nielash)</li>
<li>Final listings are now generated from sync results, to avoid needing to re-list (nielash)</li>
<li>Bisync is now much more resilient to changes that happen during a bisync run, and far less prone to critical errors / undetected changes (nielash)</li>

<li>Bisync now fully supports comparing based on any combination of size, modtime, and checksum, lifting the prior restriction on backends without modtime support. (nielash)</li>
<li>Bisync now supports a "Graceful Shutdown" mode to cleanly cancel a run early without requiring <code>--resync</code>. (nielash)</li>
<li>New <code>--recover</code> flag allows robust recovery in the event of interruptions, without requiring <code>--resync</code>. (nielash)</li>
<li>A new <code>--max-lock</code> setting allows lock files to automatically renew and expire, for better automatic recovery when a run is interrupted. (nielash)</li>
<li>Bisync now supports auto-resolving sync conflicts and customizing rename behavior with new <a href="#conflict-resolve"><code>--conflict-resolve</code></a>, <a href="#conflict-loser"><code>--conflict-loser</code></a>, and <a href="#conflict-suffix"><code>--conflict-suffix</code></a> flags. (nielash)</li>
<li>A new <a href="#resync-mode"><code>--resync-mode</code></a> flag allows more control over which version of a file gets kept during a <code>--resync</code>. (nielash)</li>
<li>Bisync now supports <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#retries-int"><code>--retries</code></a> and <a href="/docs/#retries-sleep-time"><code>--retries-sleep</code></a> (when <a href="#resilient"><code>--resilient</code></a> is set.) (nielash)</li>

<h1 id="bugs-and-limitations">Bugs and Limitations</h1>
<h2 id="limitations-43">Limitations</h2>
<h3 id="directory-timestamps-arent-preserved-on-some-backends">Directory timestamps aren't preserved on some backends</h3>
<p>As of <code>v1.66</code>, rclone supports syncing directory modtimes, if the backend supports it. Some backends do not support it -- see <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/">overview</a> for a complete list. Additionally, note that empty directories are not synced by default (this can be enabled with <code>--create-empty-src-dirs</code>.)</p>
<h3 id="rclone-struggles-with-millions-of-files-in-a-directorybucket">Rclone struggles with millions of files in a directory/bucket</h3>
<p>Currently rclone loads each directory/bucket entirely into memory before using it. Since each rclone object takes 0.5k-1k of memory this can take a very long time and use a large amount of memory.</p>
<p>Millions of files in a directory tends to occur on bucket-based remotes (e.g. S3 buckets) since those remotes do not segregate subdirectories within the bucket.</p>
<h3 id="bucket-based-remotes-and-folders">Bucket-based remotes and folders</h3>
<p>Bucket-based remotes (e.g. S3/GCS/Swift/B2) do not have a concept of directories. Rclone therefore cannot create directories in them which means that empty directories on a bucket-based remote will tend to disappear.</p>
<p>Some software creates empty keys ending in <code>/</code> as directory markers. Rclone doesn't do this as it potentially creates more objects and costs more. This ability may be added in the future (probably via a flag/option).</p>

<h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h3 id="do-all-cloud-storage-systems-support-all-rclone-commands">Do all cloud storage systems support all rclone commands</h3>
<p>Yes they do. All the rclone commands (e.g. <code>sync</code>, <code>copy</code>, etc.) will work on all the remote storage systems.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-copy-the-config-from-one-machine-to-another">Can I copy the config from one machine to another</h3>
<p>Sure! Rclone stores all of its config in a single file. If you want to find this file, run <code>rclone config file</code> which will tell you where it is.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rclone.org/remote_setup/">remote setup docs</a> for more info.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-configure-rclone-on-a-remote-headless-box-with-no-browser">How do I configure rclone on a remote / headless box with no browser?</h3>
<p>This has now been documented in its own <a href="https://rclone.org/remote_setup/">remote setup page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-get-rid-of-the-config-file-not-found-notice">How can I get rid of the "Config file not found" notice?</h3>
<p>If you see a notice like 'NOTICE: Config file "rclone.conf" not found', this means you have not configured any remotes.</p>
<p>If you need to configure a remote, see the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#configure">config help docs</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using rclone entirely with <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#backend-path-to-dir">on the fly remotes</a>, you can create an empty config file to get rid of this notice, for example:</p>
<pre><code>rclone config touch</code></pre>
<h3 id="can-rclone-sync-directly-from-drive-to-s3">Can rclone sync directly from drive to s3</h3>
<p>Rclone can sync between two remote cloud storage systems just fine.</p>
<p>Note that it effectively downloads the file and uploads it again, so the node running rclone would need to have lots of bandwidth.</p>
<p>The syncs would be incremental (on a file by file basis).</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre><code>rclone sync --interactive drive:Folder s3:bucket</code></pre>
<h3 id="using-rclone-from-multiple-locations-at-the-same-time">Using rclone from multiple locations at the same time</h3>
<p>You can use rclone from multiple places at the same time if you choose different subdirectory for the output, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>Server A&gt; rclone sync --interactive /tmp/whatever remote:ServerA
Server B&gt; rclone sync --interactive /tmp/whatever remote:ServerB</code></pre>
<p>If you sync to the same directory then you should use rclone copy otherwise the two instances of rclone may delete each other's files, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>Server A&gt; rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup
Server B&gt; rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup</code></pre>
<p>The file names you upload from Server A and Server B should be different in this case, otherwise some file systems (e.g. Drive) may make duplicates.</p>
<h3 id="why-doesnt-rclone-support-partial-transfers-binary-diffs-like-rsync">Why doesn't rclone support partial transfers / binary diffs like rsync?</h3>
<p>Rclone stores each file you transfer as a native object on the remote cloud storage system. This means that you can see the files you upload as expected using alternative access methods (e.g. using the Google Drive web interface). There is a 1:1 mapping between files on your hard disk and objects created in the cloud storage system.</p>
<p>Cloud storage systems (at least none I've come across yet) don't support partially uploading an object. You can't take an existing object, and change some bytes in the middle of it.</p>
<p>It would be possible to make a sync system which stored binary diffs like rsync does, instead of whole objects, but that would break the 1:1 mapping of files on your hard disk to objects in the remote cloud storage system.</p>
<p>All the cloud storage systems support partial downloads of content, so it would be possible to make partial downloads work. However to make this work efficiently this would require storing a significant amount of metadata, which breaks the desired 1:1 mapping of files to objects.</p>
<h3 id="can-rclone-do-bi-directional-sync">Can rclone do bi-directional sync?</h3>
<p>Yes, since rclone v1.58.0, <a href="https://rclone.org/bisync/">bidirectional cloud sync</a> is available.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-use-rclone-with-an-http-proxy">Can I use rclone with an HTTP proxy?</h3>
<p>Yes. rclone will follow the standard environment variables for proxies, similar to cURL and other programs.</p>
<p>In general the variables are called <code>http_proxy</code> (for services reached over <code>http</code>) and <code>https_proxy</code> (for services reached over <code>https</code>). Most public services will be using <code>https</code>, but you may wish to set both.</p>
<p>The content of the variable is <code>protocol://server:port</code>. The protocol value is the one used to talk to the proxy server, itself, and is commonly either <code>http</code> or <code>socks5</code>.</p>
<p>Slightly annoyingly, there is no <em>standard</em> for the name; some applications may use <code>http_proxy</code> but another one <code>HTTP_PROXY</code>. The <code>Go</code> libraries used by <code>rclone</code> will try both variations, but you may wish to set all possibilities. So, on Linux, you may end up with code similar to</p>
<pre><code>export http_proxy=http://proxyserver:12345
export https_proxy=$http_proxy
export HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY=$http_proxy</code></pre>
<p>Note: If the proxy server requires a username and password, then use</p>
<pre><code>export http_proxy=http://username:password@proxyserver:12345
export https_proxy=$http_proxy
export HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY=$http_proxy</code></pre>
<p>The <code>NO_PROXY</code> allows you to disable the proxy for specific hosts. Hosts must be comma separated, and can contain domains or parts. For instance "foo.com" also matches "bar.foo.com".</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre><code>export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.0/8,my.host.name
export NO_PROXY=$no_proxy</code></pre>
<p>Note that the FTP backend does not support <code>ftp_proxy</code> yet.</p>
<h3 id="rclone-gives-x509-failed-to-load-system-roots-and-no-roots-provided-error">Rclone gives x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided error</h3>
<p>This means that <code>rclone</code> can't find the SSL root certificates. Likely you are running <code>rclone</code> on a NAS with a cut-down Linux OS, or possibly on Solaris.</p>
<p>Rclone (via the Go runtime) tries to load the root certificates from these places on Linux.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt&quot;, // Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo etc.
&quot;/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt&quot;,   // Fedora/RHEL
&quot;/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem&quot;,             // OpenSUSE
&quot;/etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem&quot;,            // OpenELEC</code></pre>
<p>So doing something like this should fix the problem. It also sets the time which is important for SSL to work properly.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p /etc/ssl/certs/
curl -o /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt
ntpclient -s -h pool.ntp.org</code></pre>
<p>The two environment variables <code>SSL_CERT_FILE</code> and <code>SSL_CERT_DIR</code>, mentioned in the <a href="https://godoc.org/crypto/x509">x509 package</a>, provide an additional way to provide the SSL root certificates.</p>
<p>Note that you may need to add the <code>--insecure</code> option to the <code>curl</code> command line if it doesn't work without.</p>
<pre><code>curl --insecure -o /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt</code></pre>
<h3 id="rclone-gives-failed-to-load-config-file-function-not-implemented-error">Rclone gives Failed to load config file: function not implemented error</h3>
<p>Likely this means that you are running rclone on Linux version not supported by the go runtime, ie earlier than version 2.6.23.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">system requirements section in the go install docs</a> for full details.</p>
<h3 id="all-my-uploaded-docxxlsxpptx-files-appear-as-archivezip">All my uploaded docx/xlsx/pptx files appear as archive/zip</h3>
<p>This is caused by uploading these files from a Windows computer which hasn't got the Microsoft Office suite installed. The easiest way to fix is to install the Word viewer and the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 and later versions' file formats</p>
<h3 id="tcp-lookup-some.domain.com-no-such-host">tcp lookup some.domain.com no such host</h3>
<p>This happens when rclone cannot resolve a domain. Please check that your DNS setup is generally working, e.g.</p>
<pre><code># both should print a long list of possible IP addresses
dig www.googleapis.com          # resolve using your default DNS
dig www.googleapis.com @8.8.8.8 # resolve with Google&#39;s DNS server</code></pre>
<p>If you are using <code>systemd-resolved</code> (default on Arch Linux), ensure it is at version 233 or higher. Previous releases contain a bug which causes not all domains to be resolved properly.</p>
<p>The Go resolver decision can be influenced with the <code>GODEBUG=netdns=...</code> environment variable. This also allows to resolve certain issues with DNS resolution. On Windows or MacOS systems, try forcing use of the internal Go resolver by setting <code>GODEBUG=netdns=go</code> at runtime. On other systems (Linux, *BSD, etc) try forcing use of the system name resolver by setting <code>GODEBUG=netdns=cgo</code> (and recompile rclone from source with CGO enabled if necessary). See the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/#hdr-Name_Resolution">name resolution section in the go docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="failed-to-start-auth-webserver-on-windows">Failed to start auth webserver on Windows</h3>
<pre><code>Error: config failed to refresh token: failed to start auth webserver: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:53682: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions.
...
yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss Fatal error: config failed to refresh token: failed to start auth webserver: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:53682: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions.</code></pre>
<p>This is sometimes caused by the Host Network Service causing issues with opening the port on the host.</p>
<p>A simple solution may be restarting the Host Network Service with eg. Powershell</p>
<pre><code>Restart-Service hns</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-total-size-reported-in-the-stats-for-a-sync-is-wrong-and-keeps-changing">The total size reported in the stats for a sync is wrong and keeps changing</h3>
<p>It is likely you have more than 10,000 files that need to be synced. By default, rclone only gets 10,000 files ahead in a sync so as not to use up too much memory. You can change this default with the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#max-backlog-n">--max-backlog</a> flag.</p>
<h3 id="rclone-is-using-too-much-memory-or-appears-to-have-a-memory-leak">Rclone is using too much memory or appears to have a memory leak</h3>
<p>Rclone is written in Go which uses a garbage collector. The default settings for the garbage collector mean that it runs when the heap size has doubled.</p>
<p>However it is possible to tune the garbage collector to use less memory by <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/tag/gogc">setting GOGC</a> to a lower value, say <code>export GOGC=20</code>. This will make the garbage collector work harder, reducing memory size at the expense of CPU usage.</p>
<p>The most common cause of rclone using lots of memory is a single directory with millions of files in.</p>
<p>Before rclone v1.70 has to load this entirely into memory as rclone objects. Each rclone object takes 0.5k-1k of memory. There is <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone/wiki/Big-syncs-with-millions-of-files">a workaround for this</a> which involves a bit of scripting.</p>
<p>However with rclone v1.70 and later rclone will automatically save directory entries to disk when a directory with more than <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#list-cutoff"><code>--list-cutoff</code></a> (1,000,000 by default) entries is detected.</p>
<p>From v1.70 rclone also has the <a href="https://rclone.org/docs/#max-buffer-memory">--max-buffer-memory</a> flag which helps particularly when multi-thread transfers are using too much memory.</p>
<h3 id="rclone-changes-fullwidth-unicode-punctuation-marks-in-file-names">Rclone changes fullwidth Unicode punctuation marks in file names</h3>
<p>For example: On a Windows system, you have a file with name <code>Test：1.jpg</code>, where <code>：</code> is the Unicode fullwidth colon symbol. When using rclone to copy this to your Google Drive, you will notice that the file gets renamed to <code>Test:1.jpg</code>, where <code>:</code> is the regular (halfwidth) colon.</p>
<p>The reason for such renames is the way rclone handles different <a href="https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-filenames">restricted filenames</a> on different cloud storage systems. It tries to avoid ambiguous file names as much and allow moving files between many cloud storage systems transparently, by replacing invalid characters with similar looking Unicode characters when transferring to one storage system, and replacing back again when transferring to a different storage system where the original characters are supported. When the same Unicode characters are intentionally used in file names, this replacement strategy leads to unwanted renames.
