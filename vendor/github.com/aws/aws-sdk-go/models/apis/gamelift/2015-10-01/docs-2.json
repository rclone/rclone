  "service": "<fullname>Amazon GameLift Service</fullname> <p> Amazon GameLift is a managed service for developers who need a scalable, dedicated server solution for their multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift provides tools for the following tasks: (1) acquire computing resources and deploy game servers, (2) scale game server capacity to meet player demand, (3) host game sessions and manage player access, and (4) track in-depth metrics on player usage and server performance.</p> <p>The Amazon GameLift service API includes two important function sets:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Manage game sessions and player access</b> – Retrieve information on available game sessions; create new game sessions; send player requests to join a game session.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Configure and manage game server resources</b> – Manage builds, fleets, queues, and aliases; set autoscaling policies; retrieve logs and metrics.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This reference guide describes the low-level service API for Amazon GameLift. You can use the API functionality with these tools: </p> <ul> <li> <p>The Amazon Web Services software development kit (<a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk\">AWS SDK</a>) is available in <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-supported.html#gamelift-supported-clients\">multiple languages</a> including C++ and C#. Use the SDK to access the API programmatically from an application, such as a game client.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS command-line interface</a> (CLI) tool is primarily useful for handling administrative actions, such as setting up and managing Amazon GameLift settings and resources. You can use the AWS CLI to manage all of your AWS services.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/home\">AWS Management Console</a> for Amazon GameLift provides a web interface to manage your Amazon GameLift settings and resources. The console includes a dashboard for tracking key resources, includings builds and fleets, and displays usage and performance metrics for your games as customizable graphs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon GameLift Local is a tool for testing your game's integration with Amazon GameLift before deploying it on the service. This tools supports a subset of key API actions, which can be called from either the AWS CLI or programmatically.

  "operations": {
    "CreateAlias": "<p>Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. By using a fleet alias instead of a specific fleet ID, you can switch gameplay and players to a new fleet without changing your game client or other game components. For example, for games in production, using an alias allows you to seamlessly redirect your player base to a new game server update. </p> <p>Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site. </p> <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID, which you can reference when creating a game session. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling <code>UpdateAlias</code>.</p> <p>Alias-related operations include:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListAliases</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ResolveAlias</a> </p> </li> </ul>",
    "CreateBuild": "<p>Creates a new Amazon GameLift build from a set of game server binary files stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) location. To use this API call, create a <code>.zip</code> file containing all of the files for the build and store it in an Amazon S3 bucket under your AWS account. For help on packaging your build files and creating a build, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-build-intro.html\">Uploading Your Game to Amazon GameLift</a>.</p> <important> <p>Use this API action ONLY if you are storing your game build files in an Amazon S3 bucket. To create a build using files stored locally, use the CLI command <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html\"> <code>upload-build</code> </a>, which uploads the build files from a file location you specify.</p> </important> <p>To create a new build using <code>CreateBuild</code>, identify the storage location and operating system of your game build. You also have the option of specifying a build name and version. If successful, this action creates a new build record with an unique build ID and in <code>INITIALIZED</code> status. Use the API call <a>DescribeBuild</a> to check the status of your build. A build must be in <code>READY</code> status before it can be used to create fleets to host your game.</p> <p>Build-related operations include:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateBuild</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListBuilds</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeBuild</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateBuild</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteBuild</a> </p> </li> </ul>",
    "CreateFleet": "<p>Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. A fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of which can run multiple server processes to host game sessions. You configure a fleet to create instances with certain hardware specifications (see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\">Amazon EC2 Instance Types</a> for more information), and deploy a specified game build to each instance. A newly created fleet passes through several statuses; once it reaches the <code>ACTIVE</code> status, it can begin hosting game sessions.</p> <p>To create a new fleet, you must specify the following: (1) fleet name, (2) build ID of an uploaded game build, (3) an EC2 instance type, and (4) a run-time configuration that describes which server processes to run on each instance in the fleet. (Although the run-time configuration is not a required parameter, the fleet cannot be successfully activated without it.)</p> <p>You can also configure the new fleet with the following settings:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Fleet description</p> </li> <li> <p>Access permissions for inbound traffic</p> </li> <li> <p>Fleetwide game session protection</p> </li> <li> <p>Resource creation limit</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you use Amazon CloudWatch for metrics, you can add the new fleet to a metric group. This allows you to view aggregated metrics for a set of fleets. Once you specify a metric group, the new fleet's metrics are included in the metric group's data.</p> <p>If the CreateFleet call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the following tasks:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Creates a fleet record and sets the status to <code>NEW</code> (followed by other statuses as the fleet is activated).</p> </li> <li> <p>Sets the fleet's target capacity to 1 (desired instances), which causes Amazon GameLift to start one new EC2 instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Starts launching server processes on the instance. If the fleet is configured to run multiple server processes per instance, Amazon GameLift staggers each launch by a few seconds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be accessed in the Amazon GameLift console.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sets the fleet's status to <code>ACTIVE</code> as soon as one server process in the fleet is ready to host a game session.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Fleet-related operations include:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateFleet</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListFleets</a> </p> </li> <li> <p>Describe fleets:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DescribeFleetAttributes</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeFleetPortSettings</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeFleetUtilization</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeRuntimeConfiguration</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeFleetEvents</a> </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Update fleets:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>UpdateFleetAttributes</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateFleetPortSettings</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateRuntimeConfiguration</a> </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Manage fleet capacity:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DescribeFleetCapacity</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutScalingPolicy</a> (automatic scaling)</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeScalingPolicies</a> (automatic scaling)</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a> (automatic scaling)</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeEC2InstanceLimits</a> </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteFleet</a> </p> </li> </ul>",
    "CreateGameSession": "<p>Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This action creates a game session record and assigns an available server process in the specified fleet to host the game session. A fleet must have an <code>ACTIVE</code> status before a game session can be created in it.</p> <p>To create a game session, specify either fleet ID or alias ID and indicate a maximum number of players to allow in the game session. You can also provide a name and game-specific properties for this game session. If successful, a <a>GameSession</a> object is returned containing game session properties, including a game session ID with the custom string you provided.</p> <p> <b>Idempotency tokens.</b> You can add a token that uniquely identifies game session requests. This is useful for ensuring that game session requests are idempotent. Multiple requests with the same idempotency token are processed only once; subsequent requests return the original result. All response values are the same with the exception of game session status, which may change.</p> <p> <b>Resource creation limits.</b> If you are creating a game session on a fleet with a resource creation limit policy in force, then you must specify a creator ID. Without this ID, Amazon GameLift has no way to evaluate the policy for this new game session request.</p> <p> By default, newly created game sessions allow new players to join.

    "CreateGameSessionQueue": "<p>Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game sessions. A queue identifies where new game sessions can be hosted -- by specifying a list of destinations (fleets or aliases) -- and how long requests can wait in the queue before timing out. You can set up a queue to try to place game sessions on fleets in multiple regions. To add placement requests to a queue, call <a>StartGameSessionPlacement</a> and reference the queue name.</p> <p> <b>Destination order.</b> When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host the new game session. A queue's default order is determined by how destinations are listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible gameplay experience.</p> <p> <b>Player latency policies.</b> For placement requests containing player latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher cap for the next 60 seconds, etc. </p> <p>To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and, if desired, a set of latency policies.
