// Package gamelift provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon GameLift.
//
// Amazon GameLift is a managed service for developers who need a scalable,
// dedicated server solution for their multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift provides
// tools for the following tasks: (1) acquire computing resources and deploy
// game servers, (2) scale game server capacity to meet player demand, (3) host
// game sessions and manage player access, and (4) track in-depth metrics on
// player usage and server performance.
//
// The Amazon GameLift service API includes two important function sets:
//
//    * Manage game sessions and player access – Retrieve information on available
//    game sessions; create new game sessions; send player requests to join
//    a game session.
//
//    * Configure and manage game server resources – Manage builds, fleets,
//    queues, and aliases; set autoscaling policies; retrieve logs and metrics.
//
// This reference guide describes the low-level service API for Amazon GameLift.
// You can use the API functionality with these tools:
//
//    * The Amazon Web Services software development kit (AWS SDK (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk))
//    is available in multiple languages (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-supported.html#gamelift-supported-clients)
//    including C++ and C#. Use the SDK to access the API programmatically from
//    an application, such as a game client.
//
//    * The AWS command-line interface (http://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (CLI) tool
//    is primarily useful for handling administrative actions, such as setting
//    up and managing Amazon GameLift settings and resources. You can use the
//    AWS CLI to manage all of your AWS services.
//
//    * The AWS Management Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/home)
//    for Amazon GameLift provides a web interface to manage your Amazon GameLift
//    settings and resources. The console includes a dashboard for tracking
//    key resources, includings builds and fleets, and displays usage and performance
//    metrics for your games as customizable graphs.
//
//    * Amazon GameLift Local is a tool for testing your game's integration
//    with Amazon GameLift before deploying it on the service. This tools supports
//    a subset of key API actions, which can be called from either the AWS CLI
//    or programmatically. See Testing an Integration (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/integration-testing-local.html).

// API SUMMARY
//
// This list offers a functional overview of the Amazon GameLift service API.

// Setting Up and Managing Game Servers
//
// When setting up Amazon GameLift resources for your game, you first create
// a game build (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-build-intro.html)

//
// Using the Client
//
// To use the client for Amazon GameLift you will first need
// to create a new instance of it.
//
// When creating a client for an AWS service you'll first need to have a Session
// already created. The Session provides configuration that can be shared
// between multiple service clients. Additional configuration can be applied to
// the Session and service's client when they are constructed. The aws package's
// Config type contains several fields such as Region for the AWS Region the
// client should make API requests too. The optional Config value can be provided
// as the variadic argument for Sessions and client creation.
//
// Once the service's client is created you can use it to make API requests the
// AWS service. These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
//   // Create a session to share configuration, and load external configuration.
//   sess := session.Must(session.NewSession())
//
//   // Create the service's client with the session.
//   svc := gamelift.New(sess)
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use service clients.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws package's Config type for more information on configuration options.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/#Config
//
// See the Amazon GameLift client GameLift for more
// information on creating the service's client.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/gamelift/#New
//
// Once the client is created you can make an API request to the service.
// Each API method takes a input parameter, and returns the service response
// and an error.
//
// The API method will document which error codes the service can be returned
// by the operation if the service models the API operation's errors. These
// errors will also be available as const strings prefixed with "ErrCode".
//
//   result, err := svc.CreateAlias(params)
//   if err != nil {
//       // Cast err to awserr.Error to handle specific error codes.
//       aerr, ok := err.(awserr.Error)
//       if ok && aerr.Code() == <error code to check for> {
//           // Specific error code handling
//       }
//       return err
//   }
//
//   fmt.Println("CreateAlias result:")
//   fmt.Println(result)
//
// Using the Client with Context
//
// The service's client also provides methods to make API requests with a Context
// value. This allows you to control the timeout, and cancellation of pending
// requests. These methods also take request Option as variadic parameter to apply
// additional configuration to the API request.
//
//   ctx := context.Background()
//
//   result, err := svc.CreateAliasWithContext(ctx, params)
//
// See the request package documentation for more information on using Context pattern
// with the SDK.
