Storj is building a decentralized cloud storage network.
[Check out our white paper for more info!](https://storj.io/white-paper)

----

Storj is an S3-compatible platform and suite of decentralized applications that
allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. Your files are
encrypted, broken into little pieces and stored in a global decentralized
network of computers. Luckily, we also support allowing you (and only you) to
retrieve those files!

### A Note about Versioning

Our versioning in this repo is intended to primarily support the expectations of the
[Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) system, so you can expect that
within a major version release, backwards-incompatible changes will be avoided at high
cost. This is not the case with our downstream repo,
[storj/storj](https://github.com/storj/storj/).
