The error code should be an enum value of\ngoogle.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The\nerror message should be a developer-facing English message that helps\ndevelopers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing\nerror message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or\nlocalize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary\ninformation about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types\nin the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.\n\n# Language mapping\n\nThe `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it\nis not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is\nexposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be\nmapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions\nin Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.\n\n# Other uses\n\nThe error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of\nenvironments, either with or without APIs, to provide a\nconsistent developer experience across different environments.\n\nExample uses of this error model include:\n\n- Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,\n    it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial\n    errors.\n\n- Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may\n    have a `Status` message for error reporting.\n\n- Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the\n    `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for\n    each error sub-response.\n\n- Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation\n    results in its response, the status of those operations should be\n    represented directly using the `Status` message.\n\n- Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could\n    be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.",

This is expected to happen\nonly rarely, but over time this can accumulate. Services can invoke\nStartReconciliation and EndReconciliation to correct this usage drift, as\ndescribed below:\n1. Service sends StartReconciliation with a timestamp in future for each\n   metric that needs to be reconciled. The timestamp being in future allows\n   to account for in-flight AllocateQuota and ReleaseQuota requests for the\n   same metric.\n2. One Platform records this timestamp and starts tracking subsequent\n   AllocateQuota and ReleaseQuota requests until EndReconciliation is\n   called.\n3. At or after the time specified in the StartReconciliation, service\n   sends EndReconciliation with the usage that needs to be reconciled to.\n4. One Platform adjusts its own record of usage for that metric to the\n   value specified in EndReconciliation by taking in to account any\n   allocation or release between StartReconciliation and EndReconciliation.\n\nSignals the quota controller that the service wants to perform a usage\nreconciliation as specified in the request.\n\nThis method requires the `servicemanagement.services.quota`\npermission on the specified service.
