{{< icon "fab fa-amazon" >}} Amazon S3 Storage Providers
--------------------------------------------------------

The S3 backend can be used with a number of different providers:

{{< provider_list >}}
{{< provider name="AWS S3" home="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" config="/s3/#amazon-s3" start="true" >}}
{{< provider name="Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) Object Storage System (OSS)" home="https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/oss/" config="/s3/#alibaba-oss" >}}
{{< provider name="Ceph" home="http://ceph.com/" config="/s3/#ceph" >}}
{{< provider name="DigitalOcean Spaces" home="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/object-storage/" config="/s3/#digitalocean-spaces" >}}
{{< provider name="Dreamhost" home="https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/" config="/s3/#dreamhost" >}}
{{< provider name="IBM COS S3" home="http://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage" config="/s3/#ibm-cos-s3" >}}
{{< provider name="Minio" home="https://www.minio.io/" config="/s3/#minio" >}}
{{< provider name="Scaleway" home="https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/" config="/s3/#scaleway" >}}
{{< provider name="StackPath" home="https://www.stackpath.com/products/object-storage/" config="/s3/#stackpath" >}}
{{< provider name="Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS)" home="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/cos" config="/s3/#tencent-cos" >}}
{{< provider name="Wasabi" home="https://wasabi.com/" config="/s3/#wasabi" end="true" >}}
{{< /provider_list >}}

Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

Once you have made a remote (see the provider specific section above)
you can use it like this:

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:bucket

## AWS S3 {#amazon-s3}

### Modified time ###

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
`X-Amz-Meta-Mtime` as floating point since the epoch accurate to 1 ns.

If the modification time needs to be updated rclone will attempt to perform a server
side copy to update the modification if the object can be copied in a single part.
In the case the object is larger than 5Gb or is in Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive
storage the object will be uploaded rather than copied.

Note that reading this from the object takes an additional `HEAD`
request as the metadata isn't returned in object listings.

### Reducing costs

#### Avoiding HEAD requests to read the modification time

By default rclone will use the modification time of objects stored in
S3 for syncing.  This is stored in object metadata which unfortunately
takes an extra HEAD request to read which can be expensive (in time
and money).

The modification time is used by default for all operations that
require checking the time a file was last updated. It allows rclone to
treat the remote more like a true filesystem, but it is inefficient on
S3 because it requires an extra API call to retrieve the metadata.

The extra API calls can be avoided when syncing (using `rclone sync`
or `rclone copy`) in a few different ways, each with its own
tradeoffs.

- `--size-only`
    - Only checks the size of files.
    - Uses no extra transactions.
    - If the file doesn't change size then rclone won't detect it has
      changed.
    - `rclone sync --size-only /path/to/source s3:bucket`
- `--checksum`
    - Checks the size and MD5 checksum of files.
    - Uses no extra transactions.
    - The most accurate detection of changes possible.
    - Will cause the source to read an MD5 checksum which, if it is a
      local disk, will cause lots of disk activity.
    - If the source and destination are both S3 this is the
      **recommended** flag to use for maximum efficiency.
    - `rclone sync --checksum /path/to/source s3:bucket`
- `--update --use-server-modtime`
    - Uses no extra transactions.
    - Modification time becomes the time the object was uploaded.
    - For many operations this is sufficient to determine if it needs
      uploading.
    - Using `--update` along with `--use-server-modtime`, avoids the
      extra API call and uploads files whose local modification time
      is newer than the time it was last uploaded.
    - Files created with timestamps in the past will be missed by the sync.
    - `rclone sync --update --use-server-modtime /path/to/source s3:bucket`

These flags can and should be used in combination with `--fast-list` -
see below.

If using `rclone mount` or any command using the VFS (eg `rclone
serve`) commands then you might want to consider using the VFS flag
`--no-modtime` which will stop rclone reading the modification time
for every object. You could also use `--use-server-modtime` if you are
happy with the modification times of the objects being the time of
upload.

#### Avoiding GET requests to read directory listings

Rclone's default directory traversal is to process each directory
individually.  This takes one API call per directory.  Using the
`--fast-list` flag will read all info about the the objects into
memory first using a smaller number of API calls (one per 1000
objects). See the [rclone docs](/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

    rclone sync --fast-list --checksum /path/to/source s3:bucket

`--fast-list` trades off API transactions for memory use. As a rough
guide rclone uses 1k of memory per object stored, so using
`--fast-list` on a sync of a million objects will use roughly 1 GiB of
RAM.

If you are only copying a small number of files into a big repository
then using `--no-traverse` is a good idea. This finds objects directly
instead of through directory listings. You can do a "top-up" sync very
cheaply by using `--max-age` and `--no-traverse` to copy only recent
files, eg

    rclone copy --min-age 24h --no-traverse /path/to/source s3:bucket

You'd then do a full `rclone sync` less often.

Note that `--fast-list` isn't required in the top-up sync.

#### Avoiding HEAD requests after PUT

By default rclone will HEAD every object it uploads. It does this to
check the object got uploaded correctly.

You can disable this with the [--s3-no-head](#s3-no-head) option - see
there for more details.

Setting this flag increases the chance for undetected upload failures.

### Hashes ###

For small objects which weren't uploaded as multipart uploads (objects
sized below `--s3-upload-cutoff` if uploaded with rclone) rclone uses
the `ETag:` header as an MD5 checksum.

However for objects which were uploaded as multipart uploads or with
server side encryption (SSE-AWS or SSE-C) the `ETag` header is no
longer the MD5 sum of the data, so rclone adds an additional piece of
metadata `X-Amz-Meta-Md5chksum` which is a base64 encoded MD5 hash (in
the same format as is required for `Content-MD5`).

For large objects, calculating this hash can take some time so the
addition of this hash can be disabled with `--s3-disable-checksum`.
This will mean that these objects do not have an MD5 checksum.

Note that reading this from the object takes an additional `HEAD`
request as the metadata isn't returned in object listings.

### Cleanup ###

If you run `rclone cleanup s3:bucket` then it will remove all pending
multipart uploads older than 24 hours. You can use the `-i` flag to
see exactly what it will do. If you want more control over the expiry
date then run `rclone backend cleanup s3:bucket -o max-age=1h` to
expire all uploads older than one hour. You can use `rclone backend
list-multipart-uploads s3:bucket` to see the pending multipart
uploads.

#### Restricted filename characters

S3 allows any valid UTF-8 string as a key.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be [replaced](/overview/#invalid-utf8), as
they can't be used in XML.

The following characters are replaced since these are problematic when
dealing with the REST API:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／           |

The encoding will also encode these file names as they don't seem to
work with the SDK properly:

| File name | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----------:|
| .         | ．          |
| ..        | ．．         |

### Multipart uploads ###

rclone supports multipart uploads with S3 which means that it can
upload files bigger than 5 GiB.

Note that files uploaded *both* with multipart upload *and* through
crypt remotes do not have MD5 sums.

rclone switches from single part uploads to multipart uploads at the
point specified by `--s3-upload-cutoff`.  This can be a maximum of 5 GiB
and a minimum of 0 (ie always upload multipart files).

The chunk sizes used in the multipart upload are specified by
`--s3-chunk-size` and the number of chunks uploaded concurrently is
specified by `--s3-upload-concurrency`.

Multipart uploads will use `--transfers` * `--s3-upload-concurrency` *
`--s3-chunk-size` extra memory.  Single part uploads to not use extra
memory.

Single part transfers can be faster than multipart transfers or slower
depending on your latency from S3 - the more latency, the more likely
single part transfers will be faster.

Increasing `--s3-upload-concurrency` will increase throughput (8 would
be a sensible value) and increasing `--s3-chunk-size` also increases
throughput (16M would be sensible).  Increasing either of these will
use more memory.  The default values are high enough to gain most of
the possible performance without using too much memory.


### Buckets and Regions ###

With Amazon S3 you can list buckets (`rclone lsd`) using any region,
but you can only access the content of a bucket from the region it was
created in.  If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong region,
you will get an error, `incorrect region, the bucket is not in 'XXX'
region`.

### Authentication ###

There are a number of ways to supply `rclone` with a set of AWS
credentials, with and without using the environment.

The different authentication methods are tried in this order:

 - Directly in the rclone configuration file (`env_auth = false` in the config file):
   - `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` are required.
   - `session_token` can be optionally set when using AWS STS.
 - Runtime configuration (`env_auth = true` in the config file):
   - Export the following environment variables before running `rclone`:
     - Access Key ID: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`
     - Secret Access Key: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_SECRET_KEY`
     - Session Token: `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional)
   - Or, use a [named profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html):
     - Profile files are standard files used by AWS CLI tools
     - By default it will use the profile in your home directory (e.g. `~/.aws/credentials` on unix based systems) file and the "default" profile, to change set these environment variables:
         - `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` to control which file.
         - `AWS_PROFILE` to control which profile to use.
   - Or, run `rclone` in an ECS task with an IAM role (AWS only).
   - Or, run `rclone` on an EC2 instance with an IAM role (AWS only).
   - Or, run `rclone` in an EKS pod with an IAM role that is associated with a service account (AWS only).

If none of these option actually end up providing `rclone` with AWS
credentials then S3 interaction will be non-authenticated (see below).

### S3 Permissions ###

When using the `sync` subcommand of `rclone` the following minimum
permissions are required to be available on the bucket being written to:

* `ListBucket`
* `DeleteObject`
* `GetObject`
* `PutObject`
* `PutObjectACL`

When using the `lsd` subcommand, the `ListAllMyBuckets` permission is required.

Example policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::USER_SID:user/USER_NAME"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*",
              "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
        }	
    ]
}
```

Notes on above:

1. This is a policy that can be used when creating bucket. It assumes
   that `USER_NAME` has been created.
2. The Resource entry must include both resource ARNs, as one implies
   the bucket and the other implies the bucket's objects.

For reference, [here's an Ansible script](https://gist.github.com/ebridges/ebfc9042dd7c756cd101cfa807b7ae2b)
that will generate one or more buckets that will work with `rclone sync`.

### Key Management System (KMS) ###

If you are using server-side encryption with KMS then you must make
sure rclone is configured with `server_side_encryption = aws:kms`
otherwise you will find you can't transfer small objects - these will
create checksum errors.

### Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive ###

You can upload objects using the glacier storage class or transition them to glacier using a [lifecycle policy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-lifecycle.html).
The bucket can still be synced or copied into normally, but if rclone
tries to access data from the glacier storage class you will see an error like below.

    2017/09/11 19:07:43 Failed to sync: failed to open source object: Object in GLACIER, restore first: path/to/file

In this case you need to [restore](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/restore-archived-objects.html)
the object(s) in question before using rclone.

Note that rclone only speaks the S3 API it does not speak the Glacier
Vault API, so rclone cannot directly access Glacier Vaults.

#### --s3-location-constraint

Location constraint - must be set to match the Region.
Leave blank if not sure. Used when creating buckets only.

- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --s3-acl

Canned ACL used when creating buckets and storing or copying objects.

This ACL is used for creating objects and if bucket_acl isn't set, for creating buckets too.

For more info visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl

Note that this ACL is applied when server-side copying objects as S3
doesn't copy the ACL from the source but rather writes a fresh one.

- Config:      acl
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_ACL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - "default"
        - Owner gets Full_CONTROL. No one else has access rights (default).
    - "private"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. No one else has access rights (default).
    - "public-read"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AllUsers group gets READ access.
    - "public-read-write"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AllUsers group gets READ and WRITE access.
        - Granting this on a bucket is generally not recommended.
    - "authenticated-read"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AuthenticatedUsers group gets READ access.
    - "bucket-owner-read"
        - Object owner gets FULL_CONTROL. Bucket owner gets READ access.
        - If you specify this canned ACL when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.

### Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to s3 (Amazon S3 Compliant Storage Providers including AWS, Alibaba, Ceph, Digital Ocean, Dreamhost, IBM COS, Minio, and Tencent COS).

#### --s3-bucket-acl

Canned ACL used when creating buckets.

For more info visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl

Note that this ACL is applied when only when creating buckets.  If it
isn't set then "acl" is used instead.

- Config:      bucket_acl
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_BUCKET_ACL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - "private"

        - Granting this on a bucket is generally not recommended.
    - "authenticated-read"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AuthenticatedUsers group gets READ access.

#### --s3-requester-pays

Enables requester pays option when interacting with S3 bucket.

- Config:      requester_pays
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_REQUESTER_PAYS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-sse-customer-algorithm

If using SSE-C, the server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in S3.

- Config:      sse_customer_algorithm
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SSE_CUSTOMER_ALGORITHM
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - ""
        - None
    - "AES256"
        - AES256

#### --s3-sse-customer-key

If using SSE-C you must provide the secret encryption key used to encrypt/decrypt your data.

- Config:      sse_customer_key
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SSE_CUSTOMER_KEY
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - ""
        - None

#### --s3-sse-customer-key-md5

If using SSE-C you may provide the secret encryption key MD5 checksum (optional).

If you leave it blank, this is calculated automatically from the sse_customer_key provided.


- Config:      sse_customer_key_md5
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SSE_CUSTOMER_KEY_MD5
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - ""
        - None

#### --s3-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload

Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of chunk_size.
The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.

- Config:      upload_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     200M

#### --s3-chunk-size

Chunk size to use for uploading.

When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff or files with unknown
size (e.g. from "rclone rcat" or uploaded with "rclone mount" or google
photos or google docs) they will be uploaded as multipart uploads
using this chunk size.

Note that "--s3-upload-concurrency" chunks of this size are buffered
in memory per transfer.

If you are transferring large files over high-speed links and you have
enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.

Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a
large file of known size to stay below the 10,000 chunks limit.

Files of unknown size are uploaded with the configured
chunk_size. Since the default chunk size is 5 MiB and there can be at
most 10,000 chunks, this means that by default the maximum size of
a file you can stream upload is 48 GiB.  If you wish to stream upload
larger files then you will need to increase chunk_size.

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     5M

#### --s3-max-upload-parts

Maximum number of parts in a multipart upload.

This option defines the maximum number of multipart chunks to use
when doing a multipart upload.

This can be useful if a service does not support the AWS S3
specification of 10,000 chunks.

Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a
large file of a known size to stay below this number of chunks limit.


- Config:      max_upload_parts
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_MAX_UPLOAD_PARTS
- Type:        int
- Default:     10000

#### --s3-copy-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to multipart copy

Any files larger than this that need to be server-side copied will be
copied in chunks of this size.

The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.

- Config:      copy_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_COPY_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     4.656G

#### --s3-disable-checksum

Don't store MD5 checksum with object metadata

Normally rclone will calculate the MD5 checksum of the input before
uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great
for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files
to start uploading.

- Config:      disable_checksum
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_DISABLE_CHECKSUM
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-shared-credentials-file

Path to the shared credentials file

If env_auth = true then rclone can use a shared credentials file.

If this variable is empty rclone will look for the
"AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE" env variable. If the env value is empty
it will default to the current user's home directory.

    Linux/OSX: "$HOME/.aws/credentials"
    Windows:   "%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials"


- Config:      shared_credentials_file
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --s3-profile

Profile to use in the shared credentials file

If env_auth = true then rclone can use a shared credentials file. This
variable controls which profile is used in that file.

If empty it will default to the environment variable "AWS_PROFILE" or
"default" if that environment variable is also not set.


- Config:      profile
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_PROFILE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --s3-session-token

An AWS session token

- Config:      session_token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SESSION_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --s3-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently.

If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links
and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing
this may help to speed up the transfers.

- Config:      upload_concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     4

#### --s3-force-path-style

If true use path style access if false use virtual hosted style.

If this is true (the default) then rclone will use path style access,
if false then rclone will use virtual path style. See [the AWS S3
docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro)
for more info.

Some providers (e.g. AWS, Aliyun OSS, Netease COS, or Tencent COS) require this set to
false - rclone will do this automatically based on the provider
setting.

- Config:      force_path_style
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --s3-v2-auth

If true use v2 authentication.

If this is false (the default) then rclone will use v4 authentication.
If it is set then rclone will use v2 authentication.

Use this only if v4 signatures don't work, e.g. pre Jewel/v10 CEPH.

- Config:      v2_auth
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_V2_AUTH
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-use-accelerate-endpoint

If true use the AWS S3 accelerated endpoint.

See: [AWS S3 Transfer acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration-examples.html)

- Config:      use_accelerate_endpoint
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_USE_ACCELERATE_ENDPOINT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-leave-parts-on-error

If true avoid calling abort upload on a failure, leaving all successfully uploaded parts on S3 for manual recovery.

It should be set to true for resuming uploads across different sessions.

WARNING: Storing parts of an incomplete multipart upload counts towards space usage on S3 and will add additional costs if not cleaned up.


- Config:      leave_parts_on_error
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_LEAVE_PARTS_ON_ERROR
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-list-chunk

Size of listing chunk (response list for each ListObject S3 request).

This option is also known as "MaxKeys", "max-items", or "page-size" from the AWS S3 specification.
Most services truncate the response list to 1000 objects even if requested more than that.
In AWS S3 this is a global maximum and cannot be changed, see [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/ls.html).
In Ceph, this can be increased with the "rgw list buckets max chunk" option.


- Config:      list_chunk
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_LIST_CHUNK
- Type:        int
- Default:     1000

#### --s3-no-check-bucket

If set, don't attempt to check the bucket exists or create it

This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions
rclone does if you know the bucket exists already.

It can also be needed if the user you are using does not have bucket
creation permissions. Before v1.52.0 this would have passed silently
due to a bug.


- Config:      no_check_bucket
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_NO_CHECK_BUCKET
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-no-head

If set, don't HEAD uploaded objects to check integrity

This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions
rclone does.

Setting it means that if rclone receives a 200 OK message after
uploading an object with PUT then it will assume that it got uploaded
properly.

In particular it will assume:

- the metadata, including modtime, storage class and content type was as uploaded
- the size was as uploaded

It reads the following items from the response for a single part PUT:

- the MD5SUM
- The uploaded date

For multipart uploads these items aren't read.

If an source object of unknown length is uploaded then rclone **will** do a
HEAD request.

Setting this flag increases the chance for undetected upload failures,
in particular an incorrect size, so it isn't recommended for normal
operation. In practice the chance of an undetected upload failure is
very small even with this flag.


- Config:      no_head
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_NO_HEAD
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See: the [encoding section in the overview](/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --s3-memory-pool-flush-time

How often internal memory buffer pools will be flushed.
Uploads which requires additional buffers (f.e multipart) will use memory pool for allocations.
This option controls how often unused buffers will be removed from the pool.

- Config:      memory_pool_flush_time
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_MEMORY_POOL_FLUSH_TIME
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --s3-memory-pool-use-mmap

Whether to use mmap buffers in internal memory pool.

- Config:      memory_pool_use_mmap
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_MEMORY_POOL_USE_MMAP
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-disable-http2

Disable usage of http2 for S3 backends

There is currently an unsolved issue with the s3 (specifically minio) backend
and HTTP/2.  HTTP/2 is enabled by default for the s3 backend but can be
disabled here.  When the issue is solved this flag will be removed.

See: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4673, https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3631



- Config:      disable_http2
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_DISABLE_HTTP2
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

### Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the s3 backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See [the "rclone backend" command](/commands/rclone_backend/) for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](/rc/#backend/command).

#### restore

Restore objects from GLACIER to normal storage

    rclone backend restore remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command can be used to restore one or more objects from GLACIER
to normal storage.

Usage Examples:

    rclone backend restore s3:bucket/path/to/object [-o priority=PRIORITY] [-o lifetime=DAYS]
    rclone backend restore s3:bucket/path/to/directory [-o priority=PRIORITY] [-o lifetime=DAYS]
    rclone backend restore s3:bucket [-o priority=PRIORITY] [-o lifetime=DAYS]

This flag also obeys the filters. Test first with -i/--interactive or --dry-run flags

    rclone -i backend restore --include "*.txt" s3:bucket/path -o priority=Standard

All the objects shown will be marked for restore, then

    rclone backend restore --include "*.txt" s3:bucket/path -o priority=Standard

It returns a list of status dictionaries with Remote and Status
keys. The Status will be OK if it was successful or an error message
if not.

    [
        {
            "Status": "OK",
            "Path": "test.txt"
        },
        {
            "Status": "OK",
            "Path": "test/file4.txt"
        }
    ]



Options:

- "description": The optional description for the job.
- "lifetime": Lifetime of the active copy in days
- "priority": Priority of restore: Standard|Expedited|Bulk

#### list-multipart-uploads

List the unfinished multipart uploads

    rclone backend list-multipart-uploads remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command lists the unfinished multipart uploads in JSON format.

    rclone backend list-multipart s3:bucket/path/to/object

It returns a dictionary of buckets with values as lists of unfinished
multipart uploads.

You can call it with no bucket in which case it lists all bucket, with
a bucket or with a bucket and path.

    {
      "rclone": [
        {
          "Initiated": "2020-06-26T14:20:36Z",
          "Initiator": {
            "DisplayName": "XXX",
            "ID": "arn:aws:iam::XXX:user/XXX"
          },
          "Key": "KEY",
          "Owner": {
            "DisplayName": null,
            "ID": "XXX"
          },
          "StorageClass": "STANDARD",
          "UploadId": "XXX"
        }
      ],
      "rclone-1000files": [],
      "rclone-dst": []
    }



#### cleanup

Remove unfinished multipart uploads.

    rclone backend cleanup remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command removes unfinished multipart uploads of age greater than
max-age which defaults to 24 hours.

Note that you can use -i/--dry-run with this command to see what it
would do.

    rclone backend cleanup s3:bucket/path/to/object
    rclone backend cleanup -o max-age=7w s3:bucket/path/to/object

Durations are parsed as per the rest of rclone, 2h, 7d, 7w etc.


Options:

- "max-age": Max age of upload to delete

{{< rem autogenerated options stop >}}

### Anonymous access to public buckets ###

If you want to use rclone to access a public bucket, configure with a
blank `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`.  Your config should end
up looking like this:

```
[anons3]
type = s3
provider = AWS
env_auth = false
access_key_id = 
secret_access_key = 
region = us-east-1
endpoint = 
location_constraint = 
acl = private
server_side_encryption = 
storage_class = 
```

Then use it as normal with the name of the public bucket, e.g.

    rclone lsd anons3:1000genomes

You will be able to list and copy data but not upload it.

### Ceph ###

[Ceph](https://ceph.com/) is an open source unified, distributed
storage system designed for excellent performance, reliability and
scalability.  It has an S3 compatible object storage interface.

To use rclone with Ceph, configure as above but leave the region blank
and set the endpoint.  You should end up with something like this in
your config:


```
[ceph]
type = s3
provider = Ceph
env_auth = false
access_key_id = XXX
secret_access_key = YYY
region =
endpoint = https://ceph.endpoint.example.com
location_constraint =
acl =
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
```

If you are using an older version of CEPH, e.g. 10.2.x Jewel, then you
may need to supply the parameter `--s3-upload-cutoff 0` or put this in
the config file as `upload_cutoff 0` to work around a bug which causes
uploading of small files to fail.

Note also that Ceph sometimes puts `/` in the passwords it gives
users.  If you read the secret access key using the command line tools
you will get a JSON blob with the `/` escaped as `\/`.  Make sure you
only write `/` in the secret access key.

Eg the dump from Ceph looks something like this (irrelevant keys
removed).

```
{
    "user_id": "xxx",
    "display_name": "xxxx",
    "keys": [
        {
            "user": "xxx",
            "access_key": "xxxxxx",
            "secret_key": "xxxxxx\/xxxx"
        }
    ],
}
```

Because this is a json dump, it is encoding the `/` as `\/`, so if you
use the secret key as `xxxxxx/xxxx`  it will work fine.

### Dreamhost ###

Dreamhost [DreamObjects](https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/) is
an object storage system based on CEPH.

To use rclone with Dreamhost, configure as above but leave the region blank
and set the endpoint.  You should end up with something like this in
your config:

```
[dreamobjects]
type = s3
provider = DreamHost
env_auth = false
access_key_id = your_access_key
secret_access_key = your_secret_key
region =
endpoint = objects-us-west-1.dream.io
location_constraint =
acl = private
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
```

### DigitalOcean Spaces ###

[Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/object-storage/) is an [S3-interoperable](https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/spaces/) object storage service from cloud provider DigitalOcean.

To connect to DigitalOcean Spaces you will need an access key and secret key. These can be retrieved on the "[Applications & API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/api/tokens)" page of the DigitalOcean control panel. They will be needed when prompted by `rclone config` for your `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`.

When prompted for a `region` or `location_constraint`, press enter to use the default value. The region must be included in the `endpoint` setting (e.g. `nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com`). The default values can be used for other settings.

Going through the whole process of creating a new remote by running `rclone config`, each prompt should be answered as shown below:

```
Storage> s3
env_auth> 1
access_key_id> YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key> YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region>
endpoint> nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
location_constraint>
acl>
storage_class>
```

The resulting configuration file should look like:

```
[spaces]
type = s3
provider = DigitalOcean
env_auth = false
access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region =
endpoint = nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
location_constraint =
acl =
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
```

Once configured, you can create a new Space and begin copying files. For example:

```
rclone mkdir spaces:my-new-space
rclone copy /path/to/files spaces:my-new-space
```

### IBM COS (S3) ###

Information stored with IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted and dispersed across multiple geographic locations, and accessed through an implementation of the S3 API. This service makes use of the distributed storage technologies provided by IBM’s Cloud Object Storage System (formerly Cleversafe). For more information visit: (http://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage)

To configure access to IBM COS S3, follow the steps below:

1. Run rclone config and select n for a new remote.
```

		-1 2018-02-14 20:16:39        -1 newbucket
	3)	List contents of a bucket.
		rclone ls IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket
		18685952 test.exe
	4)	Copy a file from local to remote.
		rclone copy /Users/file.txt IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket
	5)	Copy a file from remote to local.
		rclone copy IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket/file.txt .
	6)	Delete a file on remote.
		rclone delete IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket/file.txt
```

### Minio ###

[Minio](https://minio.io/) is an object storage server built for cloud application developers and devops.

It is very easy to install and provides an S3 compatible server which can be used by rclone.

To use it, install Minio following the instructions [here](https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide).

When it configures itself Minio will print something like this

```
Endpoint:  http://192.168.1.106:9000  http://172.23.0.1:9000
AccessKey: USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
SecretKey: MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
Region:    us-east-1
SQS ARNs:  arn:minio:sqs:us-east-1:1:redis arn:minio:sqs:us-east-1:2:redis

Browser Access:
   http://192.168.1.106:9000  http://172.23.0.1:9000

Command-line Access: https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide
   $ mc config host add myminio http://192.168.1.106:9000 USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03

Object API (Amazon S3 compatible):
   Go:         https://docs.minio.io/docs/golang-client-quickstart-guide
   Java:       https://docs.minio.io/docs/java-client-quickstart-guide
   Python:     https://docs.minio.io/docs/python-client-quickstart-guide
   JavaScript: https://docs.minio.io/docs/javascript-client-quickstart-guide
   .NET:       https://docs.minio.io/docs/dotnet-client-quickstart-guide

Drive Capacity: 26 GiB Free, 165 GiB Total
```

These details need to go into `rclone config` like this.  Note that it
is important to put the region in as stated above.

```
env_auth> 1
access_key_id> USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
secret_access_key> MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
region> us-east-1
endpoint> http://192.168.1.106:9000
location_constraint>
server_side_encryption>
```

Which makes the config file look like this

```
[minio]
type = s3
provider = Minio
env_auth = false
access_key_id = USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
secret_access_key = MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
region = us-east-1
endpoint = http://192.168.1.106:9000
location_constraint =
server_side_encryption =
```

So once set up, for example to copy files into a bucket

```
rclone copy /path/to/files minio:bucket
```

### Scaleway {#scaleway}

[Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/object-storage/) The Object Storage platform allows you to store anything from backups, logs and web assets to documents and photos.
Files can be dropped from the Scaleway console or transferred through our API and CLI or using any S3-compatible tool.

Scaleway provides an S3 interface which can be configured for use with rclone like this:

```
[scaleway]
type = s3
provider = Scaleway
env_auth = false
endpoint = s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
access_key_id = SCWXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
secret_access_key = 1111111-2222-3333-44444-55555555555555
region = nl-ams

### Netease NOS

For Netease NOS configure as per the configurator `rclone config`
setting the provider `Netease`.  This will automatically set
`force_path_style = false` which is necessary for it to run properly.

### Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the S3 backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
See [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)
