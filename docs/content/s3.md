{{< icon "fab fa-amazon" >}} Amazon S3 Storage Providers
--------------------------------------------------------

The S3 backend can be used with a number of different providers:

{{< provider_list >}}
{{< provider name="AWS S3" home="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" config="/s3/#amazon-s3" start="true" >}}
{{< provider name="Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) Object Storage System (OSS)" home="https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/oss/" config="/s3/#alibaba-oss" >}}
{{< provider name="Ceph" home="http://ceph.com/" config="/s3/#ceph" >}}
{{< provider name="DigitalOcean Spaces" home="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/object-storage/" config="/s3/#digitalocean-spaces" >}}
{{< provider name="Dreamhost" home="https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/" config="/s3/#dreamhost" >}}
{{< provider name="IBM COS S3" home="http://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage" config="/s3/#ibm-cos-s3" >}}
{{< provider name="Minio" home="https://www.minio.io/" config="/s3/#minio" >}}
{{< provider name="Scaleway" home="https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/" config="/s3/#scaleway" >}}
{{< provider name="StackPath" home="https://www.stackpath.com/products/object-storage/" config="/s3/#stackpath" >}}
{{< provider name="Wasabi" home="https://wasabi.com/" config="/s3/#wasabi" end="true" >}}
{{< /provider_list >}}

Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, eg `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

Once you have made a remote (see the provider specific section above)
you can use it like this:

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:bucket

## AWS S3 {#amazon-s3}

Here is an example of making an s3 configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

### --fast-list ###

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

### --update and --use-server-modtime ###

As noted below, the modified time is stored on metadata on the object. It is
used by default for all operations that require checking the time a file was
last updated. It allows rclone to treat the remote more like a true filesystem,
but it is inefficient because it requires an extra API call to retrieve the
metadata.

For many operations, the time the object was last uploaded to the remote is
sufficient to determine if it is "dirty". By using `--update` along with
`--use-server-modtime`, you can avoid the extra API call and simply upload
files whose local modtime is newer than the time it was last uploaded.

### Modified time ###

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
`X-Amz-Meta-Mtime` as floating point since the epoch accurate to 1 ns.

If the modification time needs to be updated rclone will attempt to perform a server
side copy to update the modification if the object can be copied in a single part.
In the case the object is larger than 5Gb or is in Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive
storage the object will be uploaded rather than copied.

### Cleanup ###

If you run `rclone cleanup s3:bucket` then it will remove all pending
multipart uploads older than 24 hours. You can use the `-i` flag to
see exactly what it will do. If you want more control over the expiry
date then run `rclone backend cleanup s3:bucket -o max-age=1h` to
expire all uploads older than one hour. You can use `rclone backend
list-multipart-uploads s3:bucket` to see the pending multipart
uploads.

#### Restricted filename characters

S3 allows any valid UTF-8 string as a key.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be [replaced](/overview/#invalid-utf8), as
they can't be used in XML.

The following characters are replaced since these are problematic when
dealing with the REST API:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／           |

The encoding will also encode these file names as they don't seem to
work with the SDK properly:

| File name | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----------:|
| .         | ．          |
| ..        | ．．         |

### Multipart uploads ###

rclone supports multipart uploads with S3 which means that it can
upload files bigger than 5GB.

Note that files uploaded *both* with multipart upload *and* through
crypt remotes do not have MD5 sums.

rclone switches from single part uploads to multipart uploads at the
point specified by `--s3-upload-cutoff`.  This can be a maximum of 5GB
and a minimum of 0 (ie always upload multipart files).

The chunk sizes used in the multipart upload are specified by
`--s3-chunk-size` and the number of chunks uploaded concurrently is
specified by `--s3-upload-concurrency`.

Multipart uploads will use `--transfers` * `--s3-upload-concurrency` *
`--s3-chunk-size` extra memory.  Single part uploads to not use extra
memory.

Single part transfers can be faster than multipart transfers or slower
depending on your latency from S3 - the more latency, the more likely
single part transfers will be faster.

Increasing `--s3-upload-concurrency` will increase throughput (8 would
be a sensible value) and increasing `--s3-chunk-size` also increases
throughput (16M would be sensible).  Increasing either of these will
use more memory.  The default values are high enough to gain most of
the possible performance without using too much memory.


### Buckets and Regions ###

With Amazon S3 you can list buckets (`rclone lsd`) using any region,
but you can only access the content of a bucket from the region it was
created in.  If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong region,
you will get an error, `incorrect region, the bucket is not in 'XXX'
region`.

### Authentication ###

There are a number of ways to supply `rclone` with a set of AWS
credentials, with and without using the environment.

The different authentication methods are tried in this order:

 - Directly in the rclone configuration file (`env_auth = false` in the config file):
   - `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` are required.
   - `session_token` can be optionally set when using AWS STS.
 - Runtime configuration (`env_auth = true` in the config file):
   - Export the following environment variables before running `rclone`:
     - Access Key ID: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`
     - Secret Access Key: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_SECRET_KEY`
     - Session Token: `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional)
   - Or, use a [named profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html):
     - Profile files are standard files used by AWS CLI tools
     - By default it will use the profile in your home directory (eg `~/.aws/credentials` on unix based systems) file and the "default" profile, to change set these environment variables:
         - `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` to control which file.
         - `AWS_PROFILE` to control which profile to use.
   - Or, run `rclone` in an ECS task with an IAM role (AWS only).
   - Or, run `rclone` on an EC2 instance with an IAM role (AWS only).
   - Or, run `rclone` in an EKS pod with an IAM role that is associated with a service account (AWS only).

If none of these option actually end up providing `rclone` with AWS
credentials then S3 interaction will be non-authenticated (see below).

### S3 Permissions ###

When using the `sync` subcommand of `rclone` the following minimum
permissions are required to be available on the bucket being written to:

* `ListBucket`
* `DeleteObject`
* `GetObject`
* `PutObject`
* `PutObjectACL`

When using the `lsd` subcommand, the `ListAllMyBuckets` permission is required.

Example policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::USER_SID:user/USER_NAME"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*",
              "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
        }	
    ]
}
```

Notes on above:

1. This is a policy that can be used when creating bucket. It assumes
   that `USER_NAME` has been created.
2. The Resource entry must include both resource ARNs, as one implies
   the bucket and the other implies the bucket's objects.

For reference, [here's an Ansible script](https://gist.github.com/ebridges/ebfc9042dd7c756cd101cfa807b7ae2b)
that will generate one or more buckets that will work with `rclone sync`.

### Key Management System (KMS) ###

If you are using server side encryption with KMS then you will find
you can't transfer small objects.  As a work-around you can use the
`--ignore-checksum` flag.

A proper fix is being worked on in [issue #1824](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1824).

### Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive ###

You can upload objects using the glacier storage class or transition them to glacier using a [lifecycle policy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-lifecycle.html).
The bucket can still be synced or copied into normally, but if rclone
tries to access data from the glacier storage class you will see an error like below.

    2017/09/11 19:07:43 Failed to sync: failed to open source object: Object in GLACIER, restore first: path/to/file

In this case you need to [restore](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/restore-archived-objects.html)
the object(s) in question before using rclone.

Note that rclone only speaks the S3 API it does not speak the Glacier
Vault API, so rclone cannot directly access Glacier Vaults.

- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - ""
        - None

#### --s3-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload

Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of chunk_size.
The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5GB.

- Config:      upload_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     200M

#### --s3-chunk-size

Chunk size to use for uploading.

When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff or files with unknown
size (eg from "rclone rcat" or uploaded with "rclone mount" or google
photos or google docs) they will be uploaded as multipart uploads
using this chunk size.

Note that "--s3-upload-concurrency" chunks of this size are buffered
in memory per transfer.

If you are transferring large files over high speed links and you have
enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.

Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a
large file of known size to stay below the 10,000 chunks limit.

Files of unknown size are uploaded with the configured
chunk_size. Since the default chunk size is 5MB and there can be at
most 10,000 chunks, this means that by default the maximum size of
file you can stream upload is 48GB.  If you wish to stream upload
larger files then you will need to increase chunk_size.

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     5M

#### --s3-copy-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to multipart copy

Any files larger than this that need to be server side copied will be
copied in chunks of this size.

The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5GB.

- Config:      copy_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_COPY_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     5G

#### --s3-disable-checksum

Don't store MD5 checksum with object metadata

Normally rclone will calculate the MD5 checksum of the input before
uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great
for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files
to start uploading.

- Config:      disable_checksum
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_DISABLE_CHECKSUM
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-session-token

- Config:      session_token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SESSION_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --s3-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently.

If you are uploading small numbers of large file over high speed link
and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing
this may help to speed up the transfers.

- Config:      upload_concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     4

#### --s3-force-path-style

If true use path style access if false use virtual hosted style.

If this is true (the default) then rclone will use path style access,
if false then rclone will use virtual path style. See [the AWS S3
docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro)
for more info.

Some providers (eg AWS, Aliyun OSS or Netease COS) require this set to
false - rclone will do this automatically based on the provider
setting.

- Config:      force_path_style
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --s3-v2-auth

If true use v2 authentication.

If this is false (the default) then rclone will use v4 authentication.
If it is set then rclone will use v2 authentication.

Use this only if v4 signatures don't work, eg pre Jewel/v10 CEPH.

- Config:      v2_auth
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_V2_AUTH
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-use-accelerate-endpoint

If true use the AWS S3 accelerated endpoint.

See: [AWS S3 Transfer acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration-examples.html)

- Config:      use_accelerate_endpoint
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_USE_ACCELERATE_ENDPOINT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-leave-parts-on-error

If true avoid calling abort upload on a failure, leaving all successfully uploaded parts on S3 for manual recovery.

It should be set to true for resuming uploads across different sessions.

WARNING: Storing parts of an incomplete multipart upload counts towards space usage on S3 and will add additional costs if not cleaned up.


- Config:      leave_parts_on_error
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_LEAVE_PARTS_ON_ERROR
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-list-chunk

Size of listing chunk (response list for each ListObject S3 request).

This option is also known as "MaxKeys", "max-items", or "page-size" from the AWS S3 specification.
Most services truncate the response list to 1000 objects even if requested more than that.
In AWS S3 this is a global maximum and cannot be changed, see [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/ls.html).
In Ceph, this can be increased with the "rgw list buckets max chunk" option.


- Config:      list_chunk
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_LIST_CHUNK
- Type:        int
- Default:     1000

#### --s3-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See: the [encoding section in the overview](/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --s3-memory-pool-flush-time

How often internal memory buffer pools will be flushed.
Uploads which requires additional buffers (f.e multipart) will use memory pool for allocations.
This option controls how often unused buffers will be removed from the pool.

- Config:      memory_pool_flush_time
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_MEMORY_POOL_FLUSH_TIME
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --s3-memory-pool-use-mmap

Whether to use mmap buffers in internal memory pool.

- Config:      memory_pool_use_mmap
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_MEMORY_POOL_USE_MMAP
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

### Anonymous access to public buckets ###

If you want to use rclone to access a public bucket, configure with a
blank `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`.  Your config should end
up looking like this:

```
[anons3]
type = s3
provider = AWS
env_auth = false
access_key_id = 
secret_access_key = 
region = us-east-1
endpoint = 
location_constraint = 
acl = private
server_side_encryption = 
storage_class = 
```

Then use it as normal with the name of the public bucket, eg

    rclone lsd anons3:1000genomes

You will be able to list and copy data but not upload it.

### Ceph ###

[Ceph](https://ceph.com/) is an open source unified, distributed
storage system designed for excellent performance, reliability and
scalability.  It has an S3 compatible object storage interface.

To use rclone with Ceph, configure as above but leave the region blank
and set the endpoint.  You should end up with something like this in
your config:


```
[ceph]
type = s3
provider = Ceph
env_auth = false
access_key_id = XXX
secret_access_key = YYY
region =
endpoint = https://ceph.endpoint.example.com
location_constraint =
acl =
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
```

If you are using an older version of CEPH, eg 10.2.x Jewel, then you
may need to supply the parameter `--s3-upload-cutoff 0` or put this in
the config file as `upload_cutoff 0` to work around a bug which causes
uploading of small files to fail.

Note also that Ceph sometimes puts `/` in the passwords it gives
users.  If you read the secret access key using the command line tools
you will get a JSON blob with the `/` escaped as `\/`.  Make sure you
only write `/` in the secret access key.

Eg the dump from Ceph looks something like this (irrelevant keys
removed).

```
{
    "user_id": "xxx",
    "display_name": "xxxx",
    "keys": [
        {
            "user": "xxx",
            "access_key": "xxxxxx",
            "secret_key": "xxxxxx\/xxxx"
        }
    ],
}
```

Because this is a json dump, it is encoding the `/` as `\/`, so if you
use the secret key as `xxxxxx/xxxx`  it will work fine.

### Dreamhost ###

Dreamhost [DreamObjects](https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/) is
an object storage system based on CEPH.

To use rclone with Dreamhost, configure as above but leave the region blank
and set the endpoint.  You should end up with something like this in
your config:

```
[dreamobjects]
type = s3
provider = DreamHost
env_auth = false
access_key_id = your_access_key
secret_access_key = your_secret_key
region =
endpoint = objects-us-west-1.dream.io
location_constraint =
acl = private
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
```

### DigitalOcean Spaces ###

[Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/object-storage/) is an [S3-interoperable](https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/spaces/) object storage service from cloud provider DigitalOcean.

To connect to DigitalOcean Spaces you will need an access key and secret key. These can be retrieved on the "[Applications & API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/api/tokens)" page of the DigitalOcean control panel. They will be needed when prompted by `rclone config` for your `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`.

When prompted for a `region` or `location_constraint`, press enter to use the default value. The region must be included in the `endpoint` setting (e.g. `nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com`). The default values can be used for other settings.

Going through the whole process of creating a new remote by running `rclone config`, each prompt should be answered as shown below:

```
Storage> s3
env_auth> 1
access_key_id> YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key> YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region>
endpoint> nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
location_constraint>
acl>
storage_class>
```

The resulting configuration file should look like:

```
[spaces]
type = s3
provider = DigitalOcean
env_auth = false
access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region =
endpoint = nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
location_constraint =
acl =
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
```

Once configured, you can create a new Space and begin copying files. For example:

```
rclone mkdir spaces:my-new-space
rclone copy /path/to/files spaces:my-new-space
```

### IBM COS (S3) ###

Information stored with IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted and dispersed across multiple geographic locations, and accessed through an implementation of the S3 API.

      \ "authenticated-read"
acl> 1
```


12. Review the displayed configuration and accept to save the "remote" then quit. The config file should look like this
```
	[xxx]
	type = s3
	Provider = IBMCOS
	access_key_id = xxx
	secret_access_key = yyy
	endpoint = s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net
	location_constraint = us-standard
	acl = private
```

13. Execute rclone commands
```
	1)	Create a bucket.
		rclone mkdir IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket
	2)	List available buckets.
		rclone lsd IBM-COS-XREGION:
		-1 2017-11-08 21:16:22        -1 test
		-1 2018-02-14 20:16:39        -1 newbucket
	3)	List contents of a bucket.

		rclone copy IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket/file.txt .
	6)	Delete a file on remote.
		rclone delete IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket/file.txt
```

### Minio ###

[Minio](https://minio.io/) is an object storage server built for cloud application developers and devops.

It is very easy to install and provides an S3 compatible server which can be used by rclone.

To use it, install Minio following the instructions [here](https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide).

When it configures itself Minio will print something like this

```
Endpoint:  http://192.168.1.106:9000  http://172.23.0.1:9000
AccessKey: USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
SecretKey: MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
Region:    us-east-1
SQS ARNs:  arn:minio:sqs:us-east-1:1:redis arn:minio:sqs:us-east-1:2:redis

Browser Access:
   http://192.168.1.106:9000  http://172.23.0.1:9000

Command-line Access: https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide
   $ mc config host add myminio http://192.168.1.106:9000 USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03

Object API (Amazon S3 compatible):
   Go:         https://docs.minio.io/docs/golang-client-quickstart-guide
   Java:       https://docs.minio.io/docs/java-client-quickstart-guide
   Python:     https://docs.minio.io/docs/python-client-quickstart-guide
   JavaScript: https://docs.minio.io/docs/javascript-client-quickstart-guide
   .NET:       https://docs.minio.io/docs/dotnet-client-quickstart-guide

Drive Capacity: 26 GiB Free, 165 GiB Total
```

These details need to go into `rclone config` like this.  Note that it
is important to put the region in as stated above.

```
env_auth> 1
access_key_id> USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
secret_access_key> MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
region> us-east-1
endpoint> http://192.168.1.106:9000
location_constraint>
server_side_encryption>
```

Which makes the config file look like this

```
[minio]
type = s3
provider = Minio
env_auth = false
access_key_id = USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
secret_access_key = MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
region = us-east-1
endpoint = http://192.168.1.106:9000
location_constraint =
server_side_encryption =
```

So once set up, for example to copy files into a bucket

```
rclone copy /path/to/files minio:bucket
```

### Scaleway {#scaleway}

[Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/object-storage/) The Object Storage platform allows you to store anything from backups, logs and web assets to documents and photos.
