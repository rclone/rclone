# {{< icon "fas fa-at" >}} Mail.ru Cloud

[Mail.ru Cloud](https://cloud.mail.ru/) is a cloud storage provided by a Russian internet company [Mail.Ru Group](https://mail.ru). The official desktop client is [Disk-O:](https://disk-o.cloud/en), available on Windows and Mac OS.

## Features highlights

- Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`
- Files have a `last modified time` property, directories don't
- Deleted files are by default moved to the trash
- Files and directories can be shared via public links
- Partial uploads or streaming are not supported, file size must be known before upload
- Maximum file size is limited to 2G for a free account, unlimited for paid accounts
- Storage keeps hash for all files and performs transparent deduplication,
  the hash algorithm is a modified SHA1
- If a particular file is already present in storage, one can quickly submit file hash
  instead of long file upload (this optimization is supported by rclone)

## Configuration

Here is an example of making a mailru configuration.

First create a Mail.ru Cloud account and choose a tariff.

You will need to log in and create an app password for rclone. Rclone
**will not work** with your normal username and password - it will
give an error like `oauth2: server response missing access_token`.

- Click on your user icon in the top right
- Go to Security / "Пароль и безопасность"
- Click password for apps / "Пароли для внешних приложений"
- Add the password - give it a name - eg "rclone"
- Select the permissions level. For some reason just "Full access to Cloud" (WebDav) doesn't work for Rclone currently. You have to select "Full access to Mail, Cloud and Calendar" (all protocols). ([thread on forum.rclone.org](https://forum.rclone.org/t/failed-to-create-file-system-for-mailru-failed-to-authorize-oauth2-invalid-username-or-password-username-or-password-is-incorrect/49298))
- Copy the password and use this password below - your normal login password won't work.

Now run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```

- pass: *** ENCRYPTED ***
- speedup_enable: true

y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Configuration of this backend does not require a local web browser.
You can use the configured backend as shown below:

See top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote path, deleting any
excess files in the path.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:directory

### Modification times and hashes

Files support a modification time attribute with up to 1 second precision.
Directories do not have a modification time, which is shown as "Jan 1 1970".

File hashes are supported, with a custom Mail.ru algorithm based on SHA1.
If file size is less than or equal to the SHA1 block size (20 bytes),
its hash is simply its data right-padded with zero bytes.
Hashes of a larger file is computed as a SHA1 of the file data
bytes concatenated with a decimal representation of the data length.

### Emptying Trash

Removing a file or directory actually moves it to the trash, which is not
visible to rclone but can be seen in a web browser. The trashed file
still occupies part of total quota. If you wish to empty your trash
and free some quota, you can use the `rclone cleanup remote:` command,
which will permanently delete all your trashed files.
This command does not take any path arguments.

### Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the `rclone about remote:`
command which will display your usage limit (quota) and the current usage.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊          |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：          |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜          |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞          |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？          |
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼          |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to mailru (Mail.ru Cloud).

#### --mailru-client-id

OAuth Client Id.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

- Config:      client_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MAILRU_CLIENT_ID
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --mailru-client-secret

OAuth Client Secret.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

- Config:      client_secret
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MAILRU_CLIENT_SECRET
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --mailru-user

User name (usually email).

Properties:

- Config:      user
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MAILRU_USER
- Type:        string
- Required:    true

#### --mailru-pass

Password.

This must be an app password - rclone will not work with your normal
password. See the Configuration section in the docs for how to make an
app password.


**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](/commands/rclone_obscure/).

Properties:

- Config:      pass

- Type:        string
- Required:    true

#### --mailru-speedup-enable

Skip full upload if there is another file with same data hash.

This feature is called "speedup" or "put by hash". It is especially efficient
in case of generally available files like popular books, video or audio clips,
because files are searched by hash in all accounts of all mailru users.
It is meaningless and ineffective if source file is unique or encrypted.
Please note that rclone may need local memory and disk space to calculate
content hash in advance and decide whether full upload is required.
Also, if rclone does not know file size in advance (e.g. in case of
streaming or partial uploads), it will not even try this optimization.

Properties:

- Config:      speedup_enable
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MAILRU_SPEEDUP_ENABLE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --mailru-quirks

Comma separated list of internal maintenance flags.

This option must not be used by an ordinary user. It is intended only to
facilitate remote troubleshooting of backend issues. Strict meaning of

## Limitations

File size limits depend on your account. A single file size is limited by 2G
for a free account and unlimited for paid tariffs. Please refer to the Mail.ru
site for the total uploaded size limits.

Note that Mailru is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".
