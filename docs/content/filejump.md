# {{< icon "fa fa-cloud" >}} FileJump

[FileJump](https://filejump.com) is a cloud storage service that provides
secure file storage with WebDAV access for desktop and mobile synchronization.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `filejump`. First run:

```console
rclone config
```

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```text
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> filejump
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]

   \ "webdav"
[snip]
Storage> webdav

url> https://uploads.filejump.com/dav/
Name of the WebDAV site/service/software you are using.

Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: webdav
- url: https://uploads.filejump.com/dav/
- vendor: filejump

- pass: *** ENCRYPTED ***
Keep this "filejump" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this:

List directories in top level of your FileJump:

```console
rclone lsd filejump:
```

List all the files in your FileJump:

```console
rclone ls filejump:
```

Copy a local directory to FileJump:

```console
rclone copy /home/source filejump:backup
```

Sync a local directory with FileJump:

```console
rclone sync -i /home/source filejump:backup
```

### Modified time

FileJump supports modified times using the `X-OC-Mtime` header.
This means rclone can detect which files have changed and only
transfer those.

### Checksums

FileJump supports SHA-256 checksums. These are reported via
OwnCloud-style `<oc:checksums>` properties in PROPFIND responses
and can be sent on upload via the `OC-Checksum` header for
server-side integrity verification.

This means rclone can check the integrity of files after upload and
use checksums for `--checksum` based syncs, which is more reliable
than modified time comparison.

### WebDAV URL

The WebDAV endpoint for FileJump is:

```
https://uploads.filejump.com/dav/
```

### Authentication

FileJump WebDAV uses your account email as the username and your
WebDAV token as the password. You can find your WebDAV token in
your FileJump account settings under the WebDAV section.

### Limitations

- Maximum file size depends on your FileJump plan
- Rate limits may apply for very high-frequency operations
