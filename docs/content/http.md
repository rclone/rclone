# {{< icon "fa fa-globe" >}} HTTP

The HTTP remote is a read only remote for reading files of a
webserver.  The webserver should provide file listings which rclone
will read and turn into a remote.  This has been tested with common
webservers such as Apache/Nginx/Caddy and will likely work with file
listings from most web servers.  (If it doesn't then please file an
issue, or send a pull request!)

Paths are specified as `remote:` or `remote:path`.

The `remote:` represents the configured [url](#http-url), and any path following
it will be resolved relative to this url, according to the URL standard. This
means with remote url `https://beta.rclone.org/branch` and path `fix`, the
resolved URL will be `https://beta.rclone.org/branch/fix`, while with path
`/fix` the resolved URL will be `https://beta.rclone.org/fix` as the absolute
path is resolved from the root of the domain.

If the path following the `remote:` ends with `/` it will be assumed to point
to a directory. If the path does not end with `/`, then a HEAD request is sent
and the response used to decide if it it is treated as a file or a directory
(run with `-vv` to see details). When [--http-no-head](#http-no-head) is
specified, a path without ending `/` is always assumed to be a file. If rclone
incorrectly assumes the path is a file, the solution is to specify the path with
ending `/`. When you know the path is a directory, ending it with `/` is always
better as it avoids the initial HEAD request.

To just download a single file it is easier to use
[copyurl](/commands/rclone_copyurl/).

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First
run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / http Connection
   \ "http"
[snip]
Storage> http
URL of http host to connect to
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Connect to example.com
   \ "https://example.com"
url> https://beta.rclone.org
Remote config
--------------------
[remote]
url = https://beta.rclone.org
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
remote               http

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all the top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync the remote `directory` to `/home/local/directory`, deleting any excess files.

    rclone sync -i remote:directory /home/local/directory

### Read only

This remote is read only - you can't upload files to an HTTP server.

### Modified time

Most HTTP servers store time accurate to 1 second.

### Checksum

No checksums are stored.

### Usage without a config file

Since the http remote only has one config parameter it is easy to use
without a config file:

    rclone lsd --http-url https://beta.rclone.org :http:

or:

    rclone lsd :http,url='https://beta.rclone.org':

{{< rem autogenerated options start" - DO NOT EDIT - instead edit fs.RegInfo in backend/http/http.go then run make backenddocs" >}}
### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to http (http Connection).

#### --http-url

URL of http host to connect to.

E.g. "https://example.com", or "https://user:pass@example.com" to use a username and password.

Properties:

- Config:      url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HTTP_URL
- Type:        string
- Required:    true

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to http (http Connection).

#### --http-headers

Set HTTP headers for all transactions.

Use this to set additional HTTP headers for all transactions.

The input format is comma separated list of key,value pairs.  Standard
[CSV encoding](https://godoc.org/encoding/csv) may be used.

For example, to set a Cookie use 'Cookie,name=value', or '"Cookie","name=value"'.

You can set multiple headers, e.g. '"Cookie","name=value","Authorization","xxx"'.

Properties:

- Config:      headers
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HTTP_HEADERS
- Type:        CommaSepList
- Default:     

#### --http-no-slash

Set this if the site doesn't end directories with /.

Use this if your target website does not use / on the end of
directories.

A / on the end of a path is how rclone normally tells the difference
between files and directories.  If this flag is set, then rclone will
treat all files with Content-Type: text/html as directories and read
URLs from them rather than downloading them.

Note that this may cause rclone to confuse genuine HTML files with
directories.

Properties:

- Config:      no_slash
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HTTP_NO_SLASH
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --http-no-head

Don't use HEAD requests.

HEAD requests are mainly used to find file sizes in dir listing.
If your site is being very slow to load then you can try this option.
Normally rclone does a HEAD request for each potential file in a
directory listing to:

- find its size
- check it really exists
- check to see if it is a directory

If you set this option, rclone will not do the HEAD request. This will mean
that directory listings are much quicker, but rclone won't have the times or
sizes of any files, and some files that don't exist may be in the listing.

Properties:

- Config:      no_head
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HTTP_NO_HEAD
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the HTTP backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) and [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)
