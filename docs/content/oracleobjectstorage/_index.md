- [Oracle Object Storage Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Object/Concepts/objectstorageoverview.htm)
- [Oracle Object Storage FAQ](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/storage/object-storage/faq/)

Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsd` command).
You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

Sample command to transfer local artifacts to remote:bucket in oracle object storage:

```sh
rclone -vvv  --progress --stats-one-line --max-stats-groups 10 --log-format date,time,UTC,longfile --fast-list --buffer-size 256Mi --oos-no-check-bucket --oos-upload-cutoff 10Mi --multi-thread-cutoff 16Mi --multi-thread-streams 3000 --transfers 3000 --checkers 64  --retries 2  --oos-chunk-size 10Mi --oos-upload-concurrency 10000  --oos-attempt-resume-upload --oos-leave-parts-on-error sync ./artifacts  remote:bucket -vv
```

## Configuration

Here is an example of making an oracle object storage configuration. `rclone config`
walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

```sh
rclone config
```

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```text
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> n

Enter name for new remote.

## Authentication Providers 

OCI has various authentication methods. To learn more about authentication methods please refer [oci authentication 
methods](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdk_authentication_methods.htm) 
These choices can be specified in the rclone config file.

Rclone supports the following OCI authentication provider.

```text
User Principal
Instance Principal
Resource Principal
Workload Identity
No authentication
```

### User Principal

Sample rclone config file for Authentication Provider User Principal:

```ini
[oos]
type = oracleobjectstorage
namespace = id<redacted>34
compartment = ocid1.compartment.oc1..aa<redacted>ba
region = us-ashburn-1
provider = user_principal_auth
config_file = /home/opc/.oci/config
config_profile = Default
```

Advantages:

- One can use this method from any server within OCI or on-premises or from
  other cloud provider.

Considerations:

- you need to configure user’s privileges / policy to allow access to object
  storage
- Overhead of managing users and keys.
- If the user is deleted, the config file will no longer work and may cause
  automation regressions that use the user's credentials.

### Instance Principal

An OCI compute instance can be authorized to use rclone by using it's identity
and certificates as an instance principal. With this approach no credentials
have to be stored and managed.

Sample rclone configuration file for Authentication Provider Instance Principal:

```sh
[opc@rclone ~]$ cat ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
[oos]
type = oracleobjectstorage
namespace = id<redacted>fn
compartment = ocid1.compartment.oc1..aa<redacted>k7a
region = us-ashburn-1
provider = instance_principal_auth
```

Advantages:

- With instance principals, you don't need to configure user credentials and
  transfer/ save it to disk in your compute instances or rotate the credentials.
- You don’t need to deal with users and keys.
- Greatly helps in automation as you don't have to manage access keys, user
  private keys, storing them in vault, using kms etc.

Considerations:

- You need to configure a dynamic group having this instance as member and add
  policy to read object storage to that dynamic group.
- Everyone who has access to this machine can execute the CLI commands.
- It is applicable for oci compute instances only. It cannot be used on external
  instance or resources.

### Resource Principal

Resource principal auth is very similar to instance principal auth but used for
resources that are not  compute instances such as
[serverless functions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Concepts/functionsoverview.htm).
To use resource principal ensure Rclone process is started with these environment
variables set in its process.

```sh
export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_VERSION=2.2
export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_REGION=us-ashburn-1
export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_PRIVATE_PEM=/usr/share/model-server/key.pem
export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_RPST=/usr/share/model-server/security_token
```

Sample rclone configuration file for Authentication Provider Resource Principal:

```ini
[oos]
type = oracleobjectstorage
namespace = id<redacted>34
compartment = ocid1.compartment.oc1..aa<redacted>ba
region = us-ashburn-1
provider = resource_principal_auth
```

### Workload Identity

Workload Identity auth may be used when running Rclone from Kubernetes pod on
a Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) cluster. For more details on configuring
Workload Identity, see [Granting Workloads Access to OCI Resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contenggrantingworkloadaccesstoresources.htm).
To use workload identity, ensure Rclone is started with these environment
variables set in its process.

```sh
export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_VERSION=2.2
export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_REGION=us-ashburn-1
```

### No authentication

Public buckets do not require any authentication mechanism to read objects.
Sample rclone configuration file for No authentication:

```ini
[oos]
type = oracleobjectstorage
namespace = id<redacted>34
compartment = ocid1.compartment.oc1..aa<redacted>ba
region = us-ashburn-1
provider = no_auth
```

### Modification times and hashes

The modification time is stored as metadata on the object as
`opc-meta-mtime` as floating point since the epoch, accurate to 1 ns.

If the modification time needs to be updated rclone will attempt to perform a server
side copy to update the modification if the object can be copied in a single part.
In the case the object is larger than 5Gb, the object will be uploaded rather than
copied.

Note that reading this from the object takes an additional `HEAD` request as the
metadata isn't returned in object listings.

The MD5 hash algorithm is supported.

### Multipart uploads

rclone supports multipart uploads with OOS which means that it can
upload files bigger than 5 GiB.

Note that files uploaded *both* with multipart upload *and* through
crypt remotes do not have MD5 sums.

rclone switches from single part uploads to multipart uploads at the
point specified by `--oos-upload-cutoff`.  This can be a maximum of 5 GiB
and a minimum of 0 (ie always upload multipart files).

The chunk sizes used in the multipart upload are specified by
`--oos-chunk-size` and the number of chunks uploaded concurrently is
specified by `--oos-upload-concurrency`.

Multipart uploads will use `--transfers` * `--oos-upload-concurrency` *
`--oos-chunk-size` extra memory.  Single part uploads to not use extra
memory.

Single part transfers can be faster than multipart transfers or slower
depending on your latency from oos - the more latency, the more likely
single part transfers will be faster.

Increasing `--oos-upload-concurrency` will increase throughput (8 would
be a sensible value) and increasing `--oos-chunk-size` also increases
throughput (16M would be sensible).  Increasing either of these will
use more memory.  The default values are high enough to gain most of
the possible performance without using too much memory.

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to oracleobjectstorage (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage).

#### --oos-storage-tier

The storage class to use when storing new objects in storage. https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Concepts/understandingstoragetiers.htm

Properties:

- Config:      storage_tier
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_STORAGE_TIER
- Type:        string
- Default:     "Standard"
- Examples:
    - "Standard"
        - Standard storage tier, this is the default tier
    - "InfrequentAccess"
        - InfrequentAccess storage tier
    - "Archive"
        - Archive storage tier

#### --oos-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload.

Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of chunk_size.
The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     200Mi

#### --oos-chunk-size

Chunk size to use for uploading.

When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff or files with unknown
size (e.g. from "rclone rcat" or uploaded with "rclone mount" they will be uploaded 
as multipart uploads using this chunk size.

Note that "upload_concurrency" chunks of this size are buffered
in memory per transfer.

If you are transferring large files over high-speed links and you have
enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.

Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a
large file of known size to stay below the 10,000 chunks limit.

Files of unknown size are uploaded with the configured
chunk_size. Since the default chunk size is 5 MiB and there can be at
most 10,000 chunks, this means that by default the maximum size of
a file you can stream upload is 48 GiB.  If you wish to stream upload
larger files then you will need to increase chunk_size.

Increasing the chunk size decreases the accuracy of the progress
statistics displayed with "-P" flag.


Properties:

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     5Mi

#### --oos-max-upload-parts

Maximum number of parts in a multipart upload.

This option defines the maximum number of multipart chunks to use
when doing a multipart upload.

OCI has max parts limit of 10,000 chunks.

Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a
large file of a known size to stay below this number of chunks limit.


Properties:

- Config:      max_upload_parts
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_MAX_UPLOAD_PARTS
- Type:        int
- Default:     10000

#### --oos-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently.

If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links
and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing
this may help to speed up the transfers.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     10

#### --oos-copy-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to multipart copy.

Any files larger than this that need to be server-side copied will be
copied in chunks of this size.

The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.

Properties:

- Config:      copy_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_COPY_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     4.656Gi

#### --oos-copy-timeout

Timeout for copy.

Copy is an asynchronous operation, specify timeout to wait for copy to succeed


Properties:

- Config:      copy_timeout
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_COPY_TIMEOUT
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --oos-disable-checksum

Don't store MD5 checksum with object metadata.

Normally rclone will calculate the MD5 checksum of the input before
uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great
for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files
to start uploading.

Properties:

- Config:      disable_checksum
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_DISABLE_CHECKSUM
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --oos-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --oos-leave-parts-on-error

If true avoid calling abort upload on a failure, leaving all successfully uploaded parts for manual recovery.

It should be set to true for resuming uploads across different sessions.

WARNING: Storing parts of an incomplete multipart upload counts towards space usage on object storage and will add
additional costs if not cleaned up.


Properties:

- Config:      leave_parts_on_error
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_LEAVE_PARTS_ON_ERROR
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --oos-attempt-resume-upload

If true attempt to resume previously started multipart upload for the object.
This will be helpful to speed up multipart transfers by resuming uploads from past session.

WARNING: If chunk size differs in resumed session from past incomplete session, then the resumed multipart upload is 
aborted and a new multipart upload is started with the new chunk size.

The flag leave_parts_on_error must be true to resume and optimize to skip parts that were already uploaded successfully.


Properties:

- Config:      attempt_resume_upload
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_ATTEMPT_RESUME_UPLOAD
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --oos-no-check-bucket

If set, don't attempt to check the bucket exists or create it.

This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions
rclone does if you know the bucket exists already.

It can also be needed if the user you are using does not have bucket
creation permissions.


Properties:

- Config:      no_check_bucket
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_NO_CHECK_BUCKET
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

Here are the commands specific to the oracleobjectstorage backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the [backend](/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](/rc/#backend-command).

### rename

change the name of an object

    rclone backend rename remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command can be used to rename a object.
