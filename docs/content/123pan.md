### Getting your Client ID and Secret

To use this backend, you need to register as a developer on the
[123Pan Open Platform](https://www.123pan.com/developer) and create an
application to obtain your `client_id` and `client_secret`.

See the [Official Developer Guidelines](https://123yunpan.yuque.com/org-wiki-123yunpan-muaork/cr6ced)
for more information.

### Example Commands

List files from your 123Pan account:

```console
rclone ls 123pan:
```

List all folders:

```console
rclone lsd 123pan:
```

Copy a file to 123Pan:

```console
rclone copy /local/path/file.txt 123pan:/remote/path/
```

Sync files from a local directory to a 123Pan directory:

```console
rclone sync --interactive /local/folder 123pan:/remote/folder/
```

Get storage info about the 123Pan account:

```console
rclone about 123pan:
```

### Modification Times and Hashes

123Pan supports modification times and MD5 hashes, enabling efficient
synchronization with rclone.

### Server-Side Copy

123Pan supports server-side copy using instant upload technology. When copying
files within the same remote, if the file already exists on 123Pan's servers,
it can be copied instantly without re-uploading.

### Rate Limiting

The backend implements per-endpoint rate limiting based on the official 123Pan
API documentation. Different API endpoints have different QPS (queries per
second) limits. The backend handles this automatically.
