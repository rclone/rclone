# {{< icon "fa fa-cloud" >}} 123Pan

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for 123Pan involves getting API credentials from the
[123Pan Developer Console](https://www.123pan.com/developer).

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`. First run:

```console
rclone config
```

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```text
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

Enter name for new remote.
name> remote

Option Storage.
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.
[snip]
XX / 123Pan (123 Cloud Storage)
   \ (123pan)
[snip]
Storage> 123pan

Option client_id.
Client ID from 123pan developer console.
Get it from https://www.123pan.com/developer
Enter a value.
client_id> YOUR_CLIENT_ID

Option client_secret.
Client Secret from 123pan developer console.
Get it from https://www.123pan.com/developer
Enter a value.
client_secret> YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET

Edit advanced config?
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n

Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: 123pan
- client_id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
- client_secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your 123Pan

```console
rclone lsd remote:
```

List all the files in your 123Pan

```console
rclone ls remote:
```

To copy a local directory to a 123Pan directory called backup

```console
rclone copy /home/source remote:backup
```

### Modification times and hashes

123Pan does not support modification times. The modification time
displayed is the time the file was uploaded or last modified on the server.

The MD5 hash algorithm is supported.

### Instant Upload

123Pan supports instant upload (秒传). If you upload a file that already exists
on 123Pan's servers (based on MD5 hash), the upload will complete instantly
without actually transferring the file data.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼          |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：          |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？          |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊          |
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜          |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞          |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

## Limitations

### No modification time support

123Pan does not support setting modification times. The `--update` flag
comparing modification times will not work as expected.

### Empty files not supported

123Pan cannot store empty (0 byte) files. Attempting to upload an empty
file will result in an error.

### Rate limiting

123Pan enforces different API rate limits based on user type:

| API | Free User | VIP User |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| File List | 5 QPS | 10 QPS |
| File Move | 3 QPS | 10 QPS |
| File Delete | 1 QPS | 10 QPS |
| Mkdir | 5 QPS | 20 QPS |
| Download Info | 5 QPS | 10 QPS |
| Upload Create | 2 QPS | 5 QPS |

Rclone automatically detects your VIP status and adjusts rate limiting
accordingly. Due to these limits, operations involving many files may
be slower than expected.

### Share link expiry

When creating share links via `rclone link`, the expiry options are
limited to: 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, or permanent (for requests > 30 days).
