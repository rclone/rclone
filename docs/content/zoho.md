[Zoho WorkDrive](https://www.zoho.com/workdrive/) is a cloud storage solution
created by [Zoho](https://zoho.com).

```sh
rclone config
```

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

 * Say N if running rclone on a (remote) machine without web browser access
If not sure try Y. If Y failed, try N.
y) Yes (default)
n) No

y/e/d> 
```

See the [remote setup docs](/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Rclone runs a webserver on your local computer to collect the
authorization token from Zoho Workdrive. This is only from the moment
your browser is opened until the token is returned.
The webserver runs on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/`.
If local port `53682` is protected by a firewall you may need to temporarily
unblock the firewall to complete authorization.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

See top level directories

```sh
rclone lsd remote:
```

Make a new directory

```sh
rclone mkdir remote:directory
```

List the contents of a directory

```sh
rclone ls remote:directory
```

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote path, deleting any
excess files in the path.

```sh
rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:directory
```

Zoho paths may be as deep as required, eg `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

### Modification times and hashes

Modified times are currently not supported for Zoho Workdrive

No hash algorithms are supported.

### Usage information

To view your current quota you can use the `rclone about remote:`
command which will display your current usage.

### Restricted filename characters

Only control characters and invalid UTF-8 are replaced. In addition most
Unicode full-width characters are not supported at all and will be removed
from filenames during upload.

## Setting up your own client_id

For Zoho we advise you to set up your own client_id. To do so you have to complete the following steps.

1. Log in to the [Zoho API Console](https://api-console.zoho.com)

2. Create a new client of type "Server-based Application". The name and website don't matter, but you must add the redirect URL `http://localhost:53682/`.

3. Once the client is created, you can go to the settings tab and enable it in other regions.

The client id and client secret can now be used with rclone.
