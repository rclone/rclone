# {{< icon "fa fa-server" >}} SFTP

SFTP is the [Secure (or SSH) File Transfer
Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol).

The SFTP backend can be used with a number of different providers:

{{< provider_list >}}
{{< provider name="Hetzner Storage Box" home="https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box" config="/sftp/#hetzner-storage-box">}}
{{< provider name="rsync.net" home="https://rsync.net/products/rclone.html" config="/sftp/#rsync-net">}}
{{< /provider_list >}}

SFTP runs over SSH v2 and is installed as standard with most modern
SSH installations.

Paths are specified as `remote:path`. If the path does not begin with
a `/` it is relative to the home directory of the user.  An empty path
`remote:` refers to the user's home directory. For example, `rclone lsd remote:` 
would list the home directory of the user configured in the rclone remote config 
(`i.e /home/sftpuser`). However, `rclone lsd remote:/` would list the root 
directory for remote machine (i.e. `/`)

Note that some SFTP servers will need the leading / - Synology is a
good example of this. rsync.net and Hetzner, on the other hand, requires users to
OMIT the leading /.

Note that by default rclone will try to execute shell commands on
the server, see [shell access considerations](#shell-access-considerations).

## Configuration

Here is an example of making an SFTP configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / SSH/SFTP
   \ "sftp"
[snip]
Storage> sftp
SSH host to connect to
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Connect to example.com
   \ "example.com"
host> example.com
SSH username
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("$USER").
user> sftpuser
SSH port number
Enter a signed integer. Press Enter for the default (22).
port>
SSH password, leave blank to use ssh-agent.
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No leave this optional password blank
y/g/n> n
Path to unencrypted PEM-encoded private key file, leave blank to use ssh-agent.
key_file>
Remote config
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: sftp
- host: example.com
- user: sftpuser
- port:
- pass:
- key_file:
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this:

See all directories in the home directory

    rclone lsd remote:

See all directories in the root directory

    rclone lsd remote:/

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:path/to/directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:path/to/directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote directory, deleting any
excess files in the directory.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:directory

Mount the remote path `/srv/www-data/` to the local path
`/mnt/www-data`

    rclone mount remote:/srv/www-data/ /mnt/www-data

### SSH Authentication

The SFTP remote supports three authentication methods:

  * Password
  * Key file, including certificate signed keys
  * ssh-agent

Key files should be PEM-encoded private key files. For instance `/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa`.
Only unencrypted OpenSSH or PEM encrypted files are supported.

The key file can be specified in either an external file (key_file) or contained within the 
rclone config file (key_pem).  If using key_pem in the config file, the entry should be on a
single line with new line ('\n' or '\r\n') separating lines.  i.e.

    key_pem = -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMaMbaIXtE\n0gAMbMbaSsd\nMbaass\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

This will generate it correctly for key_pem for use in the config:

    awk '{printf "%s\\n", $0}' < ~/.ssh/id_rsa

If you don't specify `pass`, `key_file`, or `key_pem` or `ask_password` then
rclone will attempt to contact an ssh-agent. You can also specify `key_use_agent`
to force the usage of an ssh-agent. In this case `key_file` or `key_pem` can
also be specified to force the usage of a specific key in the ssh-agent.

Using an ssh-agent is the only way to load encrypted OpenSSH keys at the moment.

If you set the `ask_password` option, rclone will prompt for a password when
needed and no password has been configured.

#### Certificate-signed keys

With traditional key-based authentication, you configure your private key only,
and the public key built into it will be used during the authentication process.

If you have a certificate you may use it to sign your public key, creating a
separate SSH user certificate that should be used instead of the plain public key
extracted from the private key. Then you must provide the path to the
user certificate public key file in `pubkey_file` or the content of the file in `pubkey`.

Note: This is not the traditional public key paired with your private key,
typically saved as `/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. Setting this path in
`pubkey_file` will not work.

Example:

```
[remote]
type = sftp
host = example.com
user = sftpuser
key_file = ~/id_rsa
pubkey_file = ~/id_rsa-cert.pub
````

If you concatenate a cert with a private key then you can specify the
merged file in both places.

Note: the cert must come first in the file.  e.g.

```
cat id_rsa-cert.pub id_rsa > merged_key
```

### Host key validation

By default rclone will not check the server's host key for validation.  This
can allow an attacker to replace a server with their own and if you use
password authentication then this can lead to that password being exposed.

Host key matching, using standard `known_hosts` files can be turned on by
enabling the `known_hosts_file` option.  This can point to the file maintained
by `OpenSSH` or can point to a unique file.

e.g. using the OpenSSH `known_hosts` file:

```
[remote]
type = sftp
host = example.com
user = sftpuser
pass = 
known_hosts_file = ~/.ssh/known_hosts
````

Alternatively you can create your own known hosts file like this:

```
ssh-keyscan -t dsa,rsa,ecdsa,ed25519 example.com >> known_hosts
```

There are some limitations:

* `rclone` will not _manage_ this file for you.  If the key is missing or
wrong then the connection will be refused.
* If the server is set up for a certificate host key then the entry in
the `known_hosts` file _must_ be the `@cert-authority` entry for the CA

If the host key provided by the server does not match the one in the
file (or is missing) then the connection will be aborted and an error
returned such as

    NewFs: couldn't connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: knownhosts: key mismatch

or

    NewFs: couldn't connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: knownhosts: key is unknown

If you see an error such as

    NewFs: couldn't connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: ssh: no authorities for hostname: example.com:22

then it is likely the server has presented a CA signed host certificate
and you will need to add the appropriate `@cert-authority` entry.

The `known_hosts_file` setting can be set during `rclone config` as an
advanced option.

### ssh-agent on macOS

Note that there seem to be various problems with using an ssh-agent on
macOS due to recent changes in the OS.  The most effective work-around
seems to be to start an ssh-agent in each session, e.g.

    eval `ssh-agent -s` && ssh-add -A

And then at the end of the session

    eval `ssh-agent -k`

These commands can be used in scripts of course.

### Shell access

Some functionality of the SFTP backend relies on remote shell access,
and the possibility to execute commands. This includes [checksum](#checksum),
and in some cases also [about](#about-command). The shell commands that
must be executed may be different on different type of shells, and also
quoting/escaping of file path arguments containing special characters may
be different. Rclone therefore needs to know what type of shell it is,
and if shell access is available at all.

Most servers run on some version of Unix, and then a basic Unix shell can
be assumed, without further distinction. Windows 10, Server 2019, and later
can also run a SSH server, which is a port of OpenSSH (see official
[installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)). On a Windows server the shell handling is different: Although it can also
be set up to use a Unix type shell, e.g. Cygwin bash, the default is to
use Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe), and PowerShell is a recommended
alternative. All of these have behave differently, which rclone must handle.

Rclone tries to auto-detect what type of shell is used on the server,
first time you access the SFTP remote. If a remote shell session is
successfully created, it will look for indications that it is CMD or
PowerShell, with fall-back to Unix if not something else is detected.
If unable to even create a remote shell session, then shell command
execution will be disabled entirely. The result is stored in the SFTP
remote configuration, in option `shell_type`, so that the auto-detection
only have to be performed once. If you manually set a value for this
option before first run, the auto-detection will be skipped, and if
you set a different value later this will override any existing.
Value `none` can be set to avoid any attempts at executing shell
commands, e.g. if this is not allowed on the server.
If you have `shell_type = none` in the configuration then
the [ssh](#sftp-ssh) must not be set.

When the server is [rclone serve sftp](/commands/rclone_serve_sftp/),
the rclone SFTP remote will detect this as a Unix type shell - even
if it is running on Windows. This server does not actually have a shell,
but it accepts input commands matching the specific ones that the
SFTP backend relies on for Unix shells, e.g. `md5sum` and `df`. Also
it handles the string escape rules used for Unix shell. Treating it
as a Unix type shell from a SFTP remote will therefore always be
correct, and support all features.

#### Shell access considerations

The shell type auto-detection logic, described above, means that
by default rclone will try to run a shell command the first time
a new sftp remote is accessed. If you configure a sftp remote
without a config file, e.g. an [on the fly](/docs/#backend-path-to-dir])
remote, rclone will have nowhere to store the result, and it
will re-run the command on every access. To avoid this you should
explicitly set the `shell_type` option to the correct value,
or to `none` if you want to prevent rclone from executing any
remote shell commands.

It is also important to note that, since the shell type decides
how quoting and escaping of file paths used as command-line arguments
are performed, configuring the wrong shell type may leave you exposed
to command injection exploits. Make sure to confirm the auto-detected
shell type, or explicitly set the shell type you know is correct,
or disable shell access until you know.

### Checksum

SFTP does not natively support checksums (file hash), but rclone
is able to use checksumming if the same login has shell access,
and can execute remote commands. If there is a command that can
calculate compatible checksums on the remote system, Rclone can
then be configured to execute this whenever a checksum is needed,
and read back the results. Currently MD5 and SHA-1 are supported.

Normally this requires an external utility being available on
the server. By default rclone will try commands `md5sum`, `md5`
and `rclone md5sum` for MD5 checksums, and the first one found usable
will be picked. Same with `sha1sum`, `sha1` and `rclone sha1sum`
commands for SHA-1 checksums. These utilities normally need to
be in the remote's PATH to be found.

In some cases the shell itself is capable of calculating checksums.
PowerShell is an example of such a shell. If rclone detects that the
remote shell is PowerShell, which means it most probably is a
Windows OpenSSH server, rclone will use a predefined script block
to produce the checksums when no external checksum commands are found
(see [shell access](#shell-access)). This assumes PowerShell version
4.0 or newer.

The options `md5sum_command` and `sha1_command` can be used to customize
the command to be executed for calculation of checksums. You can for
example set a specific path to where md5sum and sha1sum executables
are located, or use them to specify some other tools that print checksums
in compatible format. The value can include command-line arguments,
or even shell script blocks as with PowerShell. Rclone has subcommands
[md5sum](/commands/rclone_md5sum/) and [sha1sum](/commands/rclone_sha1sum/)
that use compatible format, which means if you have an rclone executable
on the server it can be used. As mentioned above, they will be automatically
picked up if found in PATH, but if not you can set something like
`/path/to/rclone md5sum` as the value of option `md5sum_command` to
make sure a specific executable is used.

Remote checksumming is recommended and enabled by default. First time
rclone is using a SFTP remote, if options `md5sum_command` or `sha1_command`
are not set, it will check if any of the default commands for each of them,
as described above, can be used. The result will be saved in the remote
configuration, so next time it will use the same. Value `none`
will be set if none of the default commands could be used for a specific
algorithm, and this algorithm will not be supported by the remote.

Disabling the checksumming may be required if you are connecting to SFTP servers
which are not under your control, and to which the execution of remote shell
commands is prohibited.  Set the configuration option `disable_hashcheck`
to `true` to disable checksumming entirely, or set `shell_type` to `none`
to disable all functionality based on remote shell command execution.

### Modification times and hashes

Modified times are stored on the server to 1 second precision.

Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported.

Some SFTP servers disable setting/modifying the file modification time after
upload (for example, certain configurations of ProFTPd with mod_sftp). If you
are using one of these servers, you can set the option `set_modtime = false` in
your RClone backend configuration to disable this behaviour.

### About command

The `about` command returns the total space, free space, and used
space on the remote for the disk of the specified path on the remote or,
if not set, the disk of the root on the remote.

SFTP usually supports the [about](/commands/rclone_about/) command, but
it depends on the server. If the server implements the vendor-specific
VFS statistics extension, which is normally the case with OpenSSH instances,
it will be used. If not, but the same login has access to a Unix shell,
where the `df` command is available (e.g. in the remote's PATH), then
this will be used instead. If the server shell is PowerShell, probably
with a Windows OpenSSH server, rclone will use a built-in shell command
(see [shell access](#shell-access)). If none of the above is applicable,
`about` will fail.

- Required:    true

#### --sftp-user

SSH username.

Properties:

- Config:      user
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_USER
- Type:        string
- Default:     "$USER"

#### --sftp-port

SSH port number.

Properties:

- Config:      port
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_PORT
- Type:        int
- Default:     22

#### --sftp-pass

SSH password, leave blank to use ssh-agent.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](/commands/rclone_obscure/).

Properties:

- Config:      pass
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_PASS
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-key-pem

Raw PEM-encoded private key.

Note that this should be on a single line with line endings replaced with '\n', eg

    key_pem = -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMaMbaIXtE\n0gAMbMbaSsd\nMbaass\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

This will generate the single line correctly:

    awk '{printf "%s\\n", $0}' < ~/.ssh/id_rsa

If specified, it will override the key_file parameter.

Properties:

- Config:      key_pem
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_PEM
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-key-file

Path to PEM-encoded private key file.

Leave blank or set key-use-agent to use ssh-agent.

Leading `~` will be expanded in the file name as will environment variables such as `${RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR}`.

Properties:

- Config:      key_file
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_FILE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-key-file-pass

The passphrase to decrypt the PEM-encoded private key file.

Only PEM encrypted key files (old OpenSSH format) are supported. Encrypted keys
in the new OpenSSH format can't be used.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](/commands/rclone_obscure/).

Properties:

- Config:      key_file_pass
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_FILE_PASS
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-pubkey

SSH public certificate for public certificate based authentication.
Set this if you have a signed certificate you want to use for authentication.
If specified will override pubkey_file.

Properties:

- Config:      pubkey
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_PUBKEY
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-pubkey-file

Optional path to public key file.

Set this if you have a signed certificate you want to use for authentication.

Leading `~` will be expanded in the file name as will environment variables such as `${RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR}`.

Properties:

- Config:      pubkey_file
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_PUBKEY_FILE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-key-use-agent

When set forces the usage of the ssh-agent.

When key-file is also set, the ".pub" file of the specified key-file is read and only the associated key is
requested from the ssh-agent. This allows to avoid `Too many authentication failures for *username*` errors
when the ssh-agent contains many keys.

Properties:

- Config:      key_use_agent
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_USE_AGENT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-use-insecure-cipher

Enable the use of insecure ciphers and key exchange methods.

This enables the use of the following insecure ciphers and key exchange methods:

- aes128-cbc
- aes192-cbc
- aes256-cbc
- 3des-cbc
- diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256
- diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1

Those algorithms are insecure and may allow plaintext data to be recovered by an attacker.

This must be false if you use either ciphers or key_exchange advanced options.


Properties:

- Config:      use_insecure_cipher
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_USE_INSECURE_CIPHER
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false
- Examples:
    - "false"
        - Use default Cipher list.
    - "true"
        - Enables the use of the aes128-cbc cipher and diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256, diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 key exchange.

#### --sftp-disable-hashcheck

Disable the execution of SSH commands to determine if remote file hashing is available.

Leave blank or set to false to enable hashing (recommended), set to true to disable hashing.

Properties:

- Config:      disable_hashcheck
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_DISABLE_HASHCHECK
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-ssh

Path and arguments to external ssh binary.

Normally rclone will use its internal ssh library to connect to the
SFTP server. However it does not implement all possible ssh options so
it may be desirable to use an external ssh binary.

Rclone ignores all the internal config if you use this option and
expects you to configure the ssh binary with the user/host/port and
any other options you need.

**Important** The ssh command must log in without asking for a
password so needs to be configured with keys or certificates.

Rclone will run the command supplied either with the additional
arguments "-s sftp" to access the SFTP subsystem or with commands such
as "md5sum /path/to/file" appended to read checksums.

Any arguments with spaces in should be surrounded by "double quotes".

An example setting might be:

    ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=20 user@example.com

Note that when using an external ssh binary rclone makes a new ssh
connection for every hash it calculates.


Properties:

- Config:      ssh
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SSH
- Type:        SpaceSepList
- Default:     

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to sftp (SSH/SFTP).

#### --sftp-known-hosts-file

Optional path to known_hosts file.

Set this value to enable server host key validation.

Leading `~` will be expanded in the file name as will environment variables such as `${RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR}`.

Properties:

- Config:      known_hosts_file
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false
- Examples:
    - "~/.ssh/known_hosts"
        - Use OpenSSH's known_hosts file.

#### --sftp-ask-password

Allow asking for SFTP password when needed.

If this is set and no password is supplied then rclone will:
- ask for a password
- not contact the ssh agent


Properties:

- Config:      ask_password
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_ASK_PASSWORD
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-path-override

Override path used by SSH shell commands.

This allows checksum calculation when SFTP and SSH paths are
different. This issue affects among others Synology NAS boxes.

E.g. if shared folders can be found in directories representing volumes:

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/directory --sftp-path-override /volume2/directory

E.g. if home directory can be found in a shared folder called "home":

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/home/directory --sftp-path-override /volume1/homes/USER/directory
	
To specify only the path to the SFTP remote's root, and allow rclone to add any relative subpaths automatically (including unwrapping/decrypting remotes as necessary), add the '@' character to the beginning of the path.

E.g. the first example above could be rewritten as:

	rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/directory --sftp-path-override @/volume2
	
Note that when using this method with Synology "home" folders, the full "/homes/USER" path should be specified instead of "/home".

E.g. the second example above should be rewritten as:

	rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/homes/USER/directory --sftp-path-override @/volume1

Properties:

- Config:      path_override
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_PATH_OVERRIDE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-set-modtime

Set the modified time on the remote if set.

Properties:

- Config:      set_modtime
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SET_MODTIME
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --sftp-shell-type

The type of SSH shell on remote server, if any.

Leave blank for autodetect.

Properties:

- Config:      shell_type
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SHELL_TYPE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false
- Examples:
    - "none"
        - No shell access
    - "unix"
        - Unix shell
    - "powershell"
        - PowerShell
    - "cmd"
        - Windows Command Prompt

#### --sftp-md5sum-command

The command used to read md5 hashes.

Leave blank for autodetect.

Properties:

- Config:      md5sum_command
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_MD5SUM_COMMAND
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-sha1sum-command

The command used to read sha1 hashes.

Leave blank for autodetect.

Properties:

- Config:      sha1sum_command
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SHA1SUM_COMMAND
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-skip-links

Set to skip any symlinks and any other non regular files.

Properties:

- Config:      skip_links
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SKIP_LINKS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-subsystem

Specifies the SSH2 subsystem on the remote host.

Properties:

- Config:      subsystem
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SUBSYSTEM
- Type:        string
- Default:     "sftp"

#### --sftp-server-command

Specifies the path or command to run a sftp server on the remote host.

The subsystem option is ignored when server_command is defined.

If adding server_command to the configuration file please note that 
it should not be enclosed in quotes, since that will make rclone fail.

A working example is:

    [remote_name]
    type = sftp
    server_command = sudo /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server

Properties:

- Config:      server_command
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SERVER_COMMAND
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-use-fstat

If set use fstat instead of stat.

Some servers limit the amount of open files and calling Stat after opening
the file will throw an error from the server. Setting this flag will call
Fstat instead of Stat which is called on an already open file handle.

It has been found that this helps with IBM Sterling SFTP servers which have
"extractability" level set to 1 which means only 1 file can be opened at
any given time.


Properties:

- Config:      use_fstat
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_USE_FSTAT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-disable-concurrent-reads

If set don't use concurrent reads.

Normally concurrent reads are safe to use and not using them will
degrade performance, so this option is disabled by default.

Some servers limit the amount number of times a file can be
downloaded. Using concurrent reads can trigger this limit, so if you
have a server which returns

    Failed to copy: file does not exist

Then you may need to enable this flag.

If concurrent reads are disabled, the use_fstat option is ignored.


Properties:

- Config:      disable_concurrent_reads
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_DISABLE_CONCURRENT_READS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-disable-concurrent-writes

If set don't use concurrent writes.

Normally rclone uses concurrent writes to upload files. This improves
the performance greatly, especially for distant servers.

This option disables concurrent writes should that be necessary.


Properties:

- Config:      disable_concurrent_writes
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_DISABLE_CONCURRENT_WRITES
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-idle-timeout

Max time before closing idle connections.

If no connections have been returned to the connection pool in the time
given, rclone will empty the connection pool.

Set to 0 to keep connections indefinitely.


Properties:

- Config:      idle_timeout
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_IDLE_TIMEOUT
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --sftp-chunk-size

Upload and download chunk size.

This controls the maximum size of payload in SFTP protocol packets.
The RFC limits this to 32768 bytes (32k), which is the default. However,
a lot of servers support larger sizes, typically limited to a maximum
total package size of 256k, and setting it larger will increase transfer
speed dramatically on high latency links. This includes OpenSSH, and,
for example, using the value of 255k works well, leaving plenty of room
for overhead while still being within a total packet size of 256k.

Make sure to test thoroughly before using a value higher than 32k,
and only use it if you always connect to the same server or after
sufficiently broad testing. If you get errors such as
"failed to send packet payload: EOF", lots of "connection lost",
or "corrupted on transfer", when copying a larger file, try lowering
the value. The server run by [rclone serve sftp](/commands/rclone_serve_sftp)
sends packets with standard 32k maximum payload so you must not
set a different chunk_size when downloading files, but it accepts
packets up to the 256k total size, so for uploads the chunk_size
can be set as for the OpenSSH example above.


Properties:

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     32Ki

#### --sftp-concurrency

The maximum number of outstanding requests for one file

This controls the maximum number of outstanding requests for one file.
Increasing it will increase throughput on high latency links at the
cost of using more memory.


Properties:

- Config:      concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     64

#### --sftp-connections

Maximum number of SFTP simultaneous connections, 0 for unlimited.

Note that setting this is very likely to cause deadlocks so it should
be used with care.

If you are doing a sync or copy then make sure connections is one more
than the sum of `--transfers` and `--checkers`.

If you use `--check-first` then it just needs to be one more than the
maximum of `--checkers` and `--transfers`.

So for `connections 3` you'd use `--checkers 2 --transfers 2
--check-first` or `--checkers 1 --transfers 1`.



Properties:

- Config:      connections
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_CONNECTIONS
- Type:        int
- Default:     0

#### --sftp-set-env

Environment variables to pass to sftp and commands

Set environment variables in the form:

    VAR=value

to be passed to the sftp client and to any commands run (eg md5sum).

Pass multiple variables space separated, eg

    VAR1=value VAR2=value

and pass variables with spaces in quotes, eg

    "VAR3=value with space" "VAR4=value with space" VAR5=nospacehere



Properties:

- Config:      set_env
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SET_ENV
- Type:        SpaceSepList
- Default:     

#### --sftp-ciphers

Space separated list of ciphers to be used for session encryption, ordered by preference.

At least one must match with server configuration. This can be checked for example using ssh -Q cipher.

This must not be set if use_insecure_cipher is true.

Example:

    aes128-ctr aes192-ctr aes256-ctr aes128-gcm@openssh.com aes256-gcm@openssh.com


Properties:

- Config:      ciphers
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_CIPHERS
- Type:        SpaceSepList
- Default:     

#### --sftp-key-exchange

Space separated list of key exchange algorithms, ordered by preference.

At least one must match with server configuration. This can be checked for example using ssh -Q kex.

This must not be set if use_insecure_cipher is true.

Example:

    sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com curve25519-sha256 curve25519-sha256@libssh.org ecdh-sha2-nistp256


Properties:

- Config:      key_exchange
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_EXCHANGE
- Type:        SpaceSepList
- Default:     

#### --sftp-macs

Space separated list of MACs (message authentication code) algorithms, ordered by preference.

At least one must match with server configuration. This can be checked for example using ssh -Q mac.

Example:

    umac-64-etm@openssh.com umac-128-etm@openssh.com hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com


Properties:

- Config:      macs
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_MACS
- Type:        SpaceSepList
- Default:     

#### --sftp-host-key-algorithms

Space separated list of host key algorithms, ordered by preference.

At least one must match with server configuration. This can be checked for example using ssh -Q HostKeyAlgorithms.

Note: This can affect the outcome of key negotiation with the server even if server host key validation is not enabled.

Example:

    ssh-ed25519 ssh-rsa ssh-dss


Properties:

- Config:      host_key_algorithms
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_HOST_KEY_ALGORITHMS
- Type:        SpaceSepList
- Default:     

#### --sftp-socks-proxy

Socks 5 proxy host.
	
Supports the format user:pass@host:port, user@host:port, host:port.

Example:

	myUser:myPass@localhost:9005
	

Properties:

- Config:      socks_proxy
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SOCKS_PROXY
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-http-proxy

URL for HTTP CONNECT proxy

Set this to a URL for an HTTP proxy which supports the HTTP CONNECT verb.


Properties:

- Config:      http_proxy
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_HTTP_PROXY
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-copy-is-hardlink

Set to enable server side copies using hardlinks.

The SFTP protocol does not define a copy command so normally server
side copies are not allowed with the sftp backend.

However the SFTP protocol does support hardlinking, and if you enable
this flag then the sftp backend will support server side copies. These
will be implemented by doing a hardlink from the source to the
destination.

Not all sftp servers support this.

Note that hardlinking two files together will use no additional space
as the source and the destination will be the same file.

This feature may be useful backups made with --copy-dest.

Properties:

- Config:      copy_is_hardlink
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_COPY_IS_HARDLINK
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

{{< rem autogenerated options stop >}}

## Limitations

On some SFTP servers (e.g. Synology) the paths are different
for SSH and SFTP so the hashes can't be calculated properly.
You can either use [`--sftp-path-override`](#--sftp-path-override)
or [`disable_hashcheck`](#--sftp-disable-hashcheck).

The only ssh agent supported under Windows is Putty's pageant.

The Go SSH library disables the use of the aes128-cbc cipher by
default, due to security concerns. This can be re-enabled on a
per-connection basis by setting the `use_insecure_cipher` setting in
the configuration file to `true`. Further details on the insecurity of
this cipher can be found
[in this paper](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/SandPfinal.pdf).

SFTP isn't supported under plan9 until [this
issue](https://github.com/pkg/sftp/issues/156) is fixed.

Note that since SFTP isn't HTTP based the following flags don't work
with it: `--dump-headers`, `--dump-bodies`, `--dump-auth`.

Note that `--timeout` and `--contimeout` are both supported.

## rsync.net {#rsync-net}

rsync.net is supported through the SFTP backend.

See [rsync.net's documentation of rclone examples](https://www.rsync.net/products/rclone.html).

## Hetzner Storage Box {#hetzner-storage-box}

Hetzner Storage Boxes are supported through the SFTP backend on port 23.

See [Hetzner's documentation for details](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/storage-box/access/access-ssh-rsync-borg#rclone)
