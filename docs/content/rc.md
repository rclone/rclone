# Remote controlling rclone with its API

If rclone is run with the `--rc` flag then it starts an HTTP server
which can be used to remote control rclone using its API.

You can either use the [rc](#api-rc) command to access the API
or [use HTTP directly](#api-http).

If you just want to run a remote control then see the [rcd](/commands/rclone_rcd/) command.

## Supported parameters

### --rc

Flag to start the http server listen on remote requests.
      
### --rc-addr=IP

IPaddress:Port or :Port to bind server to. (default "localhost:5572").

### --rc-cert=KEY

SSL PEM key (concatenation of certificate and CA certificate).

### --rc-client-ca=PATH

Client certificate authority to verify clients with.

### --rc-htpasswd=PATH

htpasswd file - if not provided no authentication is done.

### --rc-key=PATH

TLS PEM private key file.

### --rc-max-header-bytes=VALUE

Maximum size of request header (default 4096).

### --rc-min-tls-version=VALUE

The minimum TLS version that is acceptable. Valid values are "tls1.0",
"tls1.1", "tls1.2" and "tls1.3" (default "tls1.0").

### --rc-user=VALUE

User name for authentication.

### --rc-pass=VALUE

Password for authentication.

### --rc-realm=VALUE

Realm for authentication (default "rclone").

### --rc-server-read-timeout=DURATION

Timeout for server reading data (default 1h0m0s).

### --rc-server-write-timeout=DURATION

Timeout for server writing data (default 1h0m0s).

### --rc-serve

Enable the serving of remote objects via the HTTP interface.  This
means objects will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5572/ by default,
so you can browse to http://127.0.0.1:5572/ or http://127.0.0.1:5572/*
to see a listing of the remotes.  Objects may be requested from
remotes using this syntax http://127.0.0.1:5572/[remote:path]/path/to/object

Default Off.

### --rc-serve-no-modtime

Set this flag to skip reading the modification time (can speed things up).

Default Off.

### --rc-files /path/to/directory

Path to local files to serve on the HTTP server.

If this is set then rclone will serve the files in that directory.  It
will also open the root in the web browser if specified.  This is for
implementing browser based GUIs for rclone functions.

If `--rc-user` or `--rc-pass` is set then the URL that is opened will
have the authorization in the URL in the `http://user:pass@localhost/`
style.

Default Off.

### --rc-enable-metrics

Enable OpenMetrics/Prometheus compatible endpoint at `/metrics`.
If more control over the metrics is desired (for example running it on a different port or with different auth) then endpoint can be enabled with the `--metrics-*` flags instead.

Default Off.

### --rc-web-gui

Set this flag to serve the default web gui on the same port as rclone.

Default Off.

### --rc-allow-origin

Set the allowed Access-Control-Allow-Origin for rc requests.

Can be used with --rc-web-gui if the rclone is running on different IP than the web-gui.

Default is IP address on which rc is running.

### --rc-web-fetch-url

Set the URL to fetch the rclone-web-gui files from.

Default https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone-webui-react/releases/latest.

### --rc-web-gui-update

Set this flag to check and update rclone-webui-react from the rc-web-fetch-url.

Default Off.

### --rc-web-gui-force-update

Set this flag to force update rclone-webui-react from the rc-web-fetch-url.

Default Off.

### --rc-web-gui-no-open-browser

Set this flag to disable opening browser automatically when using web-gui.

Default Off.

### --rc-job-expire-duration=DURATION

Expire finished async jobs older than DURATION (default 60s).

### --rc-job-expire-interval=DURATION

Interval duration to check for expired async jobs (default 10s).

### --rc-no-auth

By default rclone will require authorisation to have been set up on
the rc interface in order to use any methods which access any rclone
remotes.  Eg `operations/list` is denied as it involved creating a
remote as is `sync/copy`.

If this is set then no authorisation will be required on the server to
use these methods.  The alternative is to use `--rc-user` and
`--rc-pass` and use these credentials in the request.

Default Off.

### --rc-baseurl

Prefix for URLs.

Default is root

### --rc-template

User-specified template.

## Accessing the remote control via the rclone rc command {#api-rc}

Rclone itself implements the remote control protocol in its `rclone
rc` command.

You can use it like this:

```
$ rclone rc rc/noop param1=one param2=two
{
	"param1": "one",
	"param2": "two"
}
```

If the remote is running on a different URL than the default
`http://localhost:5572/`, use the `--url` option to specify it:

```
$ rclone rc --url http://some.remote:1234/ rc/noop
```

Or, if the remote is listening on a Unix socket, use the `--unix-socket` option
instead:

```
$ rclone rc --unix-socket /tmp/rclone.sock rc/noop
```

Run `rclone rc` on its own, without any commands, to see the help for the
installed remote control commands. Note that this also needs to connect to the
remote server.

## JSON input

`rclone rc` also supports a `--json` flag which can be used to send
more complicated input parameters.

```
$ rclone rc --json '{ "p1": [1,"2",null,4], "p2": { "a":1, "b":2 } }' rc/noop
{
	"p1": [
		1,
		"2",
		null,
		4
	],
	"p2": {
		"a": 1,
		"b": 2
	}
}
```

If the parameter being passed is an object then it can be passed as a
JSON string rather than using the `--json` flag which simplifies the
command line.

```
rclone rc operations/list fs=/tmp remote=test opt='{"showHash": true}'
```

Rather than

```
rclone rc operations/list --json '{"fs": "/tmp", "remote": "test", "opt": {"showHash": true}}'
```

## Special parameters

The rc interface supports some special parameters which apply to
**all** commands.  These start with `_` to show they are different.

### Running asynchronous jobs with _async = true

Each rc call is classified as a job and it is assigned its own id. By default
jobs are executed immediately as they are created or synchronously.

If `_async` has a true value when supplied to an rc call then it will
return immediately with a job id and the task will be run in the
background.  The `job/status` call can be used to get information of
the background job.  The job can be queried for up to 1 minute after
it has finished.

It is recommended that potentially long running jobs, e.g. `sync/sync`,
`sync/copy`, `sync/move`, `operations/purge` are run with the `_async`
flag to avoid any potential problems with the HTTP request and
response timing out.

Starting a job with the `_async` flag:

```
$ rclone rc --json '{ "p1": [1,"2",null,4], "p2": { "a":1, "b":2 }, "_async": true }' rc/noop
{
	"jobid": 2
}
```

Query the status to see if the job has finished.  For more information
on the meaning of these return parameters see the `job/status` call.

```
$ rclone rc --json '{ "jobid":2 }' job/status
{
	"duration": 0.000124163,
	"endTime": "2018-10-27T11:38:07.911245881+01:00",
	"error": "",
	"finished": true,
	"id": 2,
	"output": {
		"_async": true,
		"p1": [
			1,
			"2",
			null,
			4
		],
		"p2": {
			"a": 1,
			"b": 2
		}
	},
	"startTime": "2018-10-27T11:38:07.911121728+01:00",
	"success": true
}
```

`job/list` can be used to show the running or recently completed jobs

```
$ rclone rc job/list
{
	"jobids": [
		2
	]
}
```

### Setting config flags with _config

If you wish to set config (the equivalent of the global flags) for the
duration of an rc call only then pass in the `_config` parameter.

This should be in the same format as the `config` key returned by
[options/get](#options-get).

For example, if you wished to run a sync with the `--checksum`
parameter, you would pass this parameter in your JSON blob.

    "_config":{"CheckSum": true}

If using `rclone rc` this could be passed as

    rclone rc sync/sync ... _config='{"CheckSum": true}'

Any config parameters you don't set will inherit the global defaults
which were set with command line flags or environment variables.

Note that it is possible to set some values as strings or integers -
see [data types](#data-types) for more info. Here is an example
setting the equivalent of `--buffer-size` in string or integer format.

    "_config":{"BufferSize": "42M"}
    "_config":{"BufferSize": 44040192}

If you wish to check the `_config` assignment has worked properly then
calling `options/local` will show what the value got set to.

### Setting filter flags with _filter

If you wish to set filters for the duration of an rc call only then
pass in the `_filter` parameter.

This should be in the same format as the `filter` key returned by
[options/get](#options-get).

For example, if you wished to run a sync with these flags

    --max-size 1M --max-age 42s --include "a" --include "b"

you would pass this parameter in your JSON blob.

    "_filter":{"MaxSize":"1M", "IncludeRule":["a","b"], "MaxAge":"42s"}

If using `rclone rc` this could be passed as

    rclone rc ... _filter='{"MaxSize":"1M", "IncludeRule":["a","b"], "MaxAge":"42s"}'

Any filter parameters you don't set will inherit the global defaults
which were set with command line flags or environment variables.

Note that it is possible to set some values as strings or integers -
see [data types](#data-types) for more info. Here is an example
setting the equivalent of `--buffer-size` in string or integer format.

    "_filter":{"MinSize": "42M"}
    "_filter":{"MinSize": 44040192}

If you wish to check the `_filter` assignment has worked properly then
calling `options/local` will show what the value got set to.

### Assigning operations to groups with _group = value

Each rc call has its own stats group for tracking its metrics. By default
grouping is done by the composite group name from prefix `job/` and  id of the
job like so `job/1`.

If `_group` has a value then stats for that request will be grouped under that
value. This allows caller to group stats under their own name.

Stats for specific group can be accessed by passing `group` to `core/stats`:

```
$ rclone rc --json '{ "group": "job/1" }' core/stats
{
	"speed": 12345
	...
}
```

## Data types {#data-types}

When the API returns types, these will mostly be straight forward
integer, string or boolean types.

However some of the types returned by the [options/get](#options-get)
call and taken by the [options/set](#options-set) calls as well as the
`vfsOpt`, `mountOpt` and the `_config` parameters.

- `Duration` - these are returned as an integer duration in
  nanoseconds. They may be set as an integer, or they may be set with
  time string, eg "5s". See the [options section](/docs/#options) for
  more info.
- `Size` - these are returned as an integer number of bytes. They may
  be set as an integer or they may be set with a size suffix string,
  eg "10M". See the [options section](/docs/#options) for more info.
- Enumerated type (such as `CutoffMode`, `DumpFlags`, `LogLevel`,
  `VfsCacheMode` - these will be returned as an integer and may be set
  as an integer but more conveniently they can be set as a string, eg
  "HARD" for `CutoffMode` or `DEBUG` for `LogLevel`.
- `BandwidthSpec` - this will be set and returned as a string, eg
  "1M".

### Option blocks {#option-blocks}

The calls [options/info](#options-info) (for the main config) and
[config/providers](#config-providers) (for the backend config) may be
used to get information on the rclone configuration options. This can
be used to build user interfaces for displaying and setting any rclone
option.

These consist of arrays of `Option` blocks. These have the following
format. Each block describes a single option.

| Field | Type | Optional | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| Name       | string     | N | name of the option in snake_case |
| FieldName  | string     | N | name of the field used in the rc - if blank use Name. May contain "." for nested fields. |
| Help       | string     | N | help, started with a single sentence on a single line |
| Groups     | string     | Y | groups this option belongs to - comma separated string for options classification |
| Provider   | string     | Y | set to filter on provider |
| Default    | any        | N | default value, if set (and not to nil or "") then Required does nothing |
| Value      | any        | N | value to be set by flags |
| Examples   | Examples   | Y | predefined values that can be selected from list (multiple-choice option) |
| ShortOpt   | string     | Y | the short command line option for this |
| Hide       | Visibility | N | if non zero, this option is hidden from the configurator or the command line |
| Required   | bool       | N | this option is required, meaning value cannot be empty unless there is a default |
| IsPassword | bool       | N | set if the option is a password |
| NoPrefix   | bool       | N | set if the option for this should not use the backend prefix |
| Advanced   | bool       | N | set if this is an advanced config option |
| Exclusive  | bool       | N | set if the answer can only be one of the examples (empty string allowed unless Required or Default is set) |
| Sensitive  | bool       | N | set if this option should be redacted when using `rclone config redacted` |

An example of this might be the `--log-level` flag. Note that the
`Name` of the option becomes the command line flag with `_` replaced
with `-`.

```
{
    "Advanced": false,
    "Default": 5,
    "DefaultStr": "NOTICE",
    "Examples": [
        {
            "Help": "",
            "Value": "EMERGENCY"
        },
        {
            "Help": "",
            "Value": "ALERT"
        },
        ...
    ],
    "Exclusive": true,
    "FieldName": "LogLevel",
    "Groups": "Logging",
    "Help": "Log level DEBUG|INFO|NOTICE|ERROR",
    "Hide": 0,
    "IsPassword": false,
    "Name": "log_level",
    "NoPrefix": true,
    "Required": true,
    "Sensitive": false,
    "Type": "LogLevel",
    "Value": null,
    "ValueStr": "NOTICE"
},
```

Note that the `Help` may be multiple lines separated by `\n`. The
first line will always be a short sentence and this is the sentence
shown when running `rclone help flags`.

## Specifying remotes to work on

Remotes are specified with the `fs=`, `srcFs=`, `dstFs=`
parameters depending on the command being used.

The parameters can be a string as per the rest of rclone, eg
`s3:bucket/path` or `:sftp:/my/dir`. They can also be specified as
JSON blobs.

If specifying a JSON blob it should be a object mapping strings to
strings. These values will be used to configure the remote. There are
3 special values which may be set:

- `type` -  set to `type` to specify a remote called `:type:`
- `_name` - set to `name` to specify a remote called `name:`
- `_root` - sets the root of the remote - may be empty

One of `_name` or `type` should normally be set. If the `local`
backend is desired then `type` should be set to `local`. If `_root`
isn't specified then it defaults to the root of the remote.

For example this JSON is equivalent to `remote:/tmp`

```
{
    "_name": "remote",
    "_root": "/tmp"
}
```

And this is equivalent to `:sftp,host='example.com':/tmp`

```
{
    "type": "sftp",
    "host": "example.com",
    "_root": "/tmp"
}
```

And this is equivalent to `/tmp/dir`

```
{
    type = "local",
    _root = "/tmp/dir"
}
```

## Supported commands
{{< rem autogenerated start "- run make rcdocs - don't edit here" >}}
### backend/command: Runs a backend command. {#backend-command}

This takes the following parameters:

- command - a string with the command name
- fs - a remote name string e.g. "drive:"
- arg - a list of arguments for the backend command
- opt - a map of string to string of options

Returns:

- result - result from the backend command

Example:

    rclone rc backend/command command=noop fs=. -o echo=yes -o blue -a path1 -a path2

Returns

```
{
	"result": {
		"arg": [
			"path1",
			"path2"
		],
		"name": "noop",
		"opt": {
			"blue": "",
			"echo": "yes"
		}
	}
}
```

Note that this is the direct equivalent of using this "backend"
command:

    rclone backend noop . -o echo=yes -o blue path1 path2

Note that arguments must be preceded by the "-a" flag

See the [backend](/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more information.

**Authentication is required for this call.**

### cache/expire: Purge a remote from cache {#cache-expire}

Purge a remote from the cache backend. Supports either a directory or a file.
Params:
  - remote = path to remote (required)
  - withData = true/false to delete cached data (chunks) as well (optional)

Eg

    rclone rc cache/expire remote=path/to/sub/folder/
    rclone rc cache/expire remote=/ withData=true

### cache/fetch: Fetch file chunks {#cache-fetch}

Ensure the specified file chunks are cached on disk.

The chunks= parameter specifies the file chunks to check.
It takes a comma separated list of array slice indices.
The slice indices are similar to Python slices: start[:end]

start is the 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the file
to fetch inclusive. end is 0 based chunk number from the beginning
of the file to fetch exclusive.
Both values can be negative, in which case they count from the back
of the file. The value "-5:" represents the last 5 chunks of a file.

Some valid examples are:
":5,-5:" -> the first and last five chunks
"0,-2" -> the first and the second last chunk
"0:10" -> the first ten chunks

Any parameter with a key that starts with "file" can be used to
specify files to fetch, e.g.

    rclone rc cache/fetch chunks=0 file=hello file2=home/goodbye

File names will automatically be encrypted when the a crypt remote
is used on top of the cache.

### core/bwlimit: Set the bandwidth limit. {#core-bwlimit}

This sets the bandwidth limit to the string passed in. This should be
a single bandwidth limit entry or a pair of upload:download bandwidth.

Eg

    rclone rc core/bwlimit rate=off
    {
        "bytesPerSecond": -1,
        "bytesPerSecondTx": -1,

        "bytesPerSecondRx": 131072,
        "rate": "1M"
    }


If the rate parameter is not supplied then the bandwidth is queried

    rclone rc core/bwlimit
    {
        "bytesPerSecond": 1048576,
        "bytesPerSecondTx": 1048576,
        "bytesPerSecondRx": 1048576,
        "rate": "1M"
    }

The format of the parameter is exactly the same as passed to --bwlimit
except only one bandwidth may be specified.

In either case "rate" is returned as a human-readable string, and
"bytesPerSecond" is returned as a number.

### core/command: Run a rclone terminal command over rc. {#core-command}

This takes the following parameters:

- command - a string with the command name.
- arg - a list of arguments for the backend command.
- opt - a map of string to string of options.
- returnType - one of ("COMBINED_OUTPUT", "STREAM", "STREAM_ONLY_STDOUT", "STREAM_ONLY_STDERR").
    - Defaults to "COMBINED_OUTPUT" if not set.
    - The STREAM returnTypes will write the output to the body of the HTTP message.
    - The COMBINED_OUTPUT will write the output to the "result" parameter.

Returns:

- result - result from the backend command.
    - Only set when using returnType "COMBINED_OUTPUT".
- error	 - set if rclone exits with an error code.
- returnType - one of ("COMBINED_OUTPUT", "STREAM", "STREAM_ONLY_STDOUT", "STREAM_ONLY_STDERR").

    rclone rc core/command command=ls -a mydrive:/ -o max-depth=1
    rclone rc core/command -a ls -a mydrive:/ -o max-depth=1

Returns:

```
{
	"error": false,

Returns:

```
{
	"dir": "/",
	"info": {
		"Available": 361769115648,

This tells the go runtime to do a garbage collection run.  It isn't
necessary to call this normally, but it can be useful for debugging
memory problems.

### core/group-list: Returns list of stats. {#core-group-list}

This returns list of stats groups currently in memory. 

Returns the following values:
```
{
	"groups":  an array of group names:
		[
			"group1",
			"group2",
			...
		]
}
```

### core/memstats: Returns the memory statistics {#core-memstats}

This returns the memory statistics of the running program.  What the values mean
are explained in the go docs: https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#MemStats

The most interesting values for most people are:

- HeapAlloc - this is the amount of memory rclone is actually using
- HeapSys - this is the amount of memory rclone has obtained from the OS
- Sys - this is the total amount of memory requested from the OS
   - It is virtual memory so may include unused memory

### core/obscure: Obscures a string passed in. {#core-obscure}

Pass a clear string and rclone will obscure it for the config file:
- clear - string

Returns:
- obscured - string

### core/pid: Return PID of current process {#core-pid}

This returns PID of current process.
Useful for stopping rclone process.

### core/quit: Terminates the app. {#core-quit}

(Optional) Pass an exit code to be used for terminating the app:
- exitCode - int

### core/stats: Returns stats about current transfers. {#core-stats}

This returns all available stats:

	rclone rc core/stats

If group is not provided then summed up stats for all groups will be
returned.

        "serverSideCopyBytes": number bytes server side copied,
        "serverSideMoves": number of server side moves done,
        "serverSideMoveBytes": number bytes server side moved,
	"speed": average speed in bytes per second since start of the group,
	"totalBytes": total number of bytes in the group,

```
Values for "transferring", "checking" and "lastError" are only assigned if data is available.
The value for "eta" is null if an eta cannot be determined.

### core/transferred: Returns stats about completed transfers. {#core-transferred}

This returns stats about completed transfers:

	rclone rc core/transferred

If group is not provided then completed transfers for all groups will be
returned.

Note only the last 100 completed transfers are returned.

Parameters

- group - name of the stats group (string)

Returns the following values:
```

- isBeta - boolean - true if this is a beta version
- os - OS in use as according to Go
- arch - cpu architecture in use according to Go
- goVersion - version of Go runtime in use
- linking - type of rclone executable (static or dynamic)
- goTags - space separated build tags or "none"

### debug/set-block-profile-rate: Set runtime.SetBlockProfileRate for blocking profiling. {#debug-set-block-profile-rate}

SetBlockProfileRate controls the fraction of goroutine blocking events
that are reported in the blocking profile. The profiler aims to sample
an average of one blocking event per rate nanoseconds spent blocked.

To include every blocking event in the profile, pass rate = 1. To turn
off profiling entirely, pass rate <= 0.

After calling this you can use this to see the blocking profile:

    go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/block

Parameters:

- rate - int

### debug/set-gc-percent: Call runtime/debug.SetGCPercent for setting the garbage collection target percentage. {#debug-set-gc-percent}

SetGCPercent sets the garbage collection target percentage: a collection is triggered
when the ratio of freshly allocated data to live data remaining after the previous collection
reaches this percentage. SetGCPercent returns the previous setting. The initial setting is the
value of the GOGC environment variable at startup, or 100 if the variable is not set.

This setting may be effectively reduced in order to maintain a memory limit.
A negative percentage effectively disables garbage collection, unless the memory limit is reached.

See https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/debug#SetMemoryLimit for more details.

Parameters:

- gc-percent - int

### debug/set-mutex-profile-fraction: Set runtime.SetMutexProfileFraction for mutex profiling. {#debug-set-mutex-profile-fraction}

SetMutexProfileFraction controls the fraction of mutex contention
events that are reported in the mutex profile. On average 1/rate
events are reported. The previous rate is returned.

To turn off profiling entirely, pass rate 0. To just read the current
rate, pass rate < 0. (For n>1 the details of sampling may change.)

Once this is set you can look use this to profile the mutex contention:

    go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/mutex

Parameters:

- rate - int

Results:

- previousRate - int

### debug/set-soft-memory-limit: Call runtime/debug.SetMemoryLimit for setting a soft memory limit for the runtime. {#debug-set-soft-memory-limit}

SetMemoryLimit provides the runtime with a soft memory limit.

The runtime undertakes several processes to try to respect this memory limit, including
adjustments to the frequency of garbage collections and returning memory to the underlying
system more aggressively. This limit will be respected even if GOGC=off (or, if SetGCPercent(-1) is executed).

The input limit is provided as bytes, and includes all memory mapped, managed, and not
released by the Go runtime. Notably, it does not account for space used by the Go binary
and memory external to Go, such as memory managed by the underlying system on behalf of
the process, or memory managed by non-Go code inside the same process.
Examples of excluded memory sources include: OS kernel memory held on behalf of the process,
memory allocated by C code, and memory mapped by syscall.Mmap (because it is not managed by the Go runtime).

A zero limit or a limit that's lower than the amount of memory used by the Go runtime may cause
the garbage collector to run nearly continuously. However, the application may still make progress.

The memory limit is always respected by the Go runtime, so to effectively disable this behavior,
set the limit very high. math.MaxInt64 is the canonical value for disabling the limit, but values
much greater than the available memory on the underlying system work just as well.

See https://go.dev/doc/gc-guide for a detailed guide explaining the soft memory limit in more detail,
as well as a variety of common use-cases and scenarios.

SetMemoryLimit returns the previously set memory limit. A negative input does not adjust the limit,
and allows for retrieval of the currently set memory limit.

Parameters:

- mem-limit - int

### fscache/clear: Clear the Fs cache. {#fscache-clear}

This clears the fs cache. This is where remotes created from backends
are cached for a short while to make repeated rc calls more efficient.

If you change the parameters of a backend then you may want to call
this to clear an existing remote out of the cache before re-creating
it.

**Authentication is required for this call.**

    rclone rc mount/mount fs=TestDrive: mountPoint=/mnt/tmp vfsOpt='{"CacheMode": 2}' mountOpt='{"AllowOther": true}'

The vfsOpt are as described in options/get and can be seen in the the
"vfs" section when running and the mountOpt can be seen in the "mount" section:

    rclone rc options/get

**Authentication is required for this call.**

### mount/types: Show all possible mount types {#mount-types}

This shows all possible mount types and returns them as a list.

This takes no parameters and returns

- mountTypes: list of mount types

The mount types are strings like "mount", "mount2", "cmount" and can
be passed to mount/mount as the mountType parameter.

Eg

    rclone rc mount/types

**Authentication is required for this call.**

### mount/unmount: Unmount selected active mount {#mount-unmount}

    rclone rc mount/unmountall

**Authentication is required for this call.**

### operations/about: Return the space used on the remote {#operations-about}

This takes the following parameters:

- fs - a remote name string e.g. "drive:"

The result is as returned from rclone about --json

See the [about](/commands/rclone_about/) command for more information on the above.

**Authentication is required for this call.**

### operations/check: check the source and destination are the same {#operations-check}

Checks the files in the source and destination match.  It compares
sizes and hashes and logs a report of files that don't
match.  It doesn't alter the source or destination.

This takes the following parameters:

- srcFs - a remote name string e.g. "drive:" for the source, "/" for local filesystem
- dstFs - a remote name string e.g. "drive2:" for the destination, "/" for local filesystem
- download - check by downloading rather than with hash
- checkFileHash - treat checkFileFs:checkFileRemote as a SUM file with hashes of given type
- checkFileFs - treat checkFileFs:checkFileRemote as a SUM file with hashes of given type
- checkFileRemote - treat checkFileFs:checkFileRemote as a SUM file with hashes of given type
- oneWay -  check one way only, source files must exist on remote
- combined - make a combined report of changes (default false)
- missingOnSrc - report all files missing from the source (default true)
- missingOnDst - report all files missing from the destination (default true)
- match - report all matching files (default false)
- differ - report all non-matching files (default true)
- error - report all files with errors (hashing or reading) (default true)

If you supply the download flag, it will download the data from
both remotes and check them against each other on the fly.  This can
be useful for remotes that don't support hashes or if you really want
to check all the data.

If you supply the size-only global flag, it will only compare the sizes not
the hashes as well.  Use this for a quick check.

If you supply the checkFileHash option with a valid hash name, the
checkFileFs:checkFileRemote must point to a text file in the SUM
format. This treats the checksum file as the source and dstFs as the
destination. Note that srcFs is not used and should not be supplied in
this case.

Returns:

- success - true if no error, false otherwise
- status - textual summary of check, OK or text string
- hashType - hash used in check, may be missing
- combined - array of strings of combined report of changes
- missingOnSrc - array of strings of all files missing from the source
- missingOnDst - array of strings of all files missing from the destination
- match - array of strings of all matching files
- differ - array of strings of all non-matching files
- error - array of strings of all files with errors (hashing or reading)

This command does not have a command line equivalent so use this instead:

    rclone rc --loopback operations/fsinfo fs=remote:

### operations/hashsum: Produces a hashsum file for all the objects in the path. {#operations-hashsum}

Produces a hash file for all the objects in the path using the hash
named.  The output is in the same format as the standard
md5sum/sha1sum tool.

This takes the following parameters:

- fs - a remote name string e.g. "drive:" for the source, "/" for local filesystem
    - this can point to a file and just that file will be returned in the listing.
- hashType - type of hash to be used
- download - check by downloading rather than with hash (boolean)
- base64 - output the hashes in base64 rather than hex (boolean)

If you supply the download flag, it will download the data from the
remote and create the hash on the fly. This can be useful for remotes
that don't support the given hash or if you really want to check all
the data.

Note that if you wish to supply a checkfile to check hashes against
the current files then you should use operations/check instead of
operations/hashsum.

Returns:

- hashsum - array of strings of the hashes
- hashType - type of hash used

Example:

    $ rclone rc --loopback operations/hashsum fs=bin hashType=MD5 download=true base64=true

### options/blocks: List all the option blocks {#options-blocks}

Returns:
- options - a list of the options block names

### options/get: Get all the global options {#options-get}

Returns an object where keys are option block names and values are an
object with the current option values in.

Parameters:

- blocks: optional string of comma separated blocks to include
    - all are included if this is missing or ""

Note that these are the global options which are unaffected by use of
the _config and _filter parameters. If you wish to read the parameters
set in _config then use options/config and for _filter use options/filter.

This shows the internal names of the option within rclone which should
map to the external options very easily with a few exceptions.

### options/info: Get info about all the global options {#options-info}

Returns an object where keys are option block names and values are an
array of objects with info about each options.

Parameters:

- blocks: optional string of comma separated blocks to include

These objects are in the same format as returned by "config/providers". They are
described in the [option blocks](#option-blocks) section.

### options/local: Get the currently active config for this call {#options-local}

Returns an object with the keys "config" and "filter".
The "config" key contains the local config and the "filter" key contains
the local filters.

Note that these are the local options specific to this rc call. If
_config was not supplied then they will be the global options.
Likewise with "_filter".

This call is mostly useful for seeing if _config and _filter passing
is working.

This shows the internal names of the option within rclone which should
map to the external options very easily with a few exceptions.

### options/set: Set an option {#options-set}

Parameters:

- option block name containing an object with
  - key: value

Repeated as often as required.

Only supply the options you wish to change.  If an option is unknown
it will be silently ignored.  Not all options will have an effect when
changed like this.

For example:

This sets DEBUG level logs (-vv) (these can be set by number or string)

    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": "DEBUG"}}'
    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": 8}}'

And this sets INFO level logs (-v)

    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": "INFO"}}'

And this sets NOTICE level logs (normal without -v)

    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": "NOTICE"}}'

### vfs/forget: Forget files or directories in the directory cache. {#vfs-forget}

This forgets the paths in the directory cache causing them to be
re-read from the remote when needed.

If no paths are passed in then it will forget all the paths in the
directory cache.

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Otherwise pass files or dirs in as file=path or dir=path.  Any
parameter key starting with file will forget that file and any
starting with dir will forget that dir, e.g.

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=hello file2=goodbye dir=home/junk
 
This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not
supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be
used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter
must be supplied.

### vfs/list: List active VFSes. {#vfs-list}

This lists the active VFSes.

It returns a list under the key "vfses" where the values are the VFS
names that could be passed to the other VFS commands in the "fs"
parameter.

### vfs/poll-interval: Get the status or update the value of the poll-interval option. {#vfs-poll-interval}

Without any parameter given this returns the current status of the
poll-interval setting.

When the interval=duration parameter is set, the poll-interval value
is updated and the polling function is notified.
Setting interval=0 disables poll-interval.

    rclone rc vfs/poll-interval interval=5m

The timeout=duration parameter can be used to specify a time to wait
for the current poll function to apply the new value.
If timeout is less or equal 0, which is the default, wait indefinitely.

The new poll-interval value will only be active when the timeout is
not reached.

If poll-interval is updated or disabled temporarily, some changes
might not get picked up by the polling function, depending on the
used remote.
 
This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not
supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be
used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter
must be supplied.

### vfs/queue: Queue info for a VFS. {#vfs-queue}

This returns info about the upload queue for the selected VFS.

This is only useful if `--vfs-cache-mode` > off. If you call it when
the `--vfs-cache-mode` is off, it will return an empty result.

    {
        "queued": // an array of files queued for upload
        [
            {
                "name":      "file",   // string: name (full path) of the file,
                "id":        123,      // integer: id of this item in the queue,
                "size":      79,       // integer: size of the file in bytes
                "expiry":    1.5       // float: time until file is eligible for transfer, lowest goes first
                "tries":     1,        // integer: number of times we have tried to upload
                "delay":     5.0,      // float: seconds between upload attempts
                "uploading": false,    // boolean: true if item is being uploaded
            },
       ],
    }

The `expiry` time is the time until the file is eligible for being
uploaded in floating point seconds. This may go negative. As rclone
only transfers `--transfers` files at once, only the lowest
`--transfers` expiry times will have `uploading` as `true`. So there
may be files with negative expiry times for which `uploading` is
`false`.

 
This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not
supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be
used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter
must be supplied.

### vfs/queue-set-expiry: Set the expiry time for an item queued for upload. {#vfs-queue-set-expiry}

Use this to adjust the `expiry` time for an item in the upload queue.
You will need to read the `id` of the item using `vfs/queue` before
using this call.

You can then set `expiry` to a floating point number of seconds from
now when the item is eligible for upload. If you want the item to be
uploaded as soon as possible then set it to a large negative number (eg
-1000000000). If you want the upload of the item to be delayed
for a long time then set it to a large positive number.

Setting the `expiry` of an item which has already has started uploading
will have no effect - the item will carry on being uploaded.

This will return an error if called with `--vfs-cache-mode` off or if
the `id` passed is not found.

This takes the following parameters

- `fs` - select the VFS in use (optional)
- `id` - a numeric ID as returned from `vfs/queue`
- `expiry` - a new expiry time as floating point seconds
- `relative` - if set, expiry is to be treated as relative to the current expiry (optional, boolean)

This returns an empty result on success, or an error.

 
This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not
supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be
used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter
must be supplied.

### vfs/refresh: Refresh the directory cache. {#vfs-refresh}

This reads the directories for the specified paths and freshens the
directory cache.

If no paths are passed in then it will refresh the root directory.

    rclone rc vfs/refresh

Otherwise pass directories in as dir=path. Any parameter key
starting with dir will refresh that directory, e.g.

    rclone rc vfs/refresh dir=home/junk dir2=data/misc

If the parameter recursive=true is given the whole directory tree
will get refreshed. This refresh will use --fast-list if enabled.
 
This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not
supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be
used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter
must be supplied.

### vfs/stats: Stats for a VFS. {#vfs-stats}

This returns stats for the selected VFS.

    {
        // Status of the disk cache - only present if --vfs-cache-mode > off
        "diskCache": {
            "bytesUsed": 0,
            "erroredFiles": 0,
            "files": 0,
            "hashType": 1,
            "outOfSpace": false,
            "path": "/home/user/.cache/rclone/vfs/local/mnt/a",
            "pathMeta": "/home/user/.cache/rclone/vfsMeta/local/mnt/a",
            "uploadsInProgress": 0,
            "uploadsQueued": 0
        },
        "fs": "/mnt/a",
        "inUse": 1,
        // Status of the in memory metadata cache
        "metadataCache": {
            "dirs": 1,
            "files": 0
        },
        // Options as returned by options/get
        "opt": {
            "CacheMaxAge": 3600000000000,
            // ...
            "WriteWait": 1000000000
        }
    }

 
This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not
supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be
used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter
must be supplied.

## Accessing the remote control via HTTP {#api-http}

Rclone implements a simple HTTP based protocol.

Each endpoint takes an JSON object and returns a JSON object or an
error.  The JSON objects are essentially a map of string names to
values.

All calls must made using POST.

The input objects can be supplied using URL parameters, POST
parameters or by supplying "Content-Type: application/json" and a JSON
blob in the body.  There are examples of these below using `curl`.

The response will be a JSON blob in the body of the response.  This is
formatted to be reasonably human-readable.

### Error returns

If an error occurs then there will be an HTTP error status (e.g. 500)
and the body of the response will contain a JSON encoded error object,
e.g.

```
{
    "error": "Expecting string value for key \"remote\" (was float64)",
    "input": {
        "fs": "/tmp",
        "remote": 3
    },
    "status": 400
    "path": "operations/rmdir",
}
```

The keys in the error response are
- error - error string
- input - the input parameters to the call
- status - the HTTP status code
- path - the path of the call

### CORS

The sever implements basic CORS support and allows all origins for that.
The response to a preflight OPTIONS request will echo the requested "Access-Control-Request-Headers" back.

### Using POST with URL parameters only

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5572/rc/noop?potato=1&sausage=2'
```

Response

```
{
	"potato": "1",
	"sausage": "2"
}
```

Here is what an error response looks like:

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5572/rc/error?potato=1&sausage=2'
```

```
{
	"error": "arbitrary error on input map[potato:1 sausage:2]",
	"input": {
		"potato": "1",
		"sausage": "2"
	}
}
```

Note that curl doesn't return errors to the shell unless you use the `-f` option

```
$ curl -f -X POST 'http://localhost:5572/rc/error?potato=1&sausage=2'
curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 400 Bad Request
$ echo $?
22
```

### Using POST with a form

```
curl --data "potato=1" --data "sausage=2" http://localhost:5572/rc/noop
```

Response

```
{
	"potato": "1",
	"sausage": "2"
}
```

Note that you can combine these with URL parameters too with the POST
parameters taking precedence.

```
curl --data "potato=1" --data "sausage=2" "http://localhost:5572/rc/noop?rutabaga=3&sausage=4"
```

Response

```
{
	"potato": "1",
	"rutabaga": "3",
	"sausage": "4"
}

```

### Using POST with a JSON blob

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"potato":2,"sausage":1}' http://localhost:5572/rc/noop
```

response

```
{
	"password": "xyz",
	"username": "xyz"
}
```

This can be combined with URL parameters too if required.  The JSON
blob takes precedence.

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"potato":2,"sausage":1}' 'http://localhost:5572/rc/noop?rutabaga=3&potato=4'
```

```
{
	"potato": 2,
	"rutabaga": "3",
	"sausage": 1
}
```

## Debugging rclone with pprof ##

If you use the `--rc` flag this will also enable the use of the go
profiling tools on the same port.

To use these, first [install go](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Debugging memory use

To profile rclone's memory use you can run:

    go tool pprof -web http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap

This should open a page in your browser showing what is using what
memory.

You can also use the `-text` flag to produce a textual summary

```
$ go tool pprof -text http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap

### Debugging go routine leaks

Memory leaks are most often caused by go routine leaks keeping memory
alive which should have been garbage collected.

See all active go routines using

    curl http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1

Or go to http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1 in your browser.

### Other profiles to look at

You can see a summary of profiles available at http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/

Here is how to use some of them:

- Memory: `go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap`
- Go routines: `curl http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1`
- 30-second CPU profile: `go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/profile`
- 5-second execution trace: `wget http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/trace?seconds=5`
- Goroutine blocking profile
    - Enable first with: `rclone rc debug/set-block-profile-rate rate=1` ([docs](#debug-set-block-profile-rate))
    - `go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/block`
- Contended mutexes:
    - Enable first with: `rclone rc debug/set-mutex-profile-fraction rate=1` ([docs](#debug-set-mutex-profile-fraction))
    - `go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/mutex`

See the [net/http/pprof docs](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/)
for more info on how to use the profiling and for a general overview
see [the Go team's blog post on profiling go programs](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs).

The profiling hook is [zero overhead unless it is used](https://stackoverflow.com/q/26545159/164234).
