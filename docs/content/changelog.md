    * Files will be copied to a temporary name ending in `.partial` when copying to `local`,`ftp`,`sftp` then renamed at the end of the transfer. (Janne Hellsten, Nick Craig-Wood)
        * This helps with data integrity as we don't delete the existing file until the new one is complete.

    * The [--default-time](/docs/#default-time-time) flag now controls the unknown modification time of files/dirs (Nick Craig-Wood)
        * If a file or directory does not have a modification time rclone can read then rclone will display this fixed time instead.
