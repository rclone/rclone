# rclone link

Generate public link to file/folder.

## Synopsis


rclone link will create or retrieve a public link to the given file or folder.

    rclone link remote:path/to/file
    rclone link remote:path/to/folder/

If successful, the last line of the output will contain the link. Exact
capabilities depend on the remote, but the link will always be created with
the least constraints – e.g. no expiry, no password protection, accessible
without account.


```
rclone link remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for link
```

See the [global flags page](/flags/) for global options not listed here.
