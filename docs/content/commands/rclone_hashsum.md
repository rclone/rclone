# rclone hashsum

Produces a hashsum file for all the objects in the path.

## Synopsis


Produces a hash file for all the objects in the path using the hash
named.  The output is in the same format as the standard

    $ rclone hashsum
    Supported hashes are:
      * MD5
      * SHA-1
      * DropboxHash
      * QuickXorHash

Then

    $ rclone hashsum MD5 remote:path


```
rclone hashsum <hash> remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --base64   Output base64 encoded hashsum
  -h, --help     help for hashsum
```

See the [global flags page](/flags/) for global options not listed here.
