# rclone authorize

Remote authorization.

## Synopsis

Remote authorization. Used to authorize a remote or headless
rclone from a machine with a browser - use as instructed by
rclone config.

Use --auth-no-open-browser to prevent rclone to open auth
link in default browser automatically.

Use --template to generate HTML output via a custom Go template. If a blank string is provided as an argument to this flag, the default template is used.

```
rclone authorize [flags]
```

      --template string        The path to a custom Go template for generating HTML responses
