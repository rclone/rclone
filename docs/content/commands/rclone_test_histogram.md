The data doesn't contain any identifying information but is useful for
the rclone developers when developing filename compression.


```
rclone test histogram [remote:path] [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for histogram
```

See the [global flags page](/flags/) for global options not listed here.
