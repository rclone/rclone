# rclone dedupe

Interactively find duplicate filenames and delete/rename them.

## Synopsis



By default `dedupe` interactively finds files with duplicate
names and offers to delete all but one or rename them to be
different. This is known as deduping by name.

Deduping by name is only useful with a small group of backends (e.g. Google Drive,
Opendrive) that can have duplicate file names. It can be run on wrapping backends
(e.g. crypt) if they wrap a backend which supports duplicate file
names.

However if --by-hash is passed in then dedupe will find files with
duplicate hashes instead which will work on any backend which supports
at least one hash. This can be used to find files with duplicate
content. This is known as deduping by hash.

If deduping by name, first rclone will merge directories with the same
name.  It will do this iteratively until all the identically named
directories have been merged.

Next, if deduping by name, for every group of duplicate file names /
hashes, it will delete all but one identical files it finds without
confirmation.  This means that for most duplicated files the `dedupe` command will not be interactive.

`dedupe` considers files to be identical if they have the
same file path and the same hash. If the backend does not support hashes (e.g. crypt wrapping
Google Drive) then they will never be found to be identical. If you
use the `--size-only` flag then files will be considered
identical if they have the same size (any hash will be ignored). This
can be useful on crypt backends which do not support hashes.

Next rclone will resolve the remaining duplicates. Exactly which
action is taken depends on the dedupe mode. By default rclone will
interactively query the user for each one.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.

Here is an example run.

Before - with duplicates

    $ rclone lsl drive:dupes
      6048320 2016-03-05 16:23:16.798000000 one.txt
      6048320 2016-03-05 16:23:11.775000000 one.txt
       564374 2016-03-05 16:23:06.731000000 one.txt
      6048320 2016-03-05 16:18:26.092000000 one.txt
      6048320 2016-03-05 16:22:46.185000000 two.txt
      1744073 2016-03-05 16:22:38.104000000 two.txt
       564374 2016-03-05 16:22:52.118000000 two.txt

Now the `dedupe` session

    $ rclone dedupe drive:dupes
    2016/03/05 16:24:37 Google drive root 'dupes': Looking for duplicates using interactive mode.
    one.txt: Found 4 files with duplicate names
    one.txt: Deleting 2/3 identical duplicates (MD5 "1eedaa9fe86fd4b8632e2ac549403b36")

    s) Skip and do nothing
    k) Keep just one (choose which in next step)
    r) Rename all to be different (by changing file.jpg to file-1.jpg)

    two-1.txt: renamed from: two.txt
    two-2.txt: renamed from: two.txt
    two-3.txt: renamed from: two.txt

The result being

    $ rclone lsl drive:dupes
      6048320 2016-03-05 16:23:16.798000000 one.txt
       564374 2016-03-05 16:22:52.118000000 two-1.txt
      6048320 2016-03-05 16:22:46.185000000 two-2.txt
      1744073 2016-03-05 16:22:38.104000000 two-3.txt

Dedupe can be run non interactively using the `--dedupe-mode` flag or by using an extra parameter with the same value

  * `--dedupe-mode interactive` - interactive as above.
  * `--dedupe-mode skip` - removes identical files then skips anything left.
  * `--dedupe-mode first` - removes identical files then keeps the first one.
  * `--dedupe-mode newest` - removes identical files then keeps the newest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode oldest` - removes identical files then keeps the oldest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode largest` - removes identical files then keeps the largest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode smallest` - removes identical files then keeps the smallest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode rename` - removes identical files then renames the rest to be different.
  * `--dedupe-mode list` - lists duplicate dirs and files only and changes nothing.

For example to rename all the identically named photos in your Google Photos directory, do

    rclone dedupe --dedupe-mode rename "drive:Google Photos"

Or

    rclone dedupe rename "drive:Google Photos"


```
rclone dedupe [mode] remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --by-hash              Find indentical hashes rather than names
      --dedupe-mode string   Dedupe mode interactive|skip|first|newest|oldest|largest|smallest|rename. (default "interactive")
  -h, --help                 help for dedupe
```

See the [global flags page](/flags/) for global options not listed here.
