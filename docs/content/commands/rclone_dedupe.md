# rclone dedupe

Interactively find duplicate files and delete/rename them.

## Synopsis


By default `dedupe` interactively finds duplicate files and offers to
delete all but one or rename them to be different. Only useful with
Google Drive which can have duplicate file names.

In the first pass it will merge directories with the same name.  It
will do this iteratively until all the identical directories have been
merged.

The `dedupe` command will delete all but one of any identical (same
md5sum) files it finds without confirmation.  This means that for most
duplicated files the `dedupe` command will not be interactive.  You
can use `--dry-run` to see what would happen without doing anything.

Here is an example run.

Before - with duplicates

    $ rclone lsl drive:dupes
      6048320 2016-03-05 16:23:16.798000000 one.txt
      6048320 2016-03-05 16:23:11.775000000 one.txt
       564374 2016-03-05 16:23:06.731000000 one.txt
      6048320 2016-03-05 16:18:26.092000000 one.txt
      6048320 2016-03-05 16:22:46.185000000 two.txt
      1744073 2016-03-05 16:22:38.104000000 two.txt
       564374 2016-03-05 16:22:52.118000000 two.txt

Now the `dedupe` session

    $ rclone dedupe drive:dupes
    2016/03/05 16:24:37 Google drive root 'dupes': Looking for duplicates using interactive mode.

    two-2.txt: renamed from: two.txt
    two-3.txt: renamed from: two.txt

The result being

    $ rclone lsl drive:dupes
      6048320 2016-03-05 16:23:16.798000000 one.txt
       564374 2016-03-05 16:22:52.118000000 two-1.txt

Dedupe can be run non interactively using the `--dedupe-mode` flag or by using an extra parameter with the same value

  * `--dedupe-mode interactive` - interactive as above.
  * `--dedupe-mode skip` - removes identical files then skips anything left.
  * `--dedupe-mode first` - removes identical files then keeps the first one.
  * `--dedupe-mode newest` - removes identical files then keeps the newest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode oldest` - removes identical files then keeps the oldest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode largest` - removes identical files then keeps the largest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode smallest` - removes identical files then keeps the smallest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode rename` - removes identical files then renames the rest to be different.

For example to rename all the identically named photos in your Google Photos directory, do

    rclone dedupe --dedupe-mode rename "drive:Google Photos"

Or

    rclone dedupe rename "drive:Google Photos"


```
rclone dedupe [mode] remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --dedupe-mode string   Dedupe mode interactive|skip|first|newest|oldest|largest|smallest|rename. (default "interactive")
  -h, --help                 help for dedupe
```

See the [global flags page](/flags/) for global options not listed here.
