# rclone copyurl

Copy the contents of the URL supplied content to dest:path.

## Synopsis

Download a URL's content and copy it to the destination without saving
it in temporary storage.

Setting `--auto-filename` will attempt to automatically determine the
filename from the URL (after any redirections) and used in the
destination path.

With `--auto-filename-header` in addition, if a specific filename is
set in HTTP headers, it will be used instead of the name from the URL.
With `--print-filename` in addition, the resulting file name will be
printed.

Setting `--no-clobber` will prevent overwriting file on the 
destination if there is one with the same name.

Setting `--stdout` or making the output file name `-`
will cause the output to be written to standard output.

## Troublshooting

If you can't get `rclone copyurl` to work then here are some things you can try:

- `--disable-http2` rclone will use HTTP2 if available - try disabling it
- `--bind 0.0.0.0` rclone will use IPv6 if available - try disabling it
- `--bind ::0` to disable IPv4
- `--user agent curl` - some sites have whitelists for curl's user-agent - try that
- Make sure the site works with `curl` directly
