# rclone size

Prints the total size and number of objects in remote:path.

## Synopsis


Counts objects in the path and calculates the total size. Prints the
result to standard output.

By default the output is in human-readable format, but shows values in
both human-readable format as well as the raw numbers (global option
`--human-readable` is not considered). Use option `--json`
to format output as JSON instead.

Recurses by default, use `--max-depth 1` to stop the
recursion.

Some backends do not always provide file sizes, see for example
[Google Photos](/googlephotos/#size) and
[Google Drive](/drive/#limitations-of-google-docs).
Rclone will then show a notice in the log indicating how many such
files were encountered, and count them in as empty files in the output
of the size command.


```
rclone size remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for size
      --json   Format output as JSON
```

See the [global flags page](/flags/) for global options not listed here.
