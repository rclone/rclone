# rclone lsf

List directories and objects in remote:path formatted for parsing.

## Synopsis


List the contents of the source path (directories and objects) to
standard output in a form which is easy to parse by scripts.  By
default this will just be the names of the objects and directories,
one per line.  The directories will have a / suffix.

Eg

    $ rclone lsf swift:bucket
    bevajer5jef
    canole
    diwogej7
    ferejej3gux/
    fubuwic

Use the --format option to control what gets listed.  By default this
is just the path, but you can use these parameters to control the
output:

    p - path
    s - size
    t - modification time
    h - hash
    i - ID of object
    o - Original ID of underlying object
    m - MimeType of object if known
    e - encrypted name
    T - tier of storage if known, e.g. "Hot" or "Cool"

So if you wanted the path, size and modification time, you would use
--format "pst", or maybe --format "tsp" to put the path last.

Eg

    $ rclone lsf  --format "tsp" swift:bucket
    2016-06-25 18:55:41;60295;bevajer5jef
    2016-06-25 18:55:43;90613;canole
    2016-06-25 18:55:43;94467;diwogej7

If you specify "h" in the format you will get the MD5 hash by default,
use the "--hash" flag to change which hash you want.  Note that this
can be returned as an empty string if it isn't available on the object
(and for directories), "ERROR" if there was an error reading it from
the object and "UNSUPPORTED" if that object does not support that hash
type.

For example, to emulate the md5sum command you can use

    rclone lsf -R --hash MD5 --format hp --separator "  " --files-only .

Eg

    $ rclone lsf -R --hash MD5 --format hp --separator "  " --files-only swift:bucket
    7908e352297f0f530b84a756f188baa3  bevajer5jef
    cd65ac234e6fea5925974a51cdd865cc  canole
    03b5341b4f234b9d984d03ad076bae91  diwogej7
    8fd37c3810dd660778137ac3a66cc06d  fubuwic
    99713e14a4c4ff553acaf1930fad985b  gixacuh7ku

(Though "rclone md5sum ." is an easier way of typing this.)

By default the separator is ";" this can be changed with the
--separator flag.  Note that separators aren't escaped in the path so
putting it last is a good strategy.

Eg

    $ rclone lsf  --separator "," --format "tshp" swift:bucket

You can output in CSV standard format.  This will escape things in "
if they contain ,

Eg

    $ rclone lsf --csv --files-only --format ps remote:path
    test.log,22355
    test.sh,449
    "this file contains a comma, in the file name.txt",6

Note that the --absolute parameter is useful for making lists of files
to pass to an rclone copy with the --files-from-raw flag.

For example, to find all the files modified within one day and copy
those only (without traversing the whole directory structure):

    rclone lsf --absolute --files-only --max-age 1d /path/to/local > new_files
    rclone copy --files-from-raw new_files /path/to/local remote:path


Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.

There are several related list commands

  * `ls` to list size and path of objects only
  * `lsl` to list modification time, size and path of objects only
  * `lsd` to list directories only
  * `lsf` to list objects and directories in easy to parse format
  * `lsjson` to list objects and directories in JSON format

`ls`,`lsl`,`lsd` are designed to be human-readable.
`lsf` is designed to be human and machine-readable.
`lsjson` is designed to be machine-readable.

Note that `ls` and `lsl` recurse by default - use `--max-depth 1` to stop the recursion.

The other list commands `lsd`,`lsf`,`lsjson` do not recurse by default - use `-R` to make them recurse.

Listing a non-existent directory will produce an error except for
remotes which can't have empty directories (e.g. s3, swift, or gcs -
the bucket-based remotes).


```
rclone lsf remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --absolute           Put a leading / in front of path names

      --dirs-only          Only list directories
      --files-only         Only list files
  -F, --format string      Output format - see  help for details (default "p")
      --hash h             Use this hash when h is used in the format MD5|SHA-1|DropboxHash (default "md5")
  -h, --help               help for lsf
  -R, --recursive          Recurse into the listing
