# rclone touch

Create new file or change file modification time.

## Synopsis


Set the modification time on object(s) as specified by remote:path to
have the current time.

If remote:path does not exist then a zero sized object will be created
unless the --no-create flag is provided.

If --timestamp is used then it will set the modification time to that
time instead of the current time. Times may be specified as one of:

- 'YYMMDD' - eg. 17.10.30
- 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS' - eg. 2006-01-02T15:04:05

Note that --timestamp is in UTC if you want local time then add the
--localtime flag.


```
rclone touch remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help               help for touch
      --localtime          Use localtime for timestamp, not UTC.
  -C, --no-create          Do not create the file if it does not exist.
  -t, --timestamp string   Use specified time instead of the current time of day.
```

See the [global flags page](/flags/) for global options not listed here.
