# rclone lsjson

List directories and objects in the path in JSON format.

## Synopsis

List directories and objects in the path in JSON format.

The output is an array of Items, where each Item looks like this:

    {
      "Hashes" : {
         "SHA-1" : "f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f",
         "MD5" : "b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184",
         "DropboxHash" : "ecb65bb98f9d905b70458986c39fcbad7715e5f2fcc3b1f07767d7c83e2438cc"
      },
      "ID": "y2djkhiujf83u33",
      "OrigID": "UYOJVTUW00Q1RzTDA",
      "IsBucket" : false,
      "IsDir" : false,
      "MimeType" : "application/octet-stream",
      "ModTime" : "2017-05-31T16:15:57.034468261+01:00",
      "Name" : "file.txt",
      "Encrypted" : "v0qpsdq8anpci8n929v3uu9338",
      "EncryptedPath" : "kja9098349023498/v0qpsdq8anpci8n929v3uu9338",
      "Path" : "full/path/goes/here/file.txt",
      "Size" : 6,
      "Tier" : "hot",
    }

The exact set of properties included depends on the backend:

- The property IsBucket will only be included for bucket-based remotes, and only
  for directories that are buckets. It will always be omitted when value is not true.
- Properties Encrypted and EncryptedPath will only be included for encrypted
  remotes, and (as mentioned below) only if the `--encrypted` option is set.

Different options may also affect which properties are included:

- If `--hash` is not specified, the Hashes property will be omitted. The
  types of hash can be specified with the `--hash-type` parameter (which
  may be repeated). If `--hash-type` is set then it implies `--hash`.
- If `--no-modtime` is specified then ModTime will be blank. This can
  speed things up on remotes where reading the ModTime takes an extra
  request (e.g. s3, swift).
- If `--no-mimetype` is specified then MimeType will be blank. This can
  speed things up on remotes where reading the MimeType takes an extra
  request (e.g. s3, swift).
- If `--encrypted` is not specified the Encrypted and EncryptedPath
  properties will be omitted - even for encrypted remotes.
- If `--metadata` is set then an additional Metadata property will be
  returned. This will have [metadata](/docs/#metadata) in rclone standard format
  as a JSON object.

The default is to list directories and files/objects, but this can be changed
with the following options:

- If `--dirs-only` is specified then directories will be returned
  only, no files/objects.
- If `--files-only` is specified then files will be returned only,
  no directories.

If `--stat` is set then the the output is not an array of items,
but instead a single JSON blob will be returned about the item pointed to.
This will return an error if the item isn't found, however on bucket based
backends (like s3, gcs, b2, azureblob etc) if the item isn't found it will
return an empty directory, as it isn't possible to tell empty directories
from missing directories there.

The Path field will only show folders below the remote path being listed.
If "remote:path" contains the file "subfolder/file.txt", the Path for "file.txt"
will be "subfolder/file.txt", not "remote:path/subfolder/file.txt".
When used without `--recursive` the Path will always be the same as Name.

The time is in RFC3339 format with up to nanosecond precision.  The
number of decimal digits in the seconds will depend on the precision
that the remote can hold the times, so if times are accurate to the
nearest millisecond (e.g. Google Drive) then 3 digits will always be
shown ("2017-05-31T16:15:57.034+01:00") whereas if the times are
accurate to the nearest second (Dropbox, Box, WebDav, etc.) no digits
will be shown ("2017-05-31T16:15:57+01:00").

The whole output can be processed as a JSON blob, or alternatively it
can be processed line by line as each item is written on individual lines
(except with `--stat`).

Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.

There are several related list commands

  * `ls` to list size and path of objects only
  * `lsl` to list modification time, size and path of objects only
  * `lsd` to list directories only
  * `lsf` to list objects and directories in easy to parse format
  * `lsjson` to list objects and directories in JSON format

`ls`,`lsl`,`lsd` are designed to be human-readable.
`lsf` is designed to be human and machine-readable.
`lsjson` is designed to be machine-readable.

Note that `ls` and `lsl` recurse by default - use `--max-depth 1` to stop the recursion.

The other list commands `lsd`,`lsf`,`lsjson` do not recurse by default - use `-R` to make them recurse.

Listing a nonexistent directory will produce an error except for
remotes which can't have empty directories (e.g. s3, swift, or gcs -
the bucket-based remotes).
