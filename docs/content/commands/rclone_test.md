Run a test command

## Synopsis

Rclone test is used to run test commands.

Select which test comand you want with the subcommand, eg

    rclone test memory remote:

Each subcommand has its own options which you can see in their help.

**NB** Be careful running these commands, they may do strange things
so reading their documentation first is recommended.
