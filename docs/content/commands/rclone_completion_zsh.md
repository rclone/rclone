# rclone completion zsh

Output zsh completion script for rclone.

## Synopsis

Generates a zsh autocompletion script for rclone.

This writes to /usr/share/zsh/vendor-completions/_rclone by default so will
probably need to be run with sudo or as root, e.g.

    sudo rclone completion zsh

Logout and login again to use the autocompletion scripts, or source
them directly

    autoload -U compinit && compinit

If you supply a command line argument the script will be written
there.

If output_file is "-", then the output will be written to stdout.


```
rclone completion zsh [output_file] [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for zsh
```

See the [global flags page](/flags/) for global options not listed here.
