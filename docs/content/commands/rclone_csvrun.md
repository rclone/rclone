# rclone csvrun

Read a CSV file and perform file operations (copy/move).

## Synopsis

Reads a CSV file and performs file operations (copy or move) for each row.
The CSV file must have a header row and the following columns:
SourceRemote, SourcePath, TargetRemote, TargetPath, [Mode]

- SourceRemote: The rclone remote name (e.g., "drive:") or empty for local.
- SourcePath: The path to the source file.
- TargetRemote: The rclone remote name (e.g., "backup:") or empty for local.
- TargetPath: The path to the destination file.
- Mode (Optional): The operation to perform: "copy" or "move". Overrides the --mode flag.

The first row of the CSV is expected to be a header and will be skipped.
If the "Mode" column is not present in the CSV, the --mode flag must be specified.
If both are present, the CSV column takes precedence for that row.

This command efficiently reuses remote connections (Fs objects) to optimize session
token usage and supports parallel execution using --transfers.

Example CSV:
```csv
SourceRemote,SourcePath,TargetRemote,TargetPath,Mode
drive:,/docs/report.pdf,backup:,/2023/report.pdf,copy
s3:,bucket/image.jpg,drive:,/images/image.jpg,move
drive:,/data/log.txt,backup:,/logs/log.txt,
```

Example usage:
```sh
rclone csvrun transfer_list.csv --mode copy
rclone csvrun move_list.csv --mode move
```


```
rclone csvrun csv_file [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help          help for csvrun
      --mode string   Operation mode: copy or move (default "copy")
```

See the [global flags page](/flags/) for global options not listed here.
