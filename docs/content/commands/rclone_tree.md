## rclone tree

List the contents of the remote in a tree like fashion.

### Synopsis


rclone tree lists the contents of a remote in a similar way to the
unix tree command.

For example

    $ rclone tree remote:path
    /
    ├── file1
    ├── file2
    ├── file3
    └── subdir
        ├── file4
        └── file5
    
    1 directories, 5 files

You can use any of the filtering options with the tree command (eg
--include and --exclude).  You can also use --fast-list.

The tree command has many options for controlling the listing which
are compatible with the tree command.  Note that not all of them have
short options as they conflict with rclone's short options.


```
