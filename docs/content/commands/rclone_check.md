# rclone check

Checks the files in the source and destination match.

## Synopsis

Checks the files in the source and destination match.  It compares
sizes and hashes (MD5 or SHA1) and logs a report of files that don't
match.  It doesn't alter the source or destination.

For the [crypt](/crypt/) remote there is a dedicated command,
[cryptcheck](/commands/rclone_cryptcheck/), that are able to check
the checksums of the encrypted files.

If you supply the `--size-only` flag, it will only compare the sizes not
the hashes as well.  Use this for a quick check.

If you supply the `--download` flag, it will download the data from
both remotes and check them against each other on the fly.  This can
be useful for remotes that don't support hashes or if you really want
to check all the data.

If you supply the `--checkfile HASH` flag with a valid hash name,
the `source:path` must point to a text file in the SUM format.

If you supply the `--one-way` flag, it will only check that files in
the source match the files in the destination, not the other way
around. This means that extra files in the destination that are not in
the source will not be detected.

The `--differ`, `--missing-on-dst`, `--missing-on-src`, `--match`
and `--error` flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or
stdout if it is `-`) supplied. What they write is described in the
help below. For example `--differ` will write all paths which are
present on both the source and destination but different.

The `--combined` flag will write a file (or stdout) which contains all
file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path to tell
you what happened to it. These are reminiscent of diff files.

- `= path` means path was found in source and destination and was identical
- `- path` means path was missing on the source, so only in the destination
- `+ path` means path was missing on the destination, so only in the source
- `* path` means path was present in source and destination but different.
- `! path` means there was an error reading or hashing the source or dest.

The default number of parallel checks is 8. See the [--checkers=N](/docs/#checkers-n)
option for more information.
