# rclone cat

Concatenates any files and sends them to stdout.

## Synopsis

Sends any files to standard output.

You can use it like this to output a single file

    rclone cat remote:path/to/file

Or like this to output any file in dir or its subdirectories.

    rclone cat remote:path/to/dir

Or like this to output any .txt files in dir or its subdirectories.

    rclone --include "*.txt" cat remote:path/to/dir

Use the `--head` flag to print characters only at the start, `--tail` for
the end and `--offset` and `--count` to print a section in the middle.
Note that if offset is negative it will count from the end, so
`--offset -1 --count 1` is equivalent to `--tail 1`.

Use the `--separator` flag to print a separator value between files. Be sure to
shell-escape special characters. For example, to print a newline between
files, use:

* bash:

      rclone --include "*.txt" --separator $'\n' cat remote:path/to/dir

* powershell:

      rclone --include "*.txt" --separator "`n" cat remote:path/to/dir


```
rclone cat remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --count int          Only print N characters (default -1)
      --discard            Discard the output instead of printing
      --head int           Only print the first N characters
  -h, --help               help for cat
      --offset int         Start printing at offset N (or from end if -ve)
      --separator string   Separator to use between objects when printing multiple files
      --tail int           Only print the last N characters
```

Options shared with other commands are described next.
