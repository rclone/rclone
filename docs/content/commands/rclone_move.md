# rclone move

Move files from source to dest.

## Synopsis


Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination
directory. Rclone will error if the source and destination overlap and
the remote does not support a server-side directory move operation.

To move single files, use the [moveto](/commands/rclone_moveto/)
command instead.

If no filters are in use and if possible this will server-side move
`source:path` into `dest:path`. After this `source:path` will no
longer exist.

Otherwise for each file in `source:path` selected by the filters (if
any) this will move it into `dest:path`.  If possible a server-side
move will be used, otherwise it will copy it (server-side if possible)
into `dest:path` then delete the original (if no errors on copy) in
`source:path`.

If you want to delete empty source directories after move, use the
`--delete-empty-src-dirs` flag.

See the [--no-traverse](/docs/#no-traverse) option for controlling
whether rclone lists the destination directory or not.  Supplying this
option when moving a small number of files into a large destination
can speed transfers up greatly.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.

**Note**: Use the `-P`/`--progress` flag to view real-time transfer statistics.
