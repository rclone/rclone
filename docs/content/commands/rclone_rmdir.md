# rclone rmdir

Remove the empty directory at path.

## Synopsis


This removes empty directory given by path. Will not remove the path if it
has any objects in it, not even empty subdirectories. Use
command [rmdirs](/commands/rclone_rmdirs/) (or [delete](/commands/rclone_delete/)
with option `--rmdirs`) to do that.

To delete a path and any objects in it, use [purge](/commands/rclone_purge/) command.


```
rclone rmdir remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for rmdir
```


## Important Options

```
  -n, --dry-run         Do a trial run with no permanent changes
  -i, --interactive     Enable interactive mode
  -v, --verbose count   Print lots more stuff (repeat for more)
```
