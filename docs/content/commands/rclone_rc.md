# rclone rc

Run a command against a running rclone.

## Synopsis



This runs a command against a running rclone.  Use the `--url` flag to
specify an non default URL to connect on.  This can be either a
":port" which is taken to mean "http://localhost:port" or a
"host:port" which is taken to mean "http://host:port"

A username and password can be passed in with `--user` and `--pass`.

Note that `--rc-addr`, `--rc-user`, `--rc-pass` will be read also for
`--url`, `--user`, `--pass`.

Arguments should be passed in as parameter=value.

The result will be returned as a JSON object by default.

The `--json` parameter can be used to pass in a JSON blob as an input
instead of key=value arguments.  This is the only way of passing in
more complicated values.

The `-o`/`--opt` option can be used to set a key "opt" with key, value
options in the form `-o key=value` or `-o key`. It can be repeated as
many times as required. This is useful for rc commands which take the
"opt" parameter which by convention is a dictionary of strings.

    -o key=value -o key2

Will place this in the "opt" value

    {"key":"value", "key2","")


The `-a`/`--arg` option can be used to set strings in the "arg" value. It
can be repeated as many times as required. This is useful for rc
commands which take the "arg" parameter which by convention is a list
of strings.

    -a value -a value2

Will place this in the "arg" value

    ["value", "value2"]

Use `--loopback` to connect to the rclone instance running `rclone rc`.
This is very useful for testing commands without having to run an
rclone rc server, e.g.:

    rclone rc --loopback operations/about fs=/

Use `rclone rc` to see a list of all possible commands.
