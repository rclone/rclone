# rclone rcd

Run rclone listening to remote control commands only.

## Synopsis


This runs rclone so that it only listens to remote control commands.

This is useful if you are controlling rclone via the rc API.

If you pass in a path to a directory, rclone will serve that directory
for GET requests on the URL passed in.  It will also open the URL in
the browser when rclone is run.

See the [rc documentation](/rc/) for more info on the rc flags.


```
rclone rcd <path to files to serve>* [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for rcd
```

See the [global flags page](/flags/) for global options not listed here.
