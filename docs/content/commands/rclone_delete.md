# rclone delete

Remove the files in path.

## Synopsis

Remove the files in path.  Unlike [purge](/commands/rclone_purge/) it
obeys include/exclude filters so can be used to selectively delete files.

`rclone delete` only deletes files but leaves the directory structure
alone. If you want to delete a directory and all of its contents use
the [purge](/commands/rclone_purge/) command.

If you supply the `--rmdirs` flag, it will remove all empty directories along with it.
You can also use the separate command [rmdir](/commands/rclone_rmdir/) or
[rmdirs](/commands/rclone_rmdirs/) to delete empty directories only.

For example, to delete all files bigger than 100 MiB, you may first want to
check what would be deleted (use either):

    rclone --min-size 100M lsl remote:path
    rclone --dry-run --min-size 100M delete remote:path

Then proceed with the actual delete:

    rclone --min-size 100M delete remote:path

That reads "delete everything with a minimum size of 100 MiB", hence
delete all files bigger than 100 MiB.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.


```
rclone delete remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help     help for delete
      --rmdirs   rmdirs removes empty directories but leaves root intact
```

Options shared with other commands are described next.
See the [global flags page](/flags/) for global options not listed here.

### Important Options

Important flags useful for most commands

```
  -n, --dry-run         Do a trial run with no permanent changes
  -i, --interactive     Enable interactive mode
  -v, --verbose count   Print lots more stuff (repeat for more)
```

### Filter Options

      --ignore-case                         Ignore case in filters (case insensitive)
      --include stringArray                 Include files matching pattern
      --include-from stringArray            Read file include patterns from file (use - to read from stdin)

```

### Listing Options

Flags for listing directories

      --fast-list           Use recursive list if available; uses more memory but fewer transactions
```
