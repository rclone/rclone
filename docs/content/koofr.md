# {{< icon "fa fa-suitcase" >}} Koofr

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for Koofr involves creating an application password for
rclone. You can do that by opening the Koofr
[web application](https://app.koofr.net/app/admin/preferences/password),
giving the password a nice name like `rclone` and clicking on generate.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `koofr`.  First run:

```sh
rclone config
```

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```text
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

You can choose to edit advanced config in order to enter your own service URL
if you use an on-premise or white label Koofr instance, or choose an alternative
mount instead of your primary storage.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Koofr

```sh
rclone lsd koofr:
```

List all the files in your Koofr

```sh
rclone ls koofr:
```

To copy a local directory to an Koofr directory called backup

```sh
rclone copy /home/source koofr:backup
```

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ï¼¼           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in XML strings.
