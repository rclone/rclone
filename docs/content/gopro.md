# GoPro Media Library

[GoPro Media Library](https://gopro.com/media-library/) is GoPro's cloud
storage for photos and video. GoPro doesn't publish an API for it - this
backend uses the one behind the gopro.com web app, as do several community
clients ([dustin/gopro-plus](https://github.com/dustin/gopro-plus),
[mvisonneau/gpcd](https://github.com/mvisonneau/gpcd),
[aricha/GoProcure](https://github.com/aricha/GoProcure),
[itsankoff/gopro-plus](https://github.com/itsankoff/gopro-plus)).
**GoPro can change or remove this API at any time without notice.**

Paths are specified as `remote:path`. The layout is virtual - see
[Directory layout](#directory-layout) - so most paths look like
`remote:media/all`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of making a remote for GoPro Media Library.

First run:

```console
rclone config
```

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```text
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

Enter name for new remote.
name> remote

Option Storage.
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.
XX / GoPro Media Library
   \ (gopro)
Storage> gopro

Option user.
GoPro account email.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
user> you@example.com

Option pass.
GoPro account password.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
y) Yes, type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No, leave this optional password blank
y/g/n> y
Enter the password:
password:
Confirm the password:
password:

Edit advanced config?
y/n> n

Keep this "remote" remote?
y/e/d> y
```

rclone stores a refresh token and renews the access token automatically.
If GoPro revokes the stored token, even while rclone is running (for
example in a mount), rclone logs in again with the stored
user name and password. If your account can't log in this way (for
example because of two-factor authentication), see
[`--gopro-access-token`](#gopro-access-token); such a token can't be
renewed and has to be replaced by hand when it expires.

Once configured you can use it like any other remote:

```console
rclone lsd remote:media
rclone copy remote:media/by-year/2026 /path/to/backup
rclone mount remote:media/all /mnt/gopro
```

## Directory layout

GoPro Media Library has no folders. This backend shows a virtual tree over
it, like the [Google Photos](/googlephotos/#layout) backend:

```text
media/
├── all/                       every media item, flat
├── by-year/YYYY/
├── by-month/YYYY/YYYY-MM/
└── by-day/YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD/
upload/                        files uploaded by this rclone process
```

The date directories are based on `captured_at` in UTC and only list
years, months and days that have media in them (see
[`--gopro-show-empty-dirs`](#gopro-show-empty-dirs)). The same item shows
up in `media/all` and in its date directories.

rclone recognises them as the same file by its ID, so moving a file to
another directory showing the same item, such as from `media/all` to
its own `by-day` directory, changes nothing.

Directories under `media/` can't be created or removed. Only `upload/`
accepts new files, and subdirectories can be made there to organise
them.

### Duplicate filenames

GoPro cameras reuse file names (`GX010123.MP4` turns up again and again),
so files are named `name {id}.ext`, where `id` is the GoPro media ID. With
[`--gopro-always-add-id=false`](#gopro-always-add-id) only names that
collide within a listing get the ID - but whether a name collides can
change as the library changes, and then `sync` sees a renamed file and
transfers it again.

### Chaptered videos, burst and time lapse photos

GoPro stores long recordings as several chapters, and burst or time lapse
photos as one item with many frames. Each is shown as its own file, named
`name-N.ext` (for example `GX010294-1.MP4`, `GX010294-2.MP4`). Time lapse
videos are ordinary single files.

GoPro only reports the total size of such an item, so each file's size
is shown as `-1` (unknown) rather than guessed. Set
[`--gopro-read-size`](#gopro-read-size) to read exact sizes (for example
for `rclone mount`), at the cost of one request per file.

### RAW photos

Photos shot in RAW mode have a RAW (`.gpr`) file next to the JPEG, and
both are listed under the same name, for example `GP012013 {id}.JPG` and
`GP012013 {id}.GPR` - for a photo series, one pair per frame.
[`--gopro-photo-format`](#gopro-photo-format) lists only the JPEG or only
the RAW file instead; a photo with only one of the two is always listed.

GoPro reports no size for RAW files, so their size is unknown unless
[`--gopro-read-size`](#gopro-read-size) is set. GoPro can only rename or
delete a photo together with its RAW file, so a RAW file can't be
renamed on its own, and deleting one follows
[`--gopro-delete-parts`](#gopro-delete-parts) - see
[Deleting files](#deleting-files).

A RAW file uploaded on its own keeps its `.gpr` name in GoPro, but GoPro
generates a JPEG for it once processed, so it's then listed as a pair
like any other RAW photo. In `upload/` it's still the uploaded RAW file.

### Highlights and Edits

Highlights generated by GoPro and Edits made in its app (`MultiClipEdit`
and `Edit` media) are listed by default, as in GoPro's own app - see
[`--gopro-include-edits`](#gopro-include-edits). The rendered video is
downloaded, and they're listed with an `.mp4` extension, added to their
whole name if it has another one (`Trip v1.5` is listed as
`Trip v1.5.mp4`). Auto-generated Highlights often have no name and are
listed as `{id}.mp4`. GoPro
reports no size for them, so their size is unknown unless
[`--gopro-read-size`](#gopro-read-size) is set.

### Size verification

The size GoPro reports for a file is occasionally a few KB off. That
fails rclone's integrity check, breaks multi-thread downloads and makes
`sync` transfer the file again on every run.
[`--gopro-verify-size`](#gopro-verify-size) checks sizes with an extra
request and logs a notice when one is wrong. By default only files GoPro
has reprocessed since upload are checked, as those are the only ones
seen affected.

## Modification times and hashes

The modification time is the item's `captured_at`, which is also what the
date directories are based on. `rclone touch` changes it, rewriting
GoPro's record of when the item was captured. The precision is reported
as unsupported, so `sync` and `copy` never change it on their own.

There is no hash, so `--checksum` can't be used and `sync` compares sizes
only.

## Which file gets downloaded

By default (`--gopro-download-variation source`) the original camera file
is downloaded, or the rendered video of a Highlight or Edit. Set
[`--gopro-download-variation`](#gopro-download-variation) to, for example,
`1080p` to download a smaller transcoded version instead. GoPro only
reports the size of the original, so sizes are then unknown unless
[`--gopro-read-size`](#gopro-read-size) is set.

## Renaming and moving files

Files under `media/` can be renamed and moved (`rclone moveto`,
`rclone move`). Moving a file to a different `by-year`, `by-month` or
`by-day` directory changes its `captured_at` to that date. A chapter or
burst frame can't be moved on its own.

GoPro uses the name as both the filename and the title shown in its app.
A move that keeps the name leaves both unchanged, and a file can't be
renamed to a name with nothing before its extension.

## Link sharing

`rclone link` creates a public share of a file at
`https://gopro.com/v/{id}`, titled with the file's name, or untitled for
media without a name (see [`--gopro-link-title`](#gopro-link-title)).
[`--gopro-link-allow-download`](#gopro-link-allow-download) lets
recipients download the original, which also shares any GPS data in it.
`--expire` and `--unlink` aren't supported: shares don't expire, and
there's no way to find the shares containing a file.

GoPro shares whole items, so `rclone link` refuses a single chapter or
frame, or the JPEG or RAW file of a RAW photo, which would share all the
others with it.
[`rclone backend link`](#link) shares whole items instead.

## Deleting files

By default deleted files go to GoPro's "Recently Deleted", where they
can be restored for 60 days (see
[`--gopro-trashed-only`](#gopro-trashed-only) and
[`rclone backend restore`](#restore)) and still count against the
storage quota. Set [`--gopro-use-trash=false`](#gopro-use-trash) to
delete permanently instead; GoPro takes about a minute to process that.
GoPro also applies an ordinary delete with a delay - typically around 15
seconds - so a listing straight after it may still show the file.

GoPro only deletes whole items: a chaptered video, a burst, continuous or
time lapse photo series, or a photo together with its RAW file. Its API
has no way to delete one chapter or frame - it ignores a part number
sent with a delete and deletes the whole item. Since rclone lists each
of these parts as its own file,
[`--gopro-delete-parts`](#gopro-delete-parts) decides what deleting one
of them does. By default none of them can be deleted, so a `move` or
`delete` fails for them and the item is kept - rclone deletes files one
at a time, even when deleting a whole directory, and can't tell GoPro
that all parts of an item are meant.
[`rclone backend delete`](#delete) deletes whole items instead.

## Uploading

Files are uploaded to `upload/` in chunks of
[`--gopro-upload-chunk-size`](#gopro-upload-chunk-size) (at least 5Mi),
with [`--gopro-upload-concurrency`](#gopro-upload-concurrency) in flight
at once. Chunk buffers count towards
[`--max-buffer-memory`](/docs/#max-buffer-memory). The size has to be
known up front, so `rclone rcat` stores the stream in a temporary file
first.

GoPro detects duplicates by their image content: a new upload that
matches an item already in the library is moved to "Recently Deleted"
by GoPro itself, a few seconds after the upload completes, even though
the upload succeeded. Changed metadata (for example the capture time) or
file name doesn't make it count as a different item.

GoPro can't replace a file's content, so overwriting a file in `upload/`
(for example in `rclone mount`) uploads a new item and, once GoPro has
processed it, deletes the old one, following `--gopro-use-trash`. If
GoPro drops the new upload as a duplicate or can't process it, the
overwrite fails and the old item is kept; if processing takes more than two minutes, the old
item is kept too and a notice logged. As there are no hashes or
modification times to compare, `rclone copy` only sees a changed file
if its size changed too - use `--ignore-times` to upload it anyway.

### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to gopro (GoPro Media Library).

#### --gopro-user

GoPro account email.

Leave blank if using access_token instead.

Properties:

- Config:      user
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_USER
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gopro-pass

GoPro account password.

Leave blank if using access_token instead.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](/commands/rclone_obscure/).

Properties:

- Config:      pass
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_PASS
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to gopro (GoPro Media Library).

#### --gopro-access-token

Static bearer token, as an alternative to user/pass.

Copy the value of the gp_access_token cookie from a browser session
logged into gopro.com/media-library. This does not refresh, so it
will stop working (typically within a few hours) and need pasting in
again - prefer user/pass unless your account can't complete that
flow.

Properties:

- Config:      access_token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_ACCESS_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gopro-download-variation

Which rendition to download.

"source" (the default) downloads the original camera file, or the
rendered video for Highlights and Edits. Any other value is matched
against the label or quality of the renditions GoPro offers (for
example "1080p" or "high_res_proxy_mp4"), falling back to the first
file offered if nothing matches. GoPro only reports the size of the
original, so any other rendition's size is unknown unless
[--gopro-read-size](#gopro-read-size) is set.

Properties:

- Config:      download_variation
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_DOWNLOAD_VARIATION
- Type:        string
- Default:     "source"

#### --gopro-include-edits

Include Highlights and user-made Edits in listings.

These "MultiClipEdit"/"Edit" media are rendered from other clips.
GoPro reports no size for them, so their size is unknown unless
[--gopro-read-size](#gopro-read-size) is set (e.g. for rclone mount).
The rendered video is downloaded and they are listed as ".mp4" -
unnamed auto-generated Highlights as "{id}.mp4".

Turn this off to list only camera originals.

Properties:

- Config:      include_edits
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_INCLUDE_EDITS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --gopro-include-processing

Include media GoPro hasn't finished processing yet.

By default only media in the "ready" state is listed. This adds the
"uploading", "registered", "transcoding" and "stabilizing" states.
Media in these states is often downloadable already, but items with no
file size yet are still skipped.

Properties:

- Config:      include_processing
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_INCLUDE_PROCESSING
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gopro-include-failed

Include media stuck in a "failure" or "unknown" state.

Such media may have no usable content. This is mainly useful to find
and remove stuck items.

Properties:

- Config:      include_failed
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_INCLUDE_FAILED
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gopro-show-all

List everything in the library, bypassing all filters.

This ignores [--gopro-include-edits](#gopro-include-edits),
[--gopro-include-processing](#gopro-include-processing) and
[--gopro-include-failed](#gopro-include-failed), and also lists
"export" media (internal renders GoPro's own app never shows). It can
surface media this backend doesn't know how to handle, so use it for
troubleshooting rather than normal browsing.

It has no effect with [--gopro-trashed-only](#gopro-trashed-only),
which always lists everything.

Properties:

- Config:      show_all
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_SHOW_ALL
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gopro-show-empty-dirs

Show every media/by-year, by-month and by-day directory.

By default only years, months and days with media in them are listed.
A path under an unlisted day can still be used as a move destination
either way - this only changes what is listed.

Properties:

- Config:      show_empty_dirs
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_SHOW_EMPTY_DIRS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gopro-start-year

Year to start media/by-year, by-month and by-day listings from.

0 (the default) uses the year of the earliest media in the library.
Set it together with [--gopro-show-empty-dirs](#gopro-show-empty-dirs)
to list earlier years.

Properties:

- Config:      start_year
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_START_YEAR
- Type:        int
- Default:     0

#### --gopro-link-allow-download

Allow downloading the original file from a public share link.

This is the "Allow Download" toggle in GoPro's web app. GoPro ties it
to sharing any GPS data embedded in the file, so enabling it shares
that location data with recipients too.

Properties:

- Config:      link_allow_download
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_LINK_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gopro-link-title

Title for public share links.

Defaults to the file's name without its {id} suffix, or no title for
media without a name. As "rclone link" can't pass a title, this applies
to every link created.

Properties:

- Config:      link_title
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_LINK_TITLE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gopro-use-trash

Send deleted files to GoPro's trash instead of deleting permanently.

Trashed media shows as "Recently Deleted" in GoPro's app, can be
restored for up to 60 days (see "rclone backend restore" and
[--gopro-trashed-only](#gopro-trashed-only)) and still counts against
the storage quota. Media from GoPro cameras doesn't count against any
quota, so there's nothing to gain by skipping the trash for it.

Properties:

- Config:      use_trash
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_USE_TRASH
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --gopro-trashed-only

Only show media in GoPro's trash.

With this set, every listing under media/ shows "Recently Deleted"
instead of the active library, including items the other filters would
hide. Deleting a file here removes it permanently, regardless of
[--gopro-use-trash](#gopro-use-trash). Use "rclone backend restore" to
move it back to the library.

To view the trash next to the normal library, override this per
command, e.g. "gopro,trashed_only=true:media/all".

Properties:

- Config:      trashed_only
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_TRASHED_ONLY
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gopro-always-add-id

Always add the media ID to file names, as "name {id}.ext".

GoPro cameras reuse file names, so names that collide within a listing
always get the ID. Without this option whether a file collides can
change from one run to the next, renaming it - sync then deletes and
re-transfers it. Only turn this off for a library without duplicate
names.

Properties:

- Config:      always_add_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_ALWAYS_ADD_ID
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --gopro-verify-size

Verify file sizes with a HEAD request before relying on them.

The size GoPro reports can be wrong, which fails rclone's integrity
check and makes sync re-transfer the file on every run. The only files
seen affected had been reprocessed by GoPro after upload, so by default
only those are checked.

Properties:

- Config:      verify_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_VERIFY_SIZE
- Type:        string
- Default:     "reprocessed"
- Examples:
  - "reprocessed"
    - Verify only files GoPro has reprocessed since upload
  - "always"
    - Verify every file - safest, one extra request per file
  - "off"
    - Never verify - fastest, trusts file_size from the API as-is

#### --gopro-photo-format

Which files to list for photos shot with both JPEG and RAW.

A photo shot in RAW mode has a RAW (.gpr) file next to its JPEG, listed
under the same name. A photo with only one of the two is always listed,
whatever this is set to.

Properties:

- Config:      photo_format
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_PHOTO_FORMAT
- Type:        string
- Default:     "both"
- Examples:
  - "both"
    - List both the JPEG and the RAW file
  - "jpeg"
    - List only the JPEG
  - "raw"
    - List only the RAW file

#### --gopro-delete-parts

How to delete a single chapter, frame or RAW file.

GoPro only deletes whole items: a chaptered video, a burst, continuous
or time lapse photo series, or a photo together with its RAW file.
Deleting just one of the files rclone lists for such an item would
delete all of them.

By default none of these files can be deleted on its own, so deleting
or moving one fails and the item is kept. Delete whole items with
"rclone backend delete" instead.

The other modes delete the whole item, so use them with care: rclone
deletes each file on its own, for example straight after moving it to
another remote, so the item's other files are deleted with it even if
they were never transferred.

Properties:

- Config:      delete_parts
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_DELETE_PARTS
- Type:        string
- Default:     "refuse"
- Examples:
  - "refuse"
    - No file of such an item can be deleted on its own - use "rclone backend delete"
  - "first"
    - Deleting the item's first file (chapter or frame 1, or the JPEG of a RAW photo) deletes the whole item
  - "any"
    - Deleting any file of the item deletes the whole item

#### --gopro-read-size

Read the exact size of chaptered videos, burst photos and edits.

GoPro only reports the total size of a chaptered video or burst photo
set, and none for Highlights and Edits, so their size is unknown by
default. Set this if you need exact sizes, e.g. for rclone mount. This
costs one extra request per file.

Properties:

- Config:      read_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_READ_SIZE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gopro-upload-chunk-size

Chunk size for uploads to the upload/ directory.

Must be at least 5Mi: GoPro's upload endpoint is S3-backed and rejects
anything smaller for every part but the last.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_UPLOAD_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     6Mi

#### --gopro-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

GoPro's chunk upload protocol accepts parts in any order, so chunks of
a single file are PUT concurrently once read. Note that chunks are
buffered in memory, so total memory use can be up to
upload_chunk_size * upload_concurrency.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     4

#### --gopro-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,CrLf,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --gopro-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

## Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the gopro backend.

Run them with:

```console
rclone backend COMMAND remote:
```

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the [backend](/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](/rc/#backend-command).

### restore

Restore media from GoPro's trash

```console
rclone backend restore remote: [options] [<arguments>+]
```

This restores media from GoPro's trash to the active library,
whether or not --gopro-trashed-only is set.

With no arguments, it restores everything in the trash:

    rclone backend restore gopro:

Otherwise each argument names one medium to restore, either by its id
or by its "name {id}.ext" file name as listed with --gopro-trashed-only:

    rclone backend restore gopro: 6a99f18a239bf36f4c2377cf "photo {6a99f18a239bf36f4c2377cf}.jpg"

With --dry-run, it only logs what would be restored.

GoPro restores asynchronously and reports no failures, so a restored
item can take a while to reappear in the library, and occasionally
doesn't at all. Check with --gopro-trashed-only if one is missing.

### delete

Delete whole media, with all their files

```console
rclone backend delete remote: [options] [<arguments>+]
```

This deletes whole media, including every chapter, frame and RAW
file of each, following --gopro-use-trash. See --gopro-delete-parts for
why deleting one of those files on its own may not be possible.

Each argument names one medium, either by its id or by the name of any
of its files as listed by this backend:

    rclone backend delete gopro: 6a29a4bcfe314c5af39cfcbe "GX012010-2 {6a29a4bcfe314c5af39cfcbe}.MP4"

With --dry-run, it only logs what would be deleted.

### link

Create public share links for whole media

```console
rclone backend link remote: [options] [<arguments>+]
```

This creates a public share link for each medium named, following
--gopro-link-title and --gopro-link-allow-download, and prints the links.

GoPro shares whole media, so "rclone link" refuses a single chapter or
frame, or the JPEG or RAW file of a RAW photo - this shares every file
of the medium instead. Each
argument names one medium, either by its id or by the name of any of its
files as listed by this backend:

    rclone backend link gopro: "GX012010-2 {6a29a4bcfe314c5af39cfcbe}.MP4"

With --dry-run, it only logs what would be shared.

<!-- autogenerated options stop -->

## Limitations

- `Copy` and `DirMove` aren't supported: GoPro has no server-side copy,
  and the directories are virtual.
- Multi-item media has only been tested with `Video`, `Burst`,
  `Continuous` and `TimeLapse` items. Other types may not download
  correctly.
- Albums, moments and sidecar files other than RAW photos (such as
  GPS/telemetry) aren't shown.
- `upload/` only lists files uploaded by the running rclone process;
  uploaded files appear under `media/` once GoPro has processed them.
