# GoPro Media Library

[GoPro Media Library](https://gopro.com/media-library/) is GoPro's cloud
storage for photos and video. GoPro does not publish an API for it: this
backend is built by reverse engineering the gopro.com web app,
cross-checked against several community clients
([dustin/gopro-plus](https://github.com/dustin/gopro-plus),
[mvisonneau/gpcd](https://github.com/mvisonneau/gpcd),
[aricha/GoProcure](https://github.com/aricha/GoProcure),
[itsankoff/gopro-plus](https://github.com/itsankoff/gopro-plus)) and
verified against a live account. **GoPro can change or remove this API at
any time without notice** - if this backend suddenly stops working, that is
likely why.

Paths are specified as `remote:path`. The layout is virtual (see
[Directory layout](#directory-layout) below) rather than a container/path
scheme, so most paths will just be `remote:media/all` or similar.

## Configuration

Here is an example of making a remote for GoPro Media Library.

First run:

```console
rclone config
```

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```text
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

Enter name for new remote.
name> remote

Option Storage.
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.
XX / GoPro Media Library
   \ (gopro)
Storage> gopro

Option user.
GoPro account email.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
user> you@example.com

Option pass.
GoPro account password.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
y) Yes, type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No, leave this optional password blank
y/g/n> y
Enter the password:
password:
Confirm the password:
password:

Edit advanced config?
y/n> n

Keep this "remote" remote?
y/e/d> y
```

This runs a standard OAuth2 password grant against GoPro's own token
endpoint and stores a refresh token, so it does not need to be repeated -
`rclone` will renew the access token automatically. If GoPro rejects that
refresh outright (confirmed live: a stored token can end up blacklisted
server-side, not just expired), this backend automatically falls back to
running the same password grant again using the stored username/password,
the same recovery `rclone config reconnect` performs manually, so a normal
command self-heals instead of failing until someone runs that by hand. If
your account can't complete the password grant at all (for example because
it requires interactive 2FA that this flow doesn't support), see
[`--gopro-access-token`](#gopro-access-token) for a fallback - static
tokens have no refresh or recovery of any kind, so expect to paste in a new
one by hand periodically.

Once configured you can use it like any other remote:

```console
rclone lsd remote:media
rclone copy remote:media/by-year/2026 /path/to/backup
rclone mount remote:media/all /mnt/gopro
```

## Directory layout

GoPro Media Library has no folders of its own - it's a flat, ID-keyed library.
This backend presents a virtual directory tree over it, in the same style
as the [Google Photos](/googlephotos/#layout) backend:

```text
media/
├── all/                       every ready media item, flat
├── by-year/YYYY/
├── by-month/YYYY/YYYY-MM/
└── by-day/YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD/
upload/                        files rclone has uploaded this run
```

`by-year`/`by-month`/`by-day` are filtered by `captured_at`, in UTC - not
the timezone the camera recorded in, since the API gives no way to filter
on that. `media/all` and the date-filtered views all show the same
underlying items; nothing needs to be uploaded more than once to appear in
more than one of them.

None of these directories can be created, renamed or removed - `rclone
mkdir`/`rmdir` on anything under `media/` fails, since they already exist
whenever there is a matching pattern and there's nothing real underneath to
delete. Only `upload/` accepts new files, and only `upload/` supports
`mkdir`/`rmdir` for organising them into subdirectories.

### Duplicate filenames

GoPro cameras recycle filenames constantly (`GX010123.MP4` turns up over
and over across different recording sessions). Whenever a directory listing
contains two items with the same name, both are renamed to
`name {id}.ext`, where `id` is the item's GoPro media ID. This mirrors how
the Google Photos backend handles the same problem.

By default ([`--gopro-always-add-id`](#gopro-always-add-id)) every file
gets this treatment, not just ones actually colliding in a given listing.
Whether a particular file collides depends on what else happens to exist
in the library at listing time, which isn't stable from one run to the
next - a file uploaded today as `GX010123.MP4` can silently become
`GX010123 {id}.MP4` the moment some unrelated second `GX010123.MP4` turns
up elsewhere, with nothing about the original file itself having changed.
rclone has no way to know the old and new names are the same file, so
`sync` would delete and re-transfer it, and `copy` would leave a stale
duplicate behind under the old name, forever. Always including the ID
makes a file's name a stable function of the file itself, not of whatever
else happens to be in the library that day. Turn this off for cleaner
names if the library is small/static enough that a same-name collision is
not a realistic concern.

### Chaptered videos and burst photos

A single library entry can be made of several files: GoPro splits a long
continuous recording into numbered chapters, and a burst photo shoot is
stored as one entry with dozens (sometimes 100+) of numbered frames. This
backend exposes each one as a separate file, named `name-N.ext` (for
example `GX010294-1.MP4`, `GX010294-2.MP4`).

Because the size reported by the API for a multi-item entry is the *total*
across every item, not any one item's size, `rclone size` and `rclone
ls`/`lsl` show `-1` (unknown) for these files by default rather than a
guess - an inaccurate guess would make rclone's own transfer integrity
check fail on every download. Set
[`--gopro-read-size`](#gopro-read-size) if you need exact sizes for these
(for example for `rclone mount`), at the cost of one extra request per
file.

### Highlights and Edits

GoPro-generated Highlight reels and user-made Edits (`MultiClipEdit`
and `Edit` media types) are composed from other clips rather than being
their own camera-original recording. They're included by default,
matching what GoPro's own web/app library shows - see
[`--gopro-include-edits`](#gopro-include-edits) to exclude them.

These behave differently enough from ordinary media to be worth calling
out even once included: their own `file_extension` is that of an
internal Edit Decision List (typically `json`), not of what actually
gets downloaded - GoPro serves the rendered video (a `baked_source`
rendition) for these, never the EDL, and this backend's reported
Content-Type follows the filename's own extension (usually `.mp4`)
rather than `file_extension`, to match what's actually served. Their
`file_size` is always null, reported the same way as the multi-item
files above (`-1`, unknown, resolved on demand via
[`--gopro-read-size`](#gopro-read-size)) rather than skipped.

### Size verification

The `file_size` GoPro's API reports for a media item can be wrong - seen
live, a few KB larger than the size its "source" rendition actually
serves. This isn't just cosmetic: `rclone copy`'s multi-thread downloader
divides a file into ranged chunks using the size known *before* the
download starts, so a too-large size makes it request a chunk that runs
past the real end of the file and fails the whole transfer (`failed to
write chunk: expected ... but wrote ...`); and a sync that only ever saw
the stale size would re-download an already-correct file on every single
run, forever, since the sizes would never match.

[`--gopro-verify-size`](#gopro-verify-size) controls which files get
checked against a live response before relying on their size, correcting
and logging a `NOTICE`-level warning whenever one is wrong (the file is
still downloaded either way - the size actually served is trustworthy).
By default this only checks files GoPro has reprocessed since upload,
the one thing a live account probe found in common with the one affected
file out of hundreds checked - colder storage alone isn't enough, most
archived files still report correctly. Set it to `always` for the
strongest guarantee at the cost of one extra request per file, or `off`
to skip the check entirely and trust `file_size` as-is. Either way this
is on top of what [`--gopro-read-size`](#gopro-read-size) already costs
for a multi-item file.

## Modification times and hashes

GoPro Media Library reports a `captured_at` timestamp for every item,
which this backend uses as the modification time. Confirmed live, this
isn't actually fixed at upload time the way most backends' equivalent is
- `PUT /media/{id}` can change it - so `SetModTime` is implemented
(`rclone touch` and similar work). This changes GoPro's own record of
when the medium was captured, not just a local label, so treat it
accordingly.

That said, this backend still reports its modtime precision as
unsupported, deliberately: `rclone sync`/`copy` don't use modification
time to decide what needs transferring here, so an ordinary sync run
never calls `SetModTime` as a side effect and won't silently rewrite
capture dates just because a local file's timestamp doesn't exactly
match. It's only invoked when something asks for it directly - `rclone
touch`, or a `Move` across a `by-year`/`by-month`/`by-day` boundary (see
"Renaming and moving files" below).

There is no supported hash algorithm, so `--checksum` cannot be used;
`rclone sync` falls back to comparing size alone, which for the
multi-item files described above means it's unavailable unless
`--gopro-read-size` is set.

## Which file gets downloaded

`_embedded.files[]` in GoPro's API is a transcoded proxy, not the camera
original - confirmed on a real account, where it resolved to a 1080p
rendition of a video actually shot in 4K. By default
(`--gopro-download-variation source`) this backend instead downloads the
rendition labelled `"source"`, which is the true original. Set
`--gopro-download-variation` to something else (for example `1080p`, or a
proxy label like `high_res_proxy_mp4`) to download a transcoded rendition
instead, if you want smaller/faster transfers and don't need the original.

## Renaming and moving files

`Move` is implemented (`rclone moveto`, and `rclone move`/`sync` for
files that already exist at the destination under a different name) -
confirmed live, a medium's filename isn't fixed after upload the way it
is on most backends: `PUT /media/{id}` renames it in place.

Moving within `media/all`, or within the same `by-year`/`by-month`/`by-day`
bucket, only renames the file. Moving across a `by-year`, `by-month` or
`by-day` boundary (for example `media/by-day/2026/2026-08-28/x.mp4` to
`media/by-day/2026/2026-08-29/x.mp4`) also changes `captured_at` to match
the destination date, since those directories are views computed from it
- this is the one way a move can actually reposition a file between them,
not just cosmetic, so treat it with the same care as
[`SetModTime`](#modification-times-and-hashes) above. A multi-item file
(a chaptered video or burst photo set item) can't be moved individually -
the API renames the whole medium, not one chapter or frame of it.

`Copy` and `DirMove` remain unimplemented - see "Limitations" below.

## Link sharing

`PublicLink` is implemented (`rclone link remote:path`), creating a
public share that needs no authentication to view or download from -
confirmed live with a fresh upload and a plain unauthenticated request
against the returned URL. GoPro calls the underlying object a
"collection" internally; this backend always creates one holding just
the single file being shared, and the link is
`https://gopro.com/v/{collection-id}`.

The link's title defaults to the file's own name (with this backend's
own `{id}` disambiguation suffix stripped, since that's never meant to
be shown outside this backend) - set
[`--gopro-link-title`](#gopro-link-title) for a custom one; `rclone
link` itself has no way to pass a one-off title per call, so this
applies for the remote's lifetime, not just the next link created.
[`--gopro-link-allow-download`](#gopro-link-allow-download) controls
whether the link also allows downloading the original file and sharing
any GPS data embedded in it - off by default; GoPro's API has one
field for both, confirmed against its own web UI, so they can't be set
independently.

`--expire` and `--unlink` are not supported and are silently ignored,
per this command's own documented behaviour for backends that can't:
GoPro's collections API exposes no expiry field, so links don't expire,
and a medium can be referenced by any number of independent shares with
no way to look up which ones from the medium's own record, so there's
no single reliable "the" link to remove on request.

## Deleting files

By default, `rclone delete`/`rclone rmdir`/removing a file during
`rclone sync` doesn't actually make GoPro forget about it - confirmed
live, GoPro moves it to what its own web/app UI calls "Recently
Deleted" instead. It's recoverable there for up to 60 days, and still
counts against your storage quota, even though every listing and
`NewObject` lookup this backend does already correctly treats it as
gone. Set [`--gopro-use-trash=false`](#gopro-use-trash) to skip that
and delete permanently instead - confirmed live, this still takes
GoPro roughly a minute to actually process in the background, not
instant, but it's gone for good once it does, unlike the 60-day
recoverable default.

## Uploading

Files uploaded to `upload/` are always sent in chunks (there's no
single-shot upload endpoint), read from the source in order but PUT to
GoPro concurrently - `--gopro-upload-concurrency` chunks in flight at
once, `--gopro-upload-chunk-size` bytes each. GoPro's chunk upload
accepts parts in any order, so this is safe; it mainly speeds up large
single-file uploads, since each chunk is a separate HTTP round trip.
`--gopro-upload-chunk-size` can't go below 5Mi: GoPro's upload endpoint
is S3-backed and enforces that as the minimum part size (except for the
last part of a file). `PutStream` isn't supported - the protocol needs
the file size before the first chunk is requested.

Chunk buffers come from rclone's shared memory pool rather than being
allocated per chunk, so an upload's buffer memory is subject to
[`--max-buffer-memory`](/docs/#max-buffer-memory) and
[`--use-mmap`](/docs/#use-mmap) like any other chunked-upload backend's.

### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to gopro (GoPro Media Library).

#### --gopro-user

GoPro account email.

Leave blank if using access_token instead.

Properties:

- Config:      user
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_USER
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gopro-pass

GoPro account password.

Leave blank if using access_token instead.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](/commands/rclone_obscure/).

Properties:

- Config:      pass
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_PASS
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to gopro (GoPro Media Library).

#### --gopro-access-token

Static bearer token, as an alternative to user/pass.

Copy the value of the gp_access_token cookie from a browser session
logged into gopro.com/media-library. This does not refresh, so it
will stop working (typically within a few hours) and need pasting in
again - prefer user/pass unless your account can't complete that
flow.

Properties:

- Config:      access_token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_ACCESS_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gopro-download-variation

Which rendition to download.

"source" (the default) downloads the original camera file. Any other
value is matched against the label or quality of the renditions GoPro
offers for that media item (for example "1080p", or a proxy label such
as "high_res_proxy_mp4"); if no match is found the backend falls back
to the first file offered.

Properties:

- Config:      download_variation
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_DOWNLOAD_VARIATION
- Type:        string
- Default:     "source"

#### --gopro-include-edits

Include Highlights and user-made Edits in listings.

On by default, matching what GoPro's own web/app library shows. These
"MultiClipEdit"/"Edit" media are composed from other clips rather than
being their own camera-original recording, and behave differently
enough that it's worth knowing what this backend already does about
it before turning this off:

- file_size is always null for these - this backend reports their
  size as unknown (like a chaptered video or burst photo set) rather
  than skipping them, so [--gopro-read-size](#gopro-read-size) is
  needed for an exact size (e.g. for rclone mount).
- Their own file_extension is that of an internal Edit Decision List
  (typically "json"), not of what's actually downloaded - GoPro
  serves the rendered video (the "baked_source" rendition) for these,
  not the EDL, and this backend's Content-Type follows the filename's
  own extension (usually ".mp4") to match what's actually served.

Turn this off if you only want camera-original recordings, or to skip
what's often a redundant rendering of content the library already has
natively.

Properties:

- Config:      include_edits
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_INCLUDE_EDITS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --gopro-include-processing

Include media GoPro hasn't finished processing yet.

Off by default: only media with ready_to_view "ready" is listed, since
that's the only state GoPro's own API documents as done. Turning this
on also includes "uploading", "registered", "transcoding" and
"stabilizing" - every state on the way to "ready" - but not "failure"
or "unknown", which aren't on the way to anything.

Confirmed live: a medium already has its file_size (and, in that one
confirmed case, its camera-original file) available while
"transcoding", not just once "ready" - "ready" mainly means every
extra rendition (proxies, thumbnails) GoPro generates is also done,
not that the medium is otherwise unusable before then. That's not
confirmed for every state this option adds, though - a medium with no
usable file_size yet (still true for at least "uploading" and
"registered", most of the time) is still skipped by the same check
that already skips one with file_size null for any other reason, so
turning this on surfaces whatever's actually downloadable while still
processing, not a guarantee that every added state has something to
show.

Properties:

- Config:      include_processing
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_INCLUDE_PROCESSING
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gopro-include-failed

Include media stuck in a "failure" or "unknown" ready_to_view state.

Off by default, and separate from --gopro-include-processing: unlike
that option's states, these two aren't on the way to "ready" - they're
what a medium ends up in instead, and there's no live-confirmed
guarantee either one has a usable file_size or rendition to serve.
Mainly useful to see that something is stuck at all (e.g. to remove
it) rather than to actually read its content, which may well not be
there.

Properties:

- Config:      include_failed
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_INCLUDE_FAILED
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gopro-show-all

Bypass every type/composition/processing filter this backend applies
to the active library.

Off by default. With this on, /media/search is listed exactly as
returned, with none of --gopro-include-edits,
--gopro-include-processing, --gopro-include-failed, or the
unconditional exclusion of "export" composition media (internal
rendered artifacts, not user content) applied - every one of those
becomes irrelevant while this is on, active or not.

This only affects the active library - a trashed listing under
[--gopro-trashed-only](#gopro-trashed-only) already shows everything
unconditionally, with or without this set.

This is a raw escape hatch, not a normal browsing mode: it can surface
media types, compositions or processing states this backend has never
been tested against, and nothing guarantees rclone can make sense of
what comes back - at best a file with no usable size or rendition
(already handled the same way an Edit's null file_size is elsewhere),
at worst a confusing failure partway through a listing, download or
sync. Turn this on to see something --gopro-include-processing and
--gopro-include-failed still don't cover, not as a default way to
browse the library.

Properties:

- Config:      show_all
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_SHOW_ALL
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gopro-show-empty-dirs

Show every media/by-year, by-month and by-day directory, not just
the ones with something in them.

Off by default: media/by-year, media/by-month and media/by-day only
list years/months/days with at least one included item captured in
them - cheap to check now that the whole library is cached (see
--gopro-start-year), and considerably less noisy than the fixed
1-year-to-today range this backend used to always show regardless of
content.

Turn this on to get that full range back - mainly for scripts that
rely on a specific by-day directory always being addressable to move
or upload a file into it (setting its captured_at in the process, as
this backend's Move already does) even before anything is captured on
that day: with this off, a day with nothing in it doesn't appear in a
listing, but a path under it is still a perfectly valid destination to
move or upload to directly, exactly as before - this only changes what
shows up when listing, not what's addressable.

Properties:

- Config:      show_empty_dirs
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_SHOW_EMPTY_DIRS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gopro-start-year

Year to start media/by-year, by-month and by-day listings from.

0 (the default) auto-detects it from the library's own earliest
captured_at year, refreshed whenever the cached listing is (see
--gopro-show-empty-dirs's mention of caching) - which is also, on its
own, almost exactly what --gopro-show-empty-dirs=false already narrows
the range down to. Set this explicitly to widen the range on purpose
regardless of content - together with --gopro-show-empty-dirs=true, to
address a specific day before this account has anything in it at all,
for example one before its own earliest media.

Properties:

- Config:      start_year
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_START_YEAR
- Type:        int
- Default:     0

#### --gopro-link-allow-download

Allow downloading the original file from a public share link.

Off by default. Confirmed live against GoPro's own web UI: this is
its "Allow Download" toggle when creating a share link, and enabling
it does two things at once, not just one - per that UI's own warning
text, if the shared file has embedded GPS data, that gets shared with
recipients too, not just download access. GoPro's API has one field
for both; there is no way to control them separately.

Turn this on if you want recipients to be able to download the
original file, and are fine with any embedded location data going
out with it.

Properties:

- Config:      link_allow_download
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_LINK_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gopro-link-title

Title for a public share link.

Defaults to the file's own name (its --gopro-always-add-id {id}
suffix stripped, since that's never meant to be shown outside this
backend) if left blank - rclone's own "rclone link" command has no
way to pass a one-off title per call, so this is the only way to set
one, and it applies to every link this backend creates for the
remote's lifetime, not just the next one.

Properties:

- Config:      link_title
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_LINK_TITLE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gopro-use-trash

Send deleted files to GoPro's own trash instead of deleting permanently.

Confirmed live: without "permanent=true" on the delete request,
GoPro only moves a medium to what its own UI calls "Recently
Deleted" - it's not actually gone, remains recoverable there for up
to 60 days (rclone backend restore, or GoPro's own web/app UI, can
bring it back - see [--gopro-trashed-only](#gopro-trashed-only)),
and still counts against your storage quota even while it sits
there, even though every listing this backend does (and the
medium's own record) already correctly treats it as absent.

Defaults to true, matching the drive backend's --drive-use-trash and
GoPro's own web/app default ("delete" there is also recoverable) -
safer than a mistaken or scripted delete being unrecoverable by
default. Set to false to skip the trash and delete permanently
instead - matches what "rclone delete" usually means on backends
without a trash concept at all. This costs nothing extra for
GoPro-branded camera media specifically: it's "exempt" from any
storage quota ("Unlimited Storage" in the account dashboard), so
there's no space to reclaim by skipping the trash either way.
Anything uploaded here that isn't GoPro-camera footage is
"non_exempt" and capped instead ("Additional Storage: x/100GB" in
the dashboard) - for that content, turning this off still trades a
recoverable delete for an immediately-final one.

Properties:

- Config:      use_trash
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_USE_TRASH
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --gopro-trashed-only

Only show media in GoPro's trash in listings, for restoring it.

Matches the drive backend's --drive-trashed-only: with this on, every
listing under media/ shows what's currently in GoPro's "Recently
Deleted" (see [--gopro-use-trash](#gopro-use-trash)) instead of the
active library, so it can be inspected or copied out before GoPro
auto-purges it (confirmed live, roughly 60 days after deletion).

GET /media/deleted (what this reads from) doesn't support the same
server-side type or date-range filtering /media/search does -
confirmed live, it always returns the entire trash regardless of
these parameters - so this backend fetches the whole trash to narrow
down even a single media/by-year, media/by-month or media/by-day
listing. That fetch is cached in memory for a few minutes, so only the
first trashed listing in a given run pays for it - the rest, however
many different by-year/by-month/by-day views they ask for, are free.

Every trashed item is shown, regardless of
[--gopro-include-edits](#gopro-include-edits),
[--gopro-include-processing](#gopro-include-processing),
[--gopro-include-failed](#gopro-include-failed) or an unusable
file_size - matching GoPro's own web/app "Recently Deleted" view, which
applies none of its own library's filters either. The only things you
can do with a trashed item are restore it or delete it for good, so
there's no browsing-safety reason to hide any of it the way this
backend hides an unfinished or unrecognised item from the active
library by default.

This changes what every listing shows, not just one path - use an
on-the-fly connection string (e.g. ":gopro,trashed_only=true:media/all")
rather than setting it globally in the remote's config if a normal,
non-trashed view of the same remote is still needed side by side. To
restore trashed media back to the active library, see "rclone backend
restore".

Deleting a file shown here (e.g. via "rclone delete") always purges it
permanently, regardless of --gopro-use-trash - confirmed live, GoPro's
API rejects a second ordinary delete on a medium that's already in the
trash, so there is nothing "soft" left to do to it.

Properties:

- Config:      trashed_only
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_TRASHED_ONLY
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gopro-always-add-id

Always name files "name {id}.ext" instead of just "name.ext".

Without this, a file only gets its GoPro media ID appended to its name
when it collides with another file of the same name in the same
listing - but GoPro cameras recycle filenames constantly, so whether a
given file collides depends on what else happens to exist at listing
time, which can change from one run to the next with no change to the
file itself. That makes a plain name unstable: a file uploaded earlier
under "GX010123.MP4" can silently become "GX010123 {id}.MP4" the
moment a second "GX010123.MP4" turns up elsewhere in the library, and
rclone has no way to know the two names refer to the same file -
"sync" would delete and re-transfer it under the new name, and "copy"
would leave a stale duplicate behind under the old one, forever.

On by default because that failure mode is silent and only shows up
intermittently, on whichever run happens to introduce a colliding
name - a normal-looking successful sync/copy today doesn't mean this
won't bite on some future run. Turn it off only if you want clean
names and are confident this library won't hit a same-name collision
(a small, static library of hand-picked clips, say), or don't mind the
occasional renamed-and-re-transferred file.

Properties:

- Config:      always_add_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_ALWAYS_ADD_ID
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --gopro-verify-size

Verify a file's size with a live request before relying on it.

file_size from the search API can be wrong - confirmed live, a few KB
larger than the size actually served, specifically for a video whose
"source" rendition had been moved to colder S3 storage. A wrong size
here does more than look odd: it fails rclone's post-transfer
integrity check (discarding an otherwise-complete download and
restarting it), can corrupt rclone's multi-thread downloader (which
divides a file into ranged chunks using this size before the transfer
starts), and makes "sync" re-download an already-correct file on every
single run, since the sizes would never match.

GoPro's API exposes no storage class or anything else that reliably
predicts which files are affected - checked live, colder storage alone
isn't enough, most files there still report their size correctly. The
one thing a live account probe did find in common with the one
affected file, out of hundreds checked, is that GoPro had reprocessed
it after upload (a non-null reprocessed_at). That's a single data
point, not a proven rule, but it's free to check - the same listing
already fetches it - so it's the default: cheaper than checking every
file, safer than checking none.

Properties:

- Config:      verify_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_VERIFY_SIZE
- Type:        string
- Default:     "reprocessed"
- Examples:
  - "reprocessed"
    - Verify only files GoPro has reprocessed since upload
  - "always"
    - Verify every file - safest, one extra request per file
  - "off"
    - Never verify - fastest, trusts file_size from the API as-is

#### --gopro-read-size

Read the exact size of a chaptered video or burst photo set item.

file_size from the search API is only the total across every item of a
chaptered video or burst photo set, not any single one, so an
individual item's size is normally left unknown (-1) rather than
guessed at by dividing it evenly. Set this if you need an exact size
for one of these, for example for rclone mount. This does one extra
request per file, on top of what --gopro-verify-size already costs -
so listing a large library with lots of chaptered/burst items will be
slower still.

Properties:

- Config:      read_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_READ_SIZE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gopro-upload-chunk-size

Chunk size for uploads to the upload/ directory.

Must be at least 5Mi: GoPro's upload endpoint is S3-backed and rejects
anything smaller for every part but the last.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_UPLOAD_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     6Mi

#### --gopro-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

GoPro's chunk upload protocol accepts parts in any order, so chunks of
a single file are PUT concurrently once read. Note that chunks are
buffered in memory, so total memory use can be up to
upload_chunk_size * upload_concurrency.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     4

#### --gopro-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,CrLf,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --gopro-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOPRO_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

## Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the gopro backend.

Run them with:

```console
rclone backend COMMAND remote:
```

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the [backend](/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](/rc/#backend-command).

### restore

Restore media from GoPro's trash

```console
rclone backend restore remote: [options] [<arguments>+]
```

This restores media out of GoPro's trash and back into the active
library - confirmed live, undocumented API. It always operates on the
trash regardless of --gopro-trashed-only, since there would otherwise be
no way to run it without reconfiguring the remote first.

With no arguments, it restores everything currently in the trash:

    rclone backend restore gopro:

Given one or more arguments, each one names a single medium to restore
instead - either a bare id, or a trashed listing's own "name {id}.ext"
leaf (see --gopro-trashed-only and --gopro-always-add-id) pasted straight
from "rclone lsf":

    rclone backend restore gopro: 6a99f18a239bf36f4c2377cf "photo {6a99f18a239bf36f4c2377cf}.jpg"

Nothing is restored if --dry-run is set; the command logs what would be
restored instead.

GoPro's API accepts the request (202 Accepted) before actually
restoring anything - confirmed live, this backend's own cache is
updated straight away, but GoPro's side can lag behind that, and for a
handful of media that had sat in trash across several sessions it
never completed at all even minutes later and after being retried,
with no error to explain why. Re-check with --gopro-trashed-only if a
restored item doesn't show up in the active library right away.

## Limitations

- No `ListR`: the directory tree above is several overlapping views of the
  same flat media list, so a full recursive listing wouldn't be any faster
  than rclone's default directory-by-directory walk.
- `Copy` and `DirMove` aren't implemented: GoPro Media Library has no
  server-side copy operation to build `Copy` on, and `DirMove` has nothing
  real to rename - every directory in the tree above is synthetic. `Move`
  is implemented; see "Renaming and moving files" below.
- Only `Video` and `Burst` media have been confirmed to use the two
  chapter/burst addressing schemes described above; other multi-item types
  (`TimeLapse`, `Continuous`, ...) may follow either one.
- Albums, moments, livestreams and sidecar files (GPMF/GPS telemetry, RAW
  `.GPR` companions from RAW+JPEG capture, an Edit's own Edit Decision
  List, etc.) aren't exposed by this backend - only the main rendition of
  each item is. Highlights and Edits themselves can be included with
  [`--gopro-include-edits`](#gopro-include-edits).
- This is an unofficial, reverse-engineered API. Use it with the
  expectation that GoPro could change or remove it at any time.
