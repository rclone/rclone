Rclone is a free open-source project with thousands of contributions
from volunteers all round the world and I would like to thank all of
you for donating your time to the project.

However, maintaining rclone is a lot of work - it is **my full time
job**. Nothing stands still in the world of cloud storage. Rclone
needs constant attention adapting to changes by cloud providers,
adding new providers, adding new features, keeping the integration
tests working, fixing bugs and many more things!

I love doing the work and I'd like to keep doing it - your support
helps make rclone possible.

Thank you :-)
