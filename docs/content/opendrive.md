Paths are specified as `remote:path`

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your OpenDrive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an OpenDrive directory called backup

### Modified time and MD5SUMs ###

OpenDrive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

<!--- autogenerated options start - DO NOT EDIT, instead edit fs.RegInfo in backend/opendrive/opendrive.go then run make backenddocs -->
### Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to opendrive (OpenDrive).

#### --opendrive-username

Username

- Config:      username
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OPENDRIVE_USERNAME
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --opendrive-password

Password.

- Config:      password
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OPENDRIVE_PASSWORD
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

<!--- autogenerated options stop -->

### Limitations ###

Note that OpenDrive is case insensitive so you can't have a
file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are quite a few characters that can't be in OpenDrive file
names.  These can't occur on Windows platforms, but on non-Windows
platforms they are common.  Rclone will map these names to and from an
identical looking unicode equivalent.  For example if a file has a `?`
in it will be mapped to `？` instead.
