# {{< icon "fa fa-cloud" >}} Jottacloud

Jottacloud is a cloud storage service provider from a Norwegian company, using
its own datacenters in Norway.

In addition to the official service at [jottacloud.com](https://www.jottacloud.com/),
it also provides white-label solutions to different companies. The following
are currently supported by this backend, using a different authentication setup
as described [below](#whitelabel-authentication):

- Elkjøp (with subsidiaries):
  - Elkjøp Cloud (cloud.elkjop.no)
  - Elgiganten Cloud (cloud.elgiganten.dk)
  - Elgiganten Cloud (cloud.elgiganten.se)
  - ELKO Cloud (cloud.elko.is)
  - Gigantti Cloud (cloud.gigantti.fi)
- Telia
  - Telia Cloud (cloud.telia.se)
  - Telia Sky (sky.telia.no)
- Tele2
  - Tele2 Cloud (mittcloud.tele2.se)
- Onlime
  - Onlime (onlime.dk)
- MediaMarkt
  - Let's Go Cloud (letsgo.jotta.cloud)

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Authentication types

Some of the white-label versions uses a different authentication method than the
official service, and you have to choose the correct one when setting up the remote.

### Standard authentication

The standard authentication method used by the official service (jottacloud.com),
as well as some of the white-label services, is based on OAuth 2.0 and OpenID
Connect (OIDC), and requires you to generate a single-use personal login token
from the account security settings in the service's web interface. Log in to your
account, go to "Settings" and then "Security", or use the direct link presented
to you by rclone when configuring the remote:
<https://www.jottacloud.com/web/secure>. Scroll down to the section "Personal login
token", and click the "Generate" button. Note that if you are using a white-label
service you probably can't use the direct link, you need to find the same page in
their dedicated web interface, and also it may be in a different location than
described above.

To access your account from multiple instances of rclone, you need to configure
each of them with a separate personal login token. E.g. you create a Jottacloud
remote with rclone in one location, and copy the configuration file to a second
location where you also want to run rclone and access the same remote. Then you
need to replace the token for one of them, using the [config reconnect](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_reconnect/)
command, which requires you to generate a new personal login token and supply
as input. If you do not do this, the token may easily end up being invalidated,
resulting in both instances failing with an error message something along the
lines of:

```text
  oauth2: cannot fetch token: 400 Bad Request
  Response: {"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"Stale token"}
```

When this happens, you need to replace the token as described above to be able
to use your remote again.

All personal login tokens you have taken into use will be listed in the web
interface under "My logged in devices", and from the right side of that list
you can click the "X" button to revoke individual tokens.

### Whitelabel authentication

Most of the white-label versions uses a slightly different authentication flow,
where it doesn't offer the option of creating a CLI token, and the username
is generated internally. To setup rclone to use one of these, choose white-label
authentication in the setup process, and then select the specific service
in the next step.

Note that when setting this up, you need to be on a machine with an
internet-connected web browser. If you need it on a machine where this is not
the case, then you will have to create the configuration on a different machine
and copy it from there. The jottacloud backend does not support the
`rclone authorize` command. See the [remote setup docs](/remote_setup) for
details.

### Legacy authentication

Originally Jottacloud used an older authentication method, not based on OpenID
Connect, which required the username and password to be specified. Since
Jottacloud migrated to the newer method, handled by the standard authentication,
some white-label versions (those from Elkjøp) still used the legacy method for
a long time. Currently there are no known uses of this, it is still supported
by rclone, but the support will be removed in a future version.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote` with the default setup.
First run:

```sh
rclone config
```

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```text
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

Enter name for new remote.
name> remote

Option Storage.
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.
[snip]
XX / Jottacloud
   \ (jottacloud)
[snip]
Storage> jottacloud

Option client_id.
OAuth Client Id.
Leave blank normally.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
client_id>

Option client_secret.
OAuth Client Secret.
Leave blank normally.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
client_secret>

Edit advanced config?
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n

Option config_type.
Type of authentication.
Choose a number from below, or type in an existing value of type string.
Press Enter for the default (standard).
   / Standard authentication.
 1 | Use this if you're a normal Jottacloud user.
   \ (standard)
   / Whitelabel authentication.
 2 | Use this if you are using the service offered by a third party such as Telia, Tele2, Onlime, Elkjøp, etc.
   \ (whitelabel)
   / Legacy authentication.
 3 | This is no longer supported by any known services and not recommended for normal users.
   \ (legacy)
config_type> 1

Option config_login_token.
Personal login token.
Generate here: https://www.jottacloud.com/web/secure
Enter a value.
config_login_token> <your token here>

Use a non-standard device/mountpoint?
Choosing no, the default, will let you access the storage used for the archive
section of the official Jottacloud client. If you instead want to access the
sync or the backup section, for example, you must choose yes.
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n

Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: jottacloud
- configVersion: 1
- client_id: jottacli
- client_secret:
- tokenURL: https://id.jottacloud.com/auth/realms/jottacloud/protocol/openid-connect/token
- token: {........}
- username: 2940e57271a93d987d6f8a21
- device: Jotta
- mountpoint: Archive
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Jottacloud

```sh
rclone lsd remote:
```

List all the files in your Jottacloud

```sh
rclone ls remote:
```

To copy a local directory to an Jottacloud directory called backup

```sh
rclone copy /home/source remote:backup
```

### Devices and Mountpoints

The official Jottacloud client registers a device for each computer you install
it on, and shows them in the backup section of the user interface. For each
folder you select for backup it will create a mountpoint within this device.
A built-in device called Jotta is special, and contains mountpoints Archive,
Sync and some others, used for corresponding features in official clients.

With rclone you'll want to use the standard Jotta/Archive device/mountpoint in
most cases. However, you may for example want to access files from the sync or
backup functionality provided by the official clients, and rclone therefore
provides the option to select other devices and mountpoints during config.

You are allowed to create new devices and mountpoints. All devices except the
built-in Jotta device are treated as backup devices by official Jottacloud
clients, and the mountpoints on them are individual backup sets.

With the built-in Jotta device, only existing, built-in, mountpoints can be
selected. In addition to the mentioned Archive and Sync, it may contain
several other mountpoints such as: Latest, Links, Shared and Trash. All of
these are special mountpoints with a different internal representation than
the "regular" mountpoints. Rclone will only to a very limited degree support
them. Generally you should avoid these, unless you know what you are doing.

### --fast-list

This backend supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

Note that the implementation in Jottacloud always uses only a single
API request to get the entire list, so for large folders this could
lead to long wait time before the first results are shown.

Note also that with rclone version 1.58 and newer, information about
[MIME types](/overview/#mime-type) and metadata item [utime](#metadata)
are not available when using `--fast-list`.

### Modification times and hashes

Jottacloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

Jottacloud supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the `--checksum`
flag.

Note that Jottacloud requires the MD5 hash before upload so if the
source does not have an MD5 checksum then the file will be cached
temporarily on disk (in location given by
[--temp-dir](/docs/#temp-dir-string)) before it is uploaded.
Small files will be cached in memory - see the
[--jottacloud-md5-memory-limit](#jottacloud-md5-memory-limit) flag.
When uploading from local disk the source checksum is always available,
so this does not apply. Starting with rclone version 1.52 the same is
true for encrypted remotes (in older versions the crypt backend would not
calculate hashes for uploads from local disk, so the Jottacloud
backend had to do it as described above).

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊          |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：          |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜          |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞          |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？          |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in XML strings.

### Deleting files

By default, rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files. They
will be permanently deleted automatically after 30 days. You may bypass the
trash and permanently delete files immediately by using the [--jottacloud-hard-delete](#jottacloud-hard-delete)
flag, or set the equivalent environment variable. Emptying the trash is
supported by the [cleanup](/commands/rclone_cleanup/) command.

### Versions

Jottacloud supports file versioning. When rclone uploads a new version of a
file it creates a new version of it. Currently rclone only supports retrieving
the current version but older versions can be accessed via the Jottacloud Website.

Versioning can be disabled by `--jottacloud-no-versions` option. This is
achieved by deleting the remote file prior to uploading a new version. If the
upload the fails no version of the file will be available in the remote.

### Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the `rclone about remote:`
command which will display your usage limit (unless it is unlimited)
and the current usage.

| btime | Time of file birth (creation), read from rclone metadata | RFC 3339 | 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00 | N |
| content-type | MIME type, also known as media type | string | text/plain | **Y** |
| mtime | Time of last modification, read from rclone metadata | RFC 3339 | 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00 | N |
| utime | Time of last upload, when current revision was created, generated by backend | RFC 3339 | 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00 | **Y** |

See the [metadata](/docs/#metadata) docs for more info.

{{< rem autogenerated options stop >}}

## Limitations

Note that Jottacloud is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are quite a few characters that can't be in Jottacloud file names. Rclone will map these names to and from an identical
looking unicode equivalent. For example if a file has a ? in it will be mapped to ？ instead.

Jottacloud only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.

## Troubleshooting

Jottacloud exhibits some inconsistent behaviours regarding deleted files and folders which may cause Copy, Move and DirMove
operations to previously deleted paths to fail. Emptying the trash should help in such cases.
