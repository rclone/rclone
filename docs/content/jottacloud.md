# {{< icon "fa fa-cloud" >}} Jottacloud

Jottacloud is a cloud storage service provider from a Norwegian company, using
its own datacenters in Norway.

In addition to the official service at [jottacloud.com](https://www.jottacloud.com/),
it also provides white-label solutions to different companies. The following
are currently supported by this backend, using a different authentication setup
as described [below](#whitelabel-authentication):

- Elkjøp (with subsidiaries):
  - Elkjøp Cloud (cloud.elkjop.no)
  - Elgiganten Cloud (cloud.elgiganten.dk)
  - Elgiganten Cloud (cloud.elgiganten.se)
  - ELKO Cloud (cloud.elko.is)
  - Gigantti Cloud (cloud.gigantti.fi)
- Telia
  - Telia Cloud (cloud.telia.se)
  - Telia Sky (sky.telia.no)
- Tele2
  - Tele2 Cloud (mittcloud.tele2.se)
- Onlime
  - Onlime (onlime.dk)
- MediaMarkt
  - MediaMarkt Cloud (mediamarkt.jottacloud.com)
  - Let's Go Cloud (letsgo.jotta.cloud)

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Authentication

Authentication in Jottacloud is in general based on OAuth and OpenID Connect
(OIDC). There are different variants to choose from, depending on which service
you are using, e.g. a white-label service may only support one of them. Note
that there is no documentation to rely on, so the descriptions provided here
are based on observations and may not be accurate.

Jottacloud uses two optional OAuth security mechanisms, referred to as "Refresh
Token Rotation" and "Automatic Reuse Detection", which has some implications.
Access tokens normally have one hour expiry, after which they need to be
refreshed (rotated), an operation that requires the refresh token to be
supplied. Rclone does this automatically. This is standard OAuth. But in
Jottacloud, such a refresh operation not only creates a new access token, but
also refresh token, and invalidates the existing refresh token, the one that
was supplied. It keeps track of the history of refresh tokens, sometimes
referred to as a token family, descending from the original refresh token that
was issued after the initial authentication. This is used to detect any
attempts at reusing old refresh tokens, and trigger an immedate invalidation of
the current refresh token, and effectively the entire refresh token family.

When the current refresh token has been invalidated, next time rclone tries to
perform a token refresh, it will fail with an error message something along the
lines of:

```text
CRITICAL: Failed to create file system for "remote:": (...): couldn't fetch token: invalid_grant: maybe token expired? - try refreshing with "rclone config reconnect remote:"
```

If you run rclone with verbosity level 2 (`-vv`), you will see a debug message
with an additional error description from the OAuth response:

```text
DEBUG : remote: got fatal oauth error: oauth2: "invalid_grant" "Session doesn't have required client"
```

(The error description used to be "Stale token" instead of "Session doesn't
have required client", so you may see references to that in older descriptions
of this situation.)

When this happens, you need to re-authenticate to be able to use your remote
again, e.g. using the [config reconnect](/commands/rclone_config_reconnect/)
command as suggested in the error message. This will create an entirely new
refresh token (family).

A typical example of how you may end up in this situation, is if you create
a Jottacloud remote with rclone in one location, and then copy the
configuration file to a second location where you start using rclone to access
the same remote. Eventually there will now be a token refresh attempt with an
invalidated token, i.e. refresh token reuse, resulting in both instances
starting to fail with the "invalid_grant" error. It is possible to copy remote
configurations, but you must then replace the token for one of them using the
[config reconnect](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_reconnect/)
command.

You can get some overview of your active tokens in your service's web user
interface, if you navigate to "Settings" and then "Security" (in which case
you end up at <https://www.jottacloud.com/web/secure> or similar). Down on
that page you have a section "My logged in devices". This contains a list
of entries which seemingly represents currently valid refresh tokens, or
refresh token families. From the right side of that list you can click a
button ("X") to revoke (invalidate) it, which means you will still have access
using an existing access token until that expires, but you will not be able to
perform a token refresh. Note that this entire "My logged in devices" feature
seem to behave a bit differently with different authentication variants and
with use of the different (white-label) services.

### Standard

This is an OAuth variant designed for command-line applications. It is
primarily supported by the official service (jottacloud.com), but may also be
supported by some of the white-label services. The information necessary to be
able to perform authentication, like domain name and endpoint to connect to,
are found automatically (it is encoded into the supplied login token, described
next), so you do not need to specify which service to configure.

When configuring a remote, you are asked to enter a single-use personal login
token, which you must manually generate from the account security settings in
the service's web interface. You do not need a web browser on the same machine
like with traditional OAuth, but need to use a web browser somewhere, and be
able to be copy the generated string into your rclone configuration session.
Log in to your service's web user interface, navigate to "Settings" and then
"Security", or, for the official service, use the direct link presented to you
by rclone when configuring the remote: <https://www.jottacloud.com/web/secure>.
Scroll down to the section "Personal login token", and click the "Generate"
button. Copy the presented string and paste it where rclone asks for it. Rclone
will then use this to perform an initial token request, and receive a regular
OAuth token which it stores in your remote configuration. There will then also
be a new entry in the "My logged in devices" list in the web interface, with
device name and application name "Jottacloud CLI".

Each time a new token is created this way, i.e. a new personal login token is
generated and traded in for an OAuth token, you get an entirely new refresh
token family, with a new entry in the "My logged in devices". You can create as
many remotes as you want, and use multiple instances of rclone on same or
different machine, as long as you configure them separately like this, and not
get your self into the refresh token reuse issue described above.

### Traditional

Jottacloud also supports a more traditional OAuth variant. Most of the
white-label services support this, and for many of them this is the only
alternative because they do not support personal login tokens. This method
relies on pre-defined service-specific domain names and endpoints, and rclone
need you to specify which service to configure. This also means that any
changes to existing or additions of new white-label services needs an update
in the rclone backend implementation.

When configuring a remote, you must interactively login to an OAuth
authorization web site, and a one-time authorization code is sent back to
rclone behind the scene, which it uses to request an OAuth token. This means
that you need to be on a machine with an internet-connected web browser. If you
need it on a machine where this is not the case, then you will have to create
the configuration on a different machine and copy it from there. The Jottacloud
backend does not support the `rclone authorize` command. See the
[remote setup docs](/remote_setup) for details.

Jottacloud exerts some form of strict session management when authenticating
using this method. This leads to some unexpected cases of the "invalid_grant"
error described above, and effectively limits you to only use of a single
active authentication on the same machine. I.e. you can only create a single
rclone remote, and you can't even log in with the service's official desktop
client while having a rclone remote configured, or else you will eventually get
all sessions invalidated and are forced to re-authenticate.

When you have successfully authenticated, there will be an entry in the
"My logged in devices" list in the web interface representing your session. It
will typically be listed with application name "Jottacloud for Desktop" or
similar (it depends on the white-label service configuration).

### Legacy

Originally Jottacloud used an OAuth variant which required your account's
username and password to be specified. When Jottacloud migrated to the newer
methods, some white-label versions (those from Elkjøp) still used this legacy
method for a long time. Currently there are no known uses of this, it is still
supported by rclone, but the support will be removed in a future version.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote` with the default setup.
First run:

```sh
rclone config
```

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```text
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

Enter name for new remote.
name> remote

Edit advanced config?
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n

Option config_type.
Type of authentication.
Choose a number from below, or type in an existing value of type string.
Press Enter for the default (standard).
   / Standard authentication.

Option config_login_token.
Personal login token.
Generate it from the account security settings in the web interface of your
service, for the official service on https://www.jottacloud.com/web/secure.
Enter a value.
config_login_token> <your token here>

Use a non-standard device/mountpoint?
Choosing no, the default, will let you access the storage used for the archive
section of the official Jottacloud client. If you instead want to access the
sync or the backup section, for example, you must choose yes.
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n

Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: jottacloud
- configVersion: 1
- client_id: jottacli
- client_secret:
- tokenURL: https://id.jottacloud.com/auth/realms/jottacloud/protocol/openid-connect/token
- token: {........}
- username: 2940e57271a93d987d6f8a21
- device: Jotta
- mountpoint: Archive
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Jottacloud

```sh
rclone lsd remote:
```

List all the files in your Jottacloud

```sh
rclone ls remote:
```

To copy a local directory to an Jottacloud directory called backup

```sh
rclone copy /home/source remote:backup
```

### Devices and Mountpoints

The official Jottacloud client registers a device for each computer you install
it on, and shows them in the backup section of the user interface. For each
folder you select for backup it will create a mountpoint within this device.
A built-in device called Jotta is special, and contains mountpoints Archive,
Sync and some others, used for corresponding features in official clients.

With rclone you'll want to use the standard Jotta/Archive device/mountpoint in
most cases. However, you may for example want to access files from the sync or
backup functionality provided by the official clients, and rclone therefore
provides the option to select other devices and mountpoints during config.

You are allowed to create new devices and mountpoints. All devices except the
built-in Jotta device are treated as backup devices by official Jottacloud
clients, and the mountpoints on them are individual backup sets.

With the built-in Jotta device, only existing, built-in, mountpoints can be
selected. In addition to the mentioned Archive and Sync, it may contain
several other mountpoints such as: Latest, Links, Shared and Trash. All of
these are special mountpoints with a different internal representation than
the "regular" mountpoints. Rclone will only to a very limited degree support
them. Generally you should avoid these, unless you know what you are doing.

### --fast-list

This backend supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

Note that the implementation in Jottacloud always uses only a single
API request to get the entire list, so for large folders this could
lead to long wait time before the first results are shown.

Note also that with rclone version 1.58 and newer, information about
[MIME types](/overview/#mime-type) and metadata item [utime](#metadata)
are not available when using `--fast-list`.

### Modification times and hashes

Jottacloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

Jottacloud supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the `--checksum`
flag.

Note that Jottacloud requires the MD5 hash before upload so if the
source does not have an MD5 checksum then the file will be cached
temporarily on disk (in location given by
[--temp-dir](/docs/#temp-dir-string)) before it is uploaded.
Small files will be cached in memory - see the
[--jottacloud-md5-memory-limit](#jottacloud-md5-memory-limit) flag.
When uploading from local disk the source checksum is always available,
so this does not apply. Starting with rclone version 1.52 the same is
true for encrypted remotes (in older versions the crypt backend would not
calculate hashes for uploads from local disk, so the Jottacloud
backend had to do it as described above).

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊          |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：          |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜          |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞          |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？          |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in XML strings.

### Deleting files

By default, rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files. They
will be permanently deleted automatically after 30 days. You may bypass the
trash and permanently delete files immediately by using the [--jottacloud-hard-delete](#jottacloud-hard-delete)
flag, or set the equivalent environment variable. Emptying the trash is
supported by the [cleanup](/commands/rclone_cleanup/) command.

### Versions

Jottacloud supports file versioning. When rclone uploads a new version of a
file it creates a new version of it. Currently rclone only supports retrieving
the current version but older versions can be accessed via the Jottacloud Website.

Versioning can be disabled by `--jottacloud-no-versions` option. This is
achieved by deleting the remote file prior to uploading a new version. If the
upload the fails no version of the file will be available in the remote.

### Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the `rclone about remote:`
command which will display your usage limit (unless it is unlimited)
and the current usage.

| btime | Time of file birth (creation), read from rclone metadata | RFC 3339 | 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00 | N |
| content-type | MIME type, also known as media type | string | text/plain | **Y** |
| mtime | Time of last modification, read from rclone metadata | RFC 3339 | 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00 | N |
| utime | Time of last upload, when current revision was created, generated by backend | RFC 3339 | 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00 | **Y** |

See the [metadata](/docs/#metadata) docs for more info.

## Limitations

Note that Jottacloud is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are quite a few characters that can't be in Jottacloud file names. Rclone will map these names to and from an identical
looking unicode equivalent. For example if a file has a ? in it will be mapped to ？ instead.

Jottacloud only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.

## Troubleshooting

Jottacloud exhibits some inconsistent behaviours regarding deleted files and folders which may cause Copy, Move and DirMove
operations to previously deleted paths to fail. Emptying the trash should help in such cases.
