# {{< icon "fa fa-circle" >}} Pixeldrain

This is the backend for Pixeldrain's premium filesystem feature. This is not the
same as pixeldrain's free file sharing product. The filesystem requires either a
Pro subscription or the Prepaid plan. [More information on
subscriptions](https://pixeldrain.com/#pro).

An overview of the filesystem's features and limitations is available in the
[filesystem guide](https://pixeldrain.com/filesystem) on pixeldrain.

## Usage with account

To use the personal filesystem you will need a [pixeldrain
account](https://pixeldrain.com/register) and either the Prepaid plan or one of
the Patreon-based subscriptions. After registering and subscribing, your
personal filesystem will be available at this link: <https://pixeldrain.com/d/me>.

Go to the [API keys page](https://pixeldrain.com/user/api_keys) on your account
and generate a new API key for rclone. Then run `rclone config` and use the API
key to create a new backend.

Example:

```text
No remotes found, make a new one\?
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/d/c/s/q> n

Enter name for new remote.
name> pixeldrainfs

Option Storage.
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.

...
Storage> pixeldrain

Option api_key.
API key for your pixeldrain account.
Found on https://pixeldrain.com/user/api_keys.

api_key> b1bb1e81-9b7b-406b-986a-c9b20be76e15

Option directory_id.
Root of the filesystem to use. Set to 'me' to use your personal filesystem.
Set to a shared directory ID to use a shared directory.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (me).

y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d>

Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
pixeldrainfs         pixeldrain

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q
```

## Usage without account

It is possible to gain read-only access to publicly shared directories through
rclone. For this you only need a directory ID. The directory ID can be found in
the URL of a shared directory, the URL will look like this
`https://pixeldrain.com/d/abcd1234` where `abcd1234` is the directory ID.
Directory IDs in your own filesystem can also be listed with the `lsf` command:

`rclone lsf Pixeldrain: --dirs-only -Fpi`

This will print directories in your `Pixeldrain` home directory and their public
IDs.

Enter this directory ID in the rclone config and you will be able to access the
directory.
