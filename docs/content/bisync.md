## Bisync
`bisync` is **in beta** and is considered an **advanced command**, so use with care.
Make sure you have read and understood the entire [manual](https://rclone.org/bisync) (especially the [Limitations](#limitations) section) before using, or data loss can result. Questions can be asked in the [Rclone Forum](https://forum.rclone.org/).

## Getting started {#getting-started}

- [Install rclone](/install/) and setup your remotes.
- Bisync will create its working directory
  at `~/.cache/rclone/bisync` on Linux, `/Users/yourusername/Library/Caches/rclone/bisync` on Mac,
  or `C:\Users\MyLogin\AppData\Local\rclone\bisync` on Windows.
  Make sure that this location is writable.
- Run bisync with the `--resync` flag, specifying the paths
  to the local and remote sync directory roots.
- For successive sync runs, leave off the `--resync` flag. (**Important!**)
- Consider using a [filters file](#filtering) for excluding
  unnecessary files and directories from the sync.
- Consider setting up the [--check-access](#check-access) feature
  for safety.
- On Linux or Mac, consider setting up a [crontab entry](#cron). bisync can
  safely run in concurrent cron jobs thanks to lock files it maintains.

For example, your first command might look like this:

```
rclone bisync remote1:path1 remote2:path2 --create-empty-src-dirs --compare size,modtime,checksum --slow-hash-sync-only --resilient -MvP --drive-skip-gdocs --fix-case --resync --dry-run
```
If all looks good, run it again without `--dry-run`. After that, remove `--resync` as well.

Here is a typical run log (with timestamps removed for clarity):

```

  -v, --verbose                              Increases logging verbosity. May be specified more than once for more details.
```

Arbitrary rclone flags may be specified on the
[bisync command line](/commands/rclone_bisync/), for example
`rclone bisync ./testdir/path1/ gdrive:testdir/path2/ --drive-skip-gdocs -v -v --timeout 10s`
Note that interactions of various rclone flags with bisync process flow
has not been fully tested yet.

### Paths

Path1 and Path2 arguments may be references to any mix of local directory
paths (absolute or relative), UNC paths (`//server/share/path`),
Windows drive paths (with a drive letter and `:`) or configured
[remotes](/docs/#syntax-of-remote-paths) with optional subdirectory paths.
Cloud references are distinguished by having a `:` in the argument
(see [Windows support](#windows) below).

Path1 and Path2 are treated equally, in that neither has priority for
file changes (except during [`--resync`](#resync)), and access efficiency does not change whether a remote
is on Path1 or Path2.

The listings in bisync working directory (default: `~/.cache/rclone/bisync`)
are named based on the Path1 and Path2 arguments so that separate syncs
to individual directories within the tree may be set up, e.g.:
`path_to_local_tree..dropbox_subdir.lst`.

Any empty directories after the sync on both the Path1 and Path2
filesystems are not deleted by default, unless `--create-empty-src-dirs` is specified. 
If the `--remove-empty-dirs` flag is specified, then both paths will have ALL empty directories purged
as the last step in the process.

## Command-line flags

### --resync

This will effectively make both Path1 and Path2 filesystems contain a
matching superset of all files. By default, Path2 files that do not exist in Path1 will
be copied to Path1, and the process will then copy the Path1 tree to Path2.

The `--resync` sequence is roughly equivalent to the following (but see [`--resync-mode`](#resync-mode) for other options):
```
rclone copy Path2 Path1 --ignore-existing [--create-empty-src-dirs]
rclone copy Path1 Path2 [--create-empty-src-dirs]
```

The base directories on both Path1 and Path2 filesystems must exist
or bisync will fail. This is required for safety - that bisync can verify
that both paths are valid.

When using `--resync`, a newer version of a file on the Path2 filesystem
will (by default) be overwritten by the Path1 filesystem version.
(Note that this is [NOT entirely symmetrical](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5681#issuecomment-938761815), and more symmetrical options can be specified with the [`--resync-mode`](#resync-mode) flag.)
Carefully evaluate deltas using [--dry-run](/flags/#non-backend-flags).

For a resync run, one of the paths may be empty (no files in the path tree).
The resync run should result in files on both paths, else a normal non-resync
run will fail.

For a non-resync run, either path being empty (no files in the tree) fails with
`Empty current PathN listing. Cannot sync to an empty directory: X.pathN.lst`
This is a safety check that an unexpected empty path does not result in
deleting **everything** in the other path.

Note that `--resync` implies `--resync-mode path1` unless a different
[`--resync-mode`](#resync-mode)  is explicitly specified.
It is not necessary to use both the `--resync` and `--resync-mode` flags --
either one is sufficient without the other.

**Note:** `--resync` (including `--resync-mode`) should only be used under three specific (rare) circumstances:
1. It is your _first_ bisync run (between these two paths)
2. You've just made changes to your bisync settings (such as editing the contents of your `--filters-file`)
3. There was an error on the prior run, and as a result, bisync now requires `--resync` to recover

The rest of the time, you should _omit_ `--resync`. The reason is because `--resync` will only _copy_ (not _sync_) each side to the other.
Therefore, if you included `--resync` for every bisync run, it would never be possible to delete a file --
the deleted file would always keep reappearing at the end of every run (because it's being copied from the other side where it still exists).
Similarly, renaming a file would always result in a duplicate copy (both old and new name) on both sides.

If you find that frequent interruptions from #3 are an issue, rather than
automatically running `--resync`, the recommended alternative is to use the
[`--resilient`](#resilient), [`--recover`](#recover), and
[`--conflict-resolve`](#conflict-resolve) flags, (along with [Graceful
Shutdown](#graceful-shutdown) mode, when needed) for a very robust
"set-it-and-forget-it" bisync setup that can automatically bounce back from
almost any interruption it might encounter. Consider adding something like the
following:

```
--resilient --recover --max-lock 2m --conflict-resolve newer
```

### --resync-mode CHOICE {#resync-mode}

In the event that a file differs on both sides during a `--resync`,
`--resync-mode` controls which version will overwrite the other. The supported
options are similar to [`--conflict-resolve`](#conflict-resolve). For all of
the following options, the version that is kept is referred to as the "winner",
and the version that is overwritten (deleted) is referred to as the "loser".
The options are named after the "winner":

- `path1` - (the default) - the version from Path1 is unconditionally
considered the winner (regardless of `modtime` and `size`, if any). This can be
useful if one side is more trusted or up-to-date than the other, at the time of
the `--resync`.
- `path2` - same as `path1`, except the path2 version is considered the winner.
- `newer` - the newer file (by `modtime`) is considered the winner, regardless
of which side it came from. This may result in having a mix of some winners
from Path1, and some winners from Path2. (The implementation is analogous to
running `rclone copy --update` in both directions.)
- `older` - same as `newer`, except the older file is considered the winner,
and the newer file is considered the loser.
- `larger` - the larger file (by `size`) is considered the winner (regardless
of `modtime`, if any). This can be a useful option for remotes without
`modtime` support, or with the kinds of files (such as logs) that tend to grow
but not shrink, over time.
- `smaller` - the smaller file (by `size`) is considered the winner (regardless
of `modtime`, if any).

For all of the above options, note the following:
- If either of the underlying remotes lacks support for the chosen method, it
will be ignored and will fall back to the default of `path1`. (For example, if
`--resync-mode newer` is set, but one of the paths uses a remote that doesn't
support `modtime`.)
- If a winner can't be determined because the chosen method's attribute is
missing or equal, it will be ignored, and bisync will instead try to determine
whether the files differ by looking at the other `--compare` methods in effect.
(For example, if `--resync-mode newer` is set, but the Path1 and Path2 modtimes
are identical, bisync will compare the sizes.) If bisync concludes that they
differ, preference is given to whichever is the "source" at that moment. (In
practice, this gives a slight advantage to Path2, as the 2to1 copy comes before
the 1to2 copy.) If the files _do not_ differ, nothing is copied (as both sides
are already correct).
- These options apply only to files that exist on both sides (with the same
name and relative path). Files that exist *only* on one side and not the other
are *always* copied to the other, during `--resync` (this is one of the main
differences between resync and non-resync runs.).
- `--conflict-resolve`, `--conflict-loser`, and `--conflict-suffix` do not
apply during `--resync`, and unlike these flags, nothing is renamed during
`--resync`. When a file differs on both sides during `--resync`, one version
always overwrites the other (much like in `rclone copy`.) (Consider using
[`--backup-dir`](#backup-dir1-and-backup-dir2) to retain a backup of the losing
version.)
- Unlike for `--conflict-resolve`, `--resync-mode none` is not a valid option
(or rather, it will be interpreted as "no resync", unless `--resync` has also
been specified, in which case it will be ignored.)
- Winners and losers are decided at the individual file-level only (there is
not currently an option to pick an entire winning directory atomically,
although the `path1` and `path2` options typically produce a similar result.)
- To maintain backward-compatibility, the `--resync` flag implies
`--resync-mode path1` unless a different `--resync-mode` is explicitly
specified. Similarly, all `--resync-mode` options (except `none`) imply
`--resync`, so it is not necessary to use both the `--resync` and
`--resync-mode` flags simultaneously -- either one is sufficient without the
other.


### --check-access

Access check files are an additional safety measure against data loss.
bisync will ensure it can find matching `RCLONE_TEST` files in the same places
in the Path1 and Path2 filesystems.
`RCLONE_TEST` files are not generated automatically.
For `--check-access` to succeed, you must first either:
**A)** Place one or more `RCLONE_TEST` files in both systems, or
**B)** Set `--check-filename` to a filename already in use in various locations
throughout your sync'd fileset. Recommended methods for **A)** include:
* `rclone touch Path1/RCLONE_TEST` (create a new file)
* `rclone copyto Path1/RCLONE_TEST Path2/RCLONE_TEST` (copy an existing file)
* `rclone copy Path1/RCLONE_TEST Path2/RCLONE_TEST  --include "RCLONE_TEST"` (copy multiple files at once, recursively)
* create the files manually (outside of rclone)
* run `bisync` once *without* `--check-access` to set matching files on both filesystems
will also work, but is not preferred, due to potential for user error 
(you are temporarily disabling the safety feature).

Note that `--check-access` is still enforced on `--resync`, so `bisync --resync --check-access` 
will not work as a method of initially setting the files (this is to ensure that bisync can't 
[inadvertently circumvent its own safety switch](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=3.%20%2D%2Dcheck%2Daccess%20doesn%27t%20always%20fail%20when%20it%20should).)

Time stamps and file contents for `RCLONE_TEST` files are not important, just the names and locations.
If you have symbolic links in your sync tree it is recommended to place
`RCLONE_TEST` files in the linked-to directory tree to protect against
bisync assuming a bunch of deleted files if the linked-to tree should not be
accessible.
See also the [--check-filename](--check-filename) flag.

### --check-filename

Name of the file(s) used in access health validation.
The default `--check-filename` is `RCLONE_TEST`.
One or more files having this filename must exist, synchronized between your
source and destination filesets, in order for `--check-access` to succeed.
See [--check-access](#check-access) for additional details.

### --compare

As of `v1.66`, bisync fully supports comparing based on any combination of
size, modtime, and checksum (lifting the prior restriction on backends without
modtime support.)

By default (without the `--compare` flag), bisync inherits the same comparison
options as `sync`
(that is: `size` and `modtime` by default, unless modified with flags such as
[`--checksum`](/docs/#c-checksum) or [`--size-only`](/docs/#size-only).)

If the `--compare` flag is set, it will override these defaults. This can be
useful if you wish to compare based on combinations not currently supported in
`sync`, such as comparing all three of `size` AND `modtime` AND `checksum`
simultaneously (or just `modtime` AND `checksum`).

`--compare` takes a comma-separated list, with the currently supported values
being `size`, `modtime`, and `checksum`. For example, if you want to compare
size and checksum, but not modtime, you would do:
```
--compare size,checksum
```

Or if you want to compare all three:
```
--compare size,modtime,checksum
```

`--compare` overrides any conflicting flags. For example, if you set the
conflicting flags `--compare checksum --size-only`, `--size-only` will be
ignored, and bisync will compare checksum and not size. To avoid confusion, it
is recommended to use _either_ `--compare` or the normal `sync` flags, but not
both.

If `--compare` includes `checksum` and both remotes support checksums but have
no hash types in common with each other, checksums will be considered _only_
for comparisons within the same side (to determine what has changed since the
prior sync), but not for comparisons against the opposite side. If one side
supports checksums and the other does not, checksums will only be considered on
the side that supports them.

When comparing with `checksum` and/or `size` without `modtime`, bisync cannot
determine whether a file is `newer` or `older` -- only whether it is `changed`
or `unchanged`. (If it is `changed` on both sides, bisync still does the
standard equality-check to avoid declaring a sync conflict unless it absolutely
has to.)

It is recommended to do a `--resync` when changing `--compare` settings, as
otherwise your prior listing files may not contain the attributes you wish to
compare (for example, they will not have stored checksums if you were not
previously comparing checksums.)

### --ignore-listing-checksum

When `--checksum` or `--compare checksum` is set, bisync will retrieve (or
generate) checksums (for backends that support them) when creating the listings
for both paths, and store the checksums in the listing files.
`--ignore-listing-checksum` will disable this behavior, which may speed things
up considerably, especially on backends (such as [local](/local/)) where hashes
must be computed on the fly instead of retrieved. Please note the following:

* As of `v1.66`, `--ignore-listing-checksum` is now automatically set when
neither `--checksum` nor `--compare checksum` are in use (as the checksums
would not be used for anything.)
* `--ignore-listing-checksum` is NOT the same as
[`--ignore-checksum`](/docs/#ignore-checksum),
and you may wish to use one or the other, or both. In a nutshell:
`--ignore-listing-checksum` controls whether checksums are considered when
scanning for diffs,
while `--ignore-checksum` controls whether checksums are considered during the
copy/sync operations that follow,
if there ARE diffs.
* Unless `--ignore-listing-checksum` is passed, bisync currently computes
hashes for one path
*even when there's no common hash with the other path*
(for example, a [crypt](/crypt/#modification-times-and-hashes) remote.)
This can still be beneficial, as the hashes will still be used to detect
changes within the same side
(if `--checksum` or `--compare checksum` is set), even if they can't be used to
compare against the opposite side.
* If you wish to ignore listing checksums _only_ on remotes where they are slow
to compute, consider using
[`--no-slow-hash`](#no-slow-hash) (or
[`--slow-hash-sync-only`](#slow-hash-sync-only)) instead of
`--ignore-listing-checksum`.
* If `--ignore-listing-checksum` is used simultaneously with `--compare
checksum` (or `--checksum`), checksums will be ignored for bisync deltas,
but still considered during the sync operations that follow (if deltas are
detected based on modtime and/or size.)

### --no-slow-hash

On some remotes (notably `local`), checksums can dramatically slow down a
bisync run, because hashes cannot be stored and need to be computed in
real-time when they are requested. On other remotes (such as `drive`), they add
practically no time at all. The `--no-slow-hash` flag will automatically skip
checksums on remotes where they are slow, while still comparing them on others
(assuming [`--compare`](#compare) includes `checksum`.) This can be useful when one of your
bisync paths is slow but you still want to check checksums on the other, for a more
robust sync.

### --slow-hash-sync-only

Same as [`--no-slow-hash`](#no-slow-hash), except slow hashes are still
considered during sync calls. They are still NOT considered for determining
deltas, nor or they included in listings. They are also skipped during
`--resync`. The main use case for this flag is when you have a large number of
files, but relatively few of them change from run to run -- so you don't want
to check your entire tree every time (it would take too long), but you still
want to consider checksums for the smaller group of files for which a `modtime`
or `size` change was detected. Keep in mind that this speed savings comes with
a safety trade-off: if a file's content were to change without a change to its
`modtime` or `size`, bisync would not detect it, and it would not be synced.

`--slow-hash-sync-only` is only useful if both remotes share a common hash
type (if they don't, bisync will automatically fall back to `--no-slow-hash`.)
Both `--no-slow-hash` and `--slow-hash-sync-only` have no effect without
`--compare checksum` (or `--checksum`).

### --download-hash

If `--download-hash` is set, bisync will use best efforts to obtain an MD5
checksum by downloading and computing on-the-fly, when checksums are not
otherwise available (for example, a remote that doesn't support them.) Note
that since rclone has to download the entire file, this may dramatically slow
down your bisync runs, and is also likely to use a lot of data, so it is
probably not practical for bisync paths with a large total file size. However,
it can be a good option for syncing small-but-important files with maximum
accuracy (for example, a source code repo on a `crypt` remote.) An additional
advantage over methods like [`cryptcheck`](/commands/rclone_cryptcheck/) is
that the original file is not required for comparison (for example,
`--download-hash` can be used to bisync two different crypt remotes with
different passwords.)

When `--download-hash` is set, bisync still looks for more efficient checksums
first, and falls back to downloading only when none are found. It takes
priority over conflicting flags such as `--no-slow-hash`. `--download-hash` is
not suitable for [Google Docs](#gdocs) and other files of unknown size, as
their checksums would change from run to run (due to small variances in the
internals of the generated export file.) Therefore, bisync automatically skips
`--download-hash` for files with a size less than 0.

[`cryptcheck`](/commands/rclone_cryptcheck/) command, [`rclone check
--download`](/commands/rclone_check/) option,
[`md5sum`](/commands/rclone_md5sum/) command

### --max-delete

As a safety check, if greater than the `--max-delete` percent of files were
deleted on either the Path1 or Path2 filesystem, then bisync will abort with
a warning message, without making any changes.
The default `--max-delete` is `50%`.
One way to trigger this limit is to rename a directory that contains more
than half of your files. This will appear to bisync as a bunch of deleted
files and a bunch of new files.
This safety check is intended to block bisync from deleting all of the
files on both filesystems due to a temporary network access issue, or if
the user had inadvertently deleted the files on one side or the other.
To force the sync, either set a different delete percentage limit,
e.g. `--max-delete 75` (allows up to 75% deletion), or use `--force`
to bypass the check.

Also see the [all files changed](#all-files-changed) check.

### --filters-file {#filters-file}

By using rclone filter features you can exclude file types or directory
sub-trees from the sync.
See the [bisync filters](#filtering) section and generic
[--filter-from](/filtering/#filter-from-read-filtering-patterns-from-a-file)
documentation.
An [example filters file](#example-filters-file) contains filters for
non-allowed files for syncing with Dropbox.

If you make changes to your filters file then bisync requires a run
with `--resync`. This is a safety feature, which prevents existing files
on the Path1 and/or Path2 side from seeming to disappear from view
(since they are excluded in the new listings), which would fool bisync
into seeing them as deleted (as compared to the prior run listings),
and then bisync would proceed to delete them for real.

To block this from happening, bisync calculates an MD5 hash of the filters file
and stores the hash in a `.md5` file in the same place as your filters file.
On the next run with `--filters-file` set, bisync re-calculates the MD5 hash
of the current filters file and compares it to the hash stored in the `.md5` file.
If they don't match, the run aborts with a critical error and thus forces you
to do a `--resync`, likely avoiding a disaster.

### --conflict-resolve CHOICE {#conflict-resolve}

In bisync, a "conflict" is a file that is *new* or *changed* on *both sides*
(relative to the prior run) AND is *not currently identical* on both sides.
`--conflict-resolve` controls how bisync handles such a scenario. The currently
supported options are:

- `none` - (the default) - do not attempt to pick a winner, keep and rename
both files according to [`--conflict-loser`](#conflict-loser) and
[`--conflict-suffix`](#conflict-suffix) settings. For example, with the default
settings, `file.txt` on Path1 is renamed `file.txt.conflict1` and `file.txt` on
Path2 is renamed `file.txt.conflict2`. Both are copied to the opposite path
during the run, so both sides end up with a copy of both files. (As `none` is
the default, it is not necessary to specify `--conflict-resolve none` -- you
can just omit the flag.)
- `newer` - the newer file (by `modtime`) is considered the winner and is
copied without renaming. The older file (the "loser") is handled according to
`--conflict-loser` and `--conflict-suffix` settings (either renamed or
deleted.) For example, if `file.txt` on Path1 is newer than `file.txt` on
Path2, the result on both sides (with other default settings) will be `file.txt`
(winner from Path1) and `file.txt.conflict1` (loser from Path2).
- `older` - same as `newer`, except the older file is considered the winner,
and the newer file is considered the loser.
- `larger` - the larger file (by `size`) is considered the winner (regardless
of `modtime`, if any).
- `smaller` - the smaller file (by `size`) is considered the winner (regardless
of `modtime`, if any).
- `path1` - the version from Path1 is unconditionally considered the winner
(regardless of `modtime` and `size`, if any). This can be useful if one side is
usually more trusted or up-to-date than the other.
- `path2` - same as `path1`, except the path2 version is considered the
winner.

For all of the above options, note the following:
- If either of the underlying remotes lacks support for the chosen method, it
will be ignored and fall back to `none`. (For example, if `--conflict-resolve
newer` is set, but one of the paths uses a remote that doesn't support
`modtime`.)
- If a winner can't be determined because the chosen method's attribute is
missing or equal, it will be ignored and fall back to `none`. (For example, if
`--conflict-resolve newer` is set, but the Path1 and Path2 modtimes are
identical, even if the sizes may differ.)
- If the file's content is currently identical on both sides, it is not
considered a "conflict", even if new or changed on both sides since the prior
sync. (For example, if you made a change on one side and then synced it to the
other side by other means.) Therefore, none of the conflict resolution flags
apply in this scenario.
- The conflict resolution flags do not apply during a `--resync`, as there is
no "prior run" to speak of (but see [`--resync-mode`](#resync-mode) for similar
options.)

### --conflict-loser CHOICE {#conflict-loser}

`--conflict-loser` determines what happens to the "loser" of a sync conflict
(when [`--conflict-resolve`](#conflict-resolve) determines a winner) or to both
files (when there is no winner.) The currently supported options are:

- `num` - (the default) - auto-number the conflicts by automatically appending
the next available number to the `--conflict-suffix`, in chronological order.
For example, with the default settings, the first conflict for `file.txt` will
be renamed `file.txt.conflict1`. If `file.txt.conflict1` already exists,
`file.txt.conflict2` will be used instead (etc., up to a maximum of
9223372036854775807 conflicts.)
- `pathname` - rename the conflicts according to which side they came from,
which was the default behavior prior to `v1.66`. For example, with
`--conflict-suffix path`, `file.txt` from Path1 will be renamed
`file.txt.path1`, and `file.txt` from Path2 will be renamed `file.txt.path2`.
If two non-identical suffixes are provided (ex. `--conflict-suffix
cloud,local`), the trailing digit is omitted. Importantly, note that with
`pathname`, there is no auto-numbering beyond `2`, so if `file.txt.path2`
somehow already exists, it will be overwritten. Using a dynamic date variable
in your `--conflict-suffix` (see below) is one possible way to avoid this. Note
also that conflicts-of-conflicts are possible, if the original conflict is not
manually resolved -- for example, if for some reason you edited
`file.txt.path1` on both sides, and those edits were different, the result
would be `file.txt.path1.path1` and `file.txt.path1.path2` (in addition to
`file.txt.path2`.)
- `delete` - keep the winner only and delete the loser, instead of renaming it.
If a winner cannot be determined (see `--conflict-resolve` for details on how
this could happen), `delete` is ignored and the default `num` is used instead
(i.e. both versions are kept and renamed, and neither is deleted.) `delete` is
inherently the most destructive option, so use it only with care.

For all of the above options, note that if a winner cannot be determined (see
`--conflict-resolve` for details on how this could happen), or if
`--conflict-resolve` is not in use, *both* files will be renamed.

### --conflict-suffix STRING[,STRING] {#conflict-suffix}

`--conflict-suffix` controls the suffix that is appended when bisync renames a
[`--conflict-loser`](#conflict-loser) (default: `conflict`).
`--conflict-suffix` will accept either one string or two comma-separated
strings to assign different suffixes to Path1 vs. Path2. This may be helpful
later in identifying the source of the conflict. (For example,
`--conflict-suffix dropboxconflict,laptopconflict`)

With `--conflict-loser num`, a number is always appended to the suffix. With
`--conflict-loser pathname`, a number is appended only when one suffix is
specified (or when two identical suffixes are specified.) i.e. with
`--conflict-loser pathname`, all of the following would produce exactly the
same result:

```
--conflict-suffix path
--conflict-suffix path,path
--conflict-suffix path1,path2
```

Suffixes may be as short as 1 character. By default, the suffix is appended
after any other extensions (ex. `file.jpg.conflict1`), however, this can be
changed with the [`--suffix-keep-extension`](/docs/#suffix-keep-extension) flag
(i.e. to instead result in `file.conflict1.jpg`).

`--conflict-suffix` supports several *dynamic date variables* when enclosed in
curly braces as globs. This can be helpful to track the date and/or time that
each conflict was handled by bisync. For example:

```
--conflict-suffix {DateOnly}-conflict
// result: myfile.txt.2006-01-02-conflict1
```

All of the formats described [here](https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants) and
[here](https://pkg.go.dev/time#example-Time.Format) are supported, but take
care to ensure that your chosen format does not use any characters that are
illegal on your remotes (for example, macOS does not allow colons in
filenames, and slashes are also best avoided as they are often interpreted as
directory separators.) To address this particular issue, an additional
`{MacFriendlyTime}` (or just `{mac}`) option is supported, which results in
`2006-01-02 0304PM`.

Note that `--conflict-suffix` is entirely separate from rclone's main
[`--sufix`](/docs/#suffix-string) flag. This is intentional, as users may wish
to use both flags simultaneously, if also using
[`--backup-dir`](#backup-dir1-and-backup-dir2).

Finally, note that the default in bisync prior to `v1.66` was to rename
conflicts with `..path1` and `..path2` (with two periods, and `path` instead of
`conflict`.) Bisync now defaults to a single dot instead of a double dot, but
additional dots can be added by including them in the specified suffix string.
For example, for behavior equivalent to the previous default, use:

```
[--conflict-resolve none] --conflict-loser pathname --conflict-suffix .path
```

### --check-sync

Enabled by default, the check-sync function checks that all of the same
files exist in both the Path1 and Path2 history listings. This _check-sync_
integrity check is performed at the end of the sync run by default.
Any untrapped failing copy/deletes between the two paths might result
in differences between the two listings and in the untracked file content
differences between the two paths. A resync run would correct the error.

Note that the default-enabled integrity check locally executes a load of both
the final Path1 and Path2 listings, and thus adds to the run time of a sync.
Using `--check-sync=false` will disable it and may significantly reduce the
sync run times for very large numbers of files.

The check may be run manually with `--check-sync=only`. It runs only the
integrity check and terminates without actually syncing.

Note that currently, `--check-sync` **only checks listing snapshots and NOT the
actual files on the remotes.** Note also that the listing snapshots will not
know about any changes that happened during or after the latest bisync run, as
those will be discovered on the next run. Therefore, while listings should
always match _each other_ at the end of a bisync run, it is _expected_ that
they will not match the underlying remotes, nor will the remotes match each
other, if there were changes during or after the run. This is normal, and any
differences will be detected and synced on the next run.

For a robust integrity check of the current state of the remotes (as opposed to just their listing snapshots), consider using [`check`](commands/rclone_check/)
(or [`cryptcheck`](/commands/rclone_cryptcheck/), if at least one path is a `crypt` remote) instead of `--check-sync`, 
keeping in mind that differences are expected if files changed during or after your last bisync run.

For example, a possible sequence could look like this:

1. Normally scheduled bisync run:

```
rclone bisync Path1 Path2 -MPc --check-access --max-delete 10 --filters-file /path/to/filters.txt -v --no-cleanup --ignore-listing-checksum --disable ListR --checkers=16 --drive-pacer-min-sleep=10ms --create-empty-src-dirs --resilient
```

2. Periodic independent integrity check (perhaps scheduled nightly or weekly):

```
rclone check -MvPc Path1 Path2 --filter-from /path/to/filters.txt
```

3. If diffs are found, you have some choices to correct them.
If one side is more up-to-date and you want to make the other side match it, you could run:

```
rclone sync Path1 Path2 --filter-from /path/to/filters.txt --create-empty-src-dirs -MPc -v
```
(or switch Path1 and Path2 to make Path2 the source-of-truth)

Or, if neither side is totally up-to-date, you could run a `--resync` to bring them back into agreement
(but remember that this could cause deleted files to re-appear.)

*Note also that `rclone check` does not currently include empty directories,
so if you want to know if any empty directories are out of sync,
consider alternatively running the above `rclone sync` command with `--dry-run` added.

### --resilient

***Caution: this is an experimental feature. Use at your own risk!***

By default, most errors or interruptions will cause bisync to abort and
require [`--resync`](#resync) to recover. This is a safety feature,  to prevent
bisync from running again until a user checks things out.  However, in some
cases, bisync can go too far and enforce a lockout when one isn't actually
necessary,  like for certain less-serious errors that might resolve themselves
on the next run.  When `--resilient` is specified, bisync tries its best to
recover and self-correct,  and only requires `--resync` as a last resort when a
human's involvement is absolutely necessary.  The intended use case is for
running bisync as a background process (such as via scheduled [cron](#cron)).

When using `--resilient` mode, bisync will still report the error and abort,
however it will not lock out future runs -- allowing the possibility of
retrying at the next normally scheduled time,  without requiring a `--resync`
first. Examples of such retryable errors include  access test failures, missing
listing files, and filter change detections.  These safety features will still
prevent the *current* run from proceeding --  the difference is that if
conditions have improved by the time of the *next* run,  that next run will be
allowed to proceed.  Certain more serious errors will still enforce a
`--resync` lockout, even in `--resilient` mode, to prevent data loss.

Behavior of `--resilient` may change in a future version. (See also:
[`--recover`](#recover), [`--max-lock`](#max-lock), [Graceful
Shutdown](#graceful-shutdown))

### --recover

If `--recover` is set, in the event of a sudden interruption or other
un-graceful shutdown, bisync will attempt to automatically recover on the next
run, instead of requiring `--resync`. Bisync is able to recover robustly by
keeping one "backup" listing at all times, representing the state of both paths
after the last known successful sync. Bisync can then compare the current state
with this snapshot to determine which changes it needs to retry. Changes that
were synced after this snapshot (during the run that was later interrupted)
will appear to bisync as if they are "new or changed on both sides", but in
most cases this is not a problem, as bisync will simply do its usual "equality
check" and learn that no action needs to be taken on these files, since they
are already identical on both sides.

In the rare event that a file is synced successfully during a run that later
aborts, and then that same file changes AGAIN before the next run, bisync will
think it is a sync conflict, and handle it accordingly. (From bisync's
perspective, the file has changed on both sides since the last trusted sync,
and the files on either side are not currently identical.) Therefore,
`--recover` carries with it a slightly increased chance of having conflicts --
though in practice this is pretty rare, as the conditions required to cause it
are quite specific. This risk can be reduced by using bisync's ["Graceful
Shutdown"](#graceful-shutdown) mode (triggered by sending `SIGINT` or
`Ctrl+C`), when you have the choice, instead of forcing a sudden termination.

`--recover` and `--resilient` are similar, but distinct -- the main difference
is that `--resilient` is about _retrying_, while `--recover` is about
_recovering_. Most users will probably want both. `--resilient` allows retrying
when bisync has chosen to abort itself due to safety features such as failing
`--check-access` or detecting a filter change. `--resilient` does not cover
external interruptions such as a user shutting down their computer in the
middle of a sync -- that is what `--recover` is for.

### --max-lock

Bisync uses [lock files](#lock-file) as a safety feature to prevent
interference from other bisync runs while it is running. Bisync normally
removes these lock files at the end of a run, but if bisync is abruptly
interrupted, these files will be left behind. By default, they will lock out
all future runs, until the user has a chance to manually check things out and
remove the lock. As an alternative, `--max-lock` can be used to make them
automatically expire after a certain period of time, so that future runs are
not locked out forever, and auto-recovery is possible. `--max-lock` can be any
duration `2m` or greater (or `0` to disable). If set, lock files older than
this will be considered "expired", and future runs will be allowed to disregard
them and proceed. (Note that the `--max-lock` duration must be set by the
process that left the lock file -- not the later one interpreting it.)

If set, bisync will also "renew" these lock files every `--max-lock minus one
minute` throughout a run, for extra safety. (For example, with `--max-lock 5m`,
bisync would renew the lock file (for another 5 minutes) every 4 minutes until
the run has completed.) In other words, it should not be possible for a lock
file to pass its expiration time while the process that created it is still
running -- and you can therefore be reasonably sure that any _expired_ lock
file you may find was left there by an interrupted run, not one that is still
running and just taking awhile.

If `--max-lock` is `0` or not set, the default is that lock files will never
expire, and will block future runs (of these same two bisync paths)
indefinitely.

For maximum resilience from disruptions, consider setting a relatively short
duration like `--max-lock 2m` along with [`--resilient`](#resilient) and
[`--recover`](#recover), and a relatively frequent [cron schedule](#cron). The
result will be a very robust "set-it-and-forget-it" bisync run that can
automatically bounce back from almost any interruption it might encounter,
without requiring the user to get involved and run a `--resync`. (See also:
[Graceful Shutdown](#graceful-shutdown) mode)


### --backup-dir1 and --backup-dir2

As of `v1.66`, [`--backup-dir`](/docs/#backup-dir-string) is supported in bisync.
Because `--backup-dir` must be a non-overlapping path on the same remote,
Bisync has introduced new `--backup-dir1` and `--backup-dir2` flags to support
separate backup-dirs for `Path1` and `Path2` (bisyncing between different
remotes with `--backup-dir` would not otherwise be possible.) `--backup-dir1`
and `--backup-dir2` can use different remotes from each other, but
`--backup-dir1` must use the same remote as `Path1`, and `--backup-dir2` must
use the same remote as `Path2`. Each backup directory must not overlap its
respective bisync Path without being excluded by a filter rule.

The standard `--backup-dir` will also work, if both paths use the same remote
(but note that deleted files from both paths would be mixed together in the
same dir). If either `--backup-dir1` and `--backup-dir2` are set, they will
override `--backup-dir`.

Example:
```
rclone bisync /Users/someuser/some/local/path/Bisync gdrive:Bisync --backup-dir1 /Users/someuser/some/local/path/BackupDir --backup-dir2 gdrive:BackupDir --suffix -2023-08-26 --suffix-keep-extension --check-access --max-delete 10 --filters-file /Users/someuser/some/local/path/bisync_filters.txt --no-cleanup --ignore-listing-checksum --checkers=16 --drive-pacer-min-sleep=10ms --create-empty-src-dirs --resilient -MvP --drive-skip-gdocs --fix-case
```

In this example, if the user deletes a file in
`/Users/someuser/some/local/path/Bisync`, bisync will propagate the delete to
the other side by moving the corresponding file from `gdrive:Bisync` to
`gdrive:BackupDir`. If the user deletes a file from `gdrive:Bisync`, bisync
moves it from `/Users/someuser/some/local/path/Bisync` to
`/Users/someuser/some/local/path/BackupDir`.

In the event of a [rename due to a sync conflict](#conflict-loser), the
rename is not considered a delete, unless a previous conflict with the same
name already exists and would get overwritten.

See also: [`--suffix`](/docs/#suffix-string),
[`--suffix-keep-extension`](/docs/#suffix-keep-extension)

## Operation

### Runtime flow details

bisync retains the listings of the `Path1` and `Path2` filesystems
from the prior run.
On each successive run it will:

- list files on `path1` and `path2`, and check for changes on each side.
  Changes include `New`, `Newer`, `Older`, and `Deleted` files.
- Propagate changes on `path1` to `path2`, and vice-versa.

### Safety measures

- Lock file prevents multiple simultaneous runs when taking a while.
  This can be particularly useful if bisync is run by cron scheduler.
- Handle change conflicts non-destructively by creating
  `.conflict1`, `.conflict2`, etc. file versions, according to
  [`--conflict-resolve`](#conflict-resolve), [`--conflict-loser`](#conflict-loser), and [`--conflict-suffix`](#conflict-suffix) settings.
- File system access health check using `RCLONE_TEST` files
  (see the `--check-access` flag).
- Abort on excessive deletes - protects against a failed listing
  being interpreted as all the files were deleted.
  See the `--max-delete` and `--force` flags.
- If something evil happens, bisync goes into a safe state to block
  damage by later runs. (See [Error Handling](#error-handling))

Path1 deleted AND Path2 changed | File is deleted on Path1 AND changed (newer/older/size) on Path2 | Path2 version survives  | `rclone copy` Path2 to Path1

As of `rclone v1.64`, bisync is now better at detecting *false positive* sync conflicts, 
which would previously have resulted in unnecessary renames and duplicates. 
Now, when bisync comes to a file that it wants to rename (because it is new/changed on both sides), 
it first checks whether the Path1 and Path2 versions are currently *identical* 
(using the same underlying function as [`check`](commands/rclone_check/).) 
If bisync concludes that the files are identical, it will skip them and move on. 
Otherwise, it will create renamed duplicates, as before.
This behavior also [improves the experience of renaming directories](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=Renamed%20directories), 
as a `--resync` is no longer required, so long as the same change has been made on both sides.

### All files changed check {#all-files-changed}

If _all_ prior existing files on either of the filesystems have changed
(e.g. timestamps have changed due to changing the system's timezone)
then bisync will abort without making any changes.
Any new files are not considered for this check. You could use `--force`
to force the sync (whichever side has the changed timestamp files wins).
Alternately, a `--resync` may be used (Path1 versions will be pushed
to Path2). Consider the situation carefully and perhaps use `--dry-run`
before you commit to the changes.

### Modification times

By default, bisync compares files by modification time and size.
If you or your application should change the content of a file
without changing the modification time and size, then bisync will _not_
notice the change, and thus will not copy it to the other side.
As an alternative, consider comparing by checksum (if your remotes support it).
See [`--compare`](#compare) for details.

### Error handling {#error-handling}

Certain bisync critical errors, such as file copy/move failing, will result in
a bisync lockout of following runs. The lockout is asserted because the sync
status and history of the Path1 and Path2 filesystems cannot be trusted,
so it is safer to block any further changes until someone checks things out.
The recovery is to do a `--resync` again.

It is recommended to use `--resync --dry-run --verbose` initially and
_carefully_ review what changes will be made before running the `--resync`
without `--dry-run`.

Most of these events come up due to an error status from an internal call.
On such a critical error the `{...}.path1.lst` and `{...}.path2.lst`
listing files are renamed to extension `.lst-err`, which blocks any future
bisync runs (since the normal `.lst` files are not found).
Bisync keeps them under `bisync` subdirectory of the rclone cache directory,
typically at `${HOME}/.cache/rclone/bisync/` on Linux.

Some errors are considered temporary and re-running the bisync is not blocked.
The _critical return_ blocks further bisync runs.

See also: [`--resilient`](#resilient), [`--recover`](#recover),
[`--max-lock`](#max-lock), [Graceful Shutdown](#graceful-shutdown)

### Lock file

When bisync is running, a lock file is created in the bisync working directory,
typically at `~/.cache/rclone/bisync/PATH1..PATH2.lck` on Linux.
If bisync should crash or hang, the lock file will remain in place and block
any further runs of bisync _for the same paths_.
Delete the lock file as part of debugging the situation.
The lock file effectively blocks follow-on (e.g., scheduled by _cron_) runs
when the prior invocation is taking a long time.
The lock file contains _PID_ of the blocking process, which may help in debug.
Lock files can be set to automatically expire after a certain amount of time,
using the [`--max-lock`](#max-lock) flag.

**Note**
that while concurrent bisync runs are allowed, _be very cautious_
that there is no overlap in the trees being synched between concurrent runs,
lest there be replicated files, deleted files and general mayhem.

### Exit codes

`rclone bisync` returns the following codes to calling program:
- `0` on a successful run,
- `1` for a non-critical failing run (a rerun may be successful),
- `2` on syntax or usage error,
- `7` for a critically aborted run (requires a `--resync` to recover).

See also the section about [exit codes](/docs/#exit-code) in main docs.

### Graceful Shutdown

Bisync has a "Graceful Shutdown" mode which is activated by sending `SIGINT` or
pressing `Ctrl+C` during a run. Once triggered, bisync will use best efforts to
exit cleanly before the timer runs out. If bisync is in the middle of
transferring files, it will attempt to cleanly empty its queue by finishing
what it has started but not taking more. If it cannot do so within 30 seconds,
it will cancel the in-progress transfers at that point and then give itself a
maximum of 60 seconds to wrap up, save its state for next time, and exit. With
the `-vP` flags you will see constant status updates and a final confirmation
of whether or not the graceful shutdown was successful.

At any point during the "Graceful Shutdown" sequence, a second `SIGINT` or
`Ctrl+C` will trigger an immediate, un-graceful exit, which will leave things
in a messier state. Usually a robust recovery will still be possible if using
[`--recover`](#recover) mode, otherwise you will need to do a `--resync`.

If you plan to use Graceful Shutdown mode, it is recommended to use
[`--resilient`](#resilient) and [`--recover`](#recover), and it is important to
NOT use [`--inplace`](/docs/#inplace), otherwise you risk leaving
partially-written files on one side, which may be confused for real files on
the next run. Note also that in the event of an abrupt interruption, a [lock
file](#lock-file) will be left behind to block concurrent runs. You will need
to delete it before you can proceed with the next run (or wait for it to
expire on its own, if using `--max-lock`.)

## Limitations

### Supported backends

Bisync is considered _BETA_ and has been tested with the following backends:
- Local filesystem
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- OneDrive
- S3
- SFTP
- Yandex Disk
- Crypt

It has not been fully tested with other services yet.
If it works, or sorta works, please let us know and we'll update the list.
Run the test suite to check for proper operation as described below.

The first release of `rclone bisync` required both underlying backends to support
modification times, and refused to run otherwise.
This limitation has been lifted as of `v1.66`, as bisync now supports comparing 
checksum and/or size instead of (or in addition to) modtime.
See [`--compare`](#compare) for details.

### Concurrent modifications

When using **Local, FTP or SFTP** remotes with [`--inplace`](/docs/#inplace), rclone does not create _temporary_
files at the destination when copying, and thus if the connection is lost
the created file may be corrupt, which will likely propagate back to the
original path on the next sync, resulting in data loss.
It is therefore recommended to _omit_ `--inplace`.

Files that **change during** a bisync run may result in data loss.
Prior to `rclone v1.66`, this was commonly seen in highly dynamic environments, where the filesystem
was getting hammered by running processes during the sync.
As of `rclone v1.66`, bisync was redesigned to use a "snapshot" model,
greatly reducing the risks from changes during a sync.
Changes that are not detected during the current sync will now be detected during the following sync,
and will no longer cause the entire run to throw a critical error.
There is additionally a mechanism to mark files as needing to be internally rechecked next time, for added safety.
It should therefore no longer be necessary to sync only at quiet times --
however, note that an error can still occur if a file happens to change at the exact moment it's
being read/written by bisync (same as would happen in `rclone sync`.)
(See also: [`--ignore-checksum`](https://rclone.org/docs/#ignore-checksum),
[`--local-no-check-updated`](https://rclone.org/local/#local-no-check-updated))

### Empty directories

By default, new/deleted empty directories on one path are _not_ propagated to the other side.
This is because bisync (and rclone) natively works on files, not directories.
However, this can be changed with the `--create-empty-src-dirs` flag, which works in
much the same way as in [`sync`](/commands/rclone_sync/) and [`copy`](/commands/rclone_copy/).
When used, empty directories created or deleted on one side will also be created or deleted on the other side.
The following should be noted:
* `--create-empty-src-dirs` is not compatible with `--remove-empty-dirs`. Use only one or the other (or neither).
* It is not recommended to switch back and forth between `--create-empty-src-dirs` 
and the default (no `--create-empty-src-dirs`) without running `--resync`. 
This is because it may appear as though all directories (not just the empty ones) were created/deleted,
when actually you've just toggled between making them visible/invisible to bisync. 
It looks scarier than it is, but it's still probably best to stick to one or the other, 
and use `--resync` when you need to switch.

### Renamed directories

By default, renaming a folder on the Path1 side results in deleting all files on
the Path2 side and then copying all files again from Path1 to Path2.
Bisync sees this as all files in the old directory name as deleted and all
files in the new directory name as new. 

A recommended solution is to use [`--track-renames`](/docs/#track-renames),
which is now supported in bisync as of `rclone v1.66`.
Note that `--track-renames` is not available during `--resync`,
as `--resync` does not delete anything (`--track-renames` only supports `sync`, not `copy`.)

Otherwise, the most effective and efficient method of renaming a directory
is to rename it to the same name on both sides. (As of `rclone v1.64`, 
a `--resync` is no longer required after doing so, as bisync will automatically
detect that Path1 and Path2 are in agreement.)

### `--fast-list` used by default

Unlike most other rclone commands, bisync uses [`--fast-list`](/docs/#fast-list) by default, 
for backends that support it. In many cases this is desirable, however, 
there are some scenarios in which bisync could be faster *without* `--fast-list`, 
and there is also a [known issue concerning Google Drive users with many empty directories](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/cbf3d4356135814921382dd3285d859d15d0aa77). 
For now, the recommended way to avoid using `--fast-list` is to add `--disable ListR` 
to all bisync commands. The default behavior may change in a future version.

### Case (and unicode) sensitivity {#case-sensitivity}

As of `v1.66`, case and unicode form differences no longer cause critical errors,
and normalization (when comparing between filesystems) is handled according to the same flags and defaults as `rclone sync`.
See the following options (all of which are supported by bisync) to control this behavior more granularly:
- [`--fix-case`](/docs/#fix-case)
- [`--ignore-case-sync`](/docs/#ignore-case-sync)
- [`--no-unicode-normalization`](/docs/#no-unicode-normalization)
- [`--local-unicode-normalization`](/local/#local-unicode-normalization) and
[`--local-case-sensitive`](/local/#local-case-sensitive) (caution: these are normally not what you want.)

Note that in the (probably rare) event that `--fix-case` is used AND a file is new/changed on both sides 
AND the checksums match AND the filename case does not match, the Path1 filename is considered the winner, 
for the purposes of `--fix-case` (Path2 will be renamed to match it).

## Windows support {#windows}

Bisync has been tested on Windows 8.1, Windows 10 Pro 64-bit and on Windows
GitHub runners.

Drive letters are allowed, including drive letters mapped to network drives
(`rclone bisync J:\localsync GDrive:`).
If a drive letter is omitted, the shell current drive is the default.
Drive letters are a single character follows by `:`, so cloud names
must be more than one character long.

Absolute paths (with or without a drive letter), and relative paths
(with or without a drive letter) are supported.

Working directory is created at `C:\Users\MyLogin\AppData\Local\rclone\bisync`.

Note that bisync output may show a mix of forward `/` and back `\` slashes.

Be careful of case independent directory and file naming on Windows
vs. case dependent Linux

## Filtering {#filtering}

See [filtering documentation](/filtering/)
for how filter rules are written and interpreted.

Bisync's [`--filters-file`](#filters-file) flag slightly extends the rclone's
[--filter-from](/filtering/#filter-from-read-filtering-patterns-from-a-file)
filtering mechanism.
For a given bisync run you may provide _only one_ `--filters-file`.
The `--include*`, `--exclude*`, and `--filter` flags are also supported.

### How to filter directories

Filtering portions of the directory tree is a critical feature for syncing.

Examples of directory trees (always beneath the Path1/Path2 root level)
you may want to exclude from your sync:
- Directory trees containing only software build intermediate files.
- Directory trees containing application temporary files and data
  such as the Windows `C:\Users\MyLogin\AppData\` tree.
- Directory trees containing files that are large, less important,
  or are getting thrashed continuously by ongoing processes.

On the other hand, there may be only select directories that you
actually want to sync, and exclude all others. See the
[Example include-style filters for Windows user directories](#include-filters)
below.

### Filters file writing guidelines

1. Begin with excluding directory trees:
    - e.g. `- /AppData/`
    - `**` on the end is not necessary. Once a given directory level
      is excluded then everything beneath it won't be looked at by rclone.
    - Exclude such directories that are unneeded, are big, dynamically thrashed,
      or where there may be access permission issues.
    - Excluding such dirs first will make rclone operations (much) faster.
    - Specific files may also be excluded, as with the Dropbox exclusions
      example below.
2. Decide if it's easier (or cleaner) to:
    - Include select directories and therefore _exclude everything else_ -- or --
    - Exclude select directories and therefore _include everything else_
3. Include select directories:
    - Add lines like: `+ /Documents/PersonalFiles/**` to select which
      directories to include in the sync.
    - `**` on the end specifies to include the full depth of the specified tree.
    - With Include-style filters, files at the Path1/Path2 root are not included.
      They may be included with `+ /*`.
    - Place RCLONE_TEST files within these included directory trees.
      They will only be looked for in these directory trees.
    - Finish by excluding everything else by adding `- **` at the end
      of the filters file.
    - Disregard step 4.
4. Exclude select directories:
    - Add more lines like in step 1.
      For example: `-/Desktop/tempfiles/`, or `- /testdir/`.
      Again, a `**` on the end is not necessary.
    - Do _not_ add a `- **` in the file. Without this line, everything
      will be included that has not been explicitly excluded.
    - Disregard step 3.

A few rules for the syntax of a filter file expanding on
[filtering documentation](/filtering/):

- Lines may start with spaces and tabs - rclone strips leading whitespace.
- If the first non-whitespace character is a `#` then the line is a comment
  and will be ignored.
- Blank lines are ignored.
- The first non-whitespace character on a filter line must be a `+` or `-`.
- Exactly 1 space is allowed between the `+/-` and the path term.
- Only forward slashes (`/`) are used in path terms, even on Windows.
- The rest of the line is taken as the path term.
  Trailing whitespace is taken literally, and probably is an error.

### Example include-style filters for Windows user directories {#include-filters}

This Windows _include-style_ example is based on the sync root (Path1)
set to `C:\Users\MyLogin`. The strategy is to select specific directories
to be synched with a network drive (Path2).

- `- /AppData/` excludes an entire tree of Windows stored stuff
  that need not be synched.
  In my case, AppData has >11 GB of stuff I don't care about, and there are
  some subdirectories beneath AppData that are not accessible to my
  user login, resulting in bisync critical aborts.
- Windows creates cache files starting with both upper and
  lowercase `NTUSER` at `C:\Users\MyLogin`. These files may be dynamic,
  locked, and are generally _don't care_.
- There are just a few directories with _my_ data that I do want synched,
  in the form of `+ /<path>`. By selecting only the directory trees I
  want to avoid the dozen plus directories that various apps make
  at `C:\Users\MyLogin\Documents`.
- Include files in the root of the sync point, `C:\Users\MyLogin`,
  by adding the `+ /*` line.
- This is an Include-style filters file, therefore it ends with `- **`
  which excludes everything not explicitly included.

```
- /AppData/
- NTUSER*
- ntuser*
+ /Documents/Family/**
+ /Documents/Sketchup/**
+ /Documents/Microcapture_Photo/**
+ /Documents/Microcapture_Video/**
+ /Desktop/**
+ /Pictures/**
+ /*
- **
```

Note also that Windows implements several "library" links such as
`C:\Users\MyLogin\My Documents\My Music` pointing to `C:\Users\MyLogin\Music`.
rclone sees these as links, so you must add `--links` to the
bisync command line if you which to follow these links. I find that I get
permission errors in trying to follow the links, so I don't include the
rclone `--links` flag, but then you get lots of `Can't follow symlink…`
noise from rclone about not following the links. This noise can be
quashed by adding `--quiet` to the bisync command line.

## Example exclude-style filters files for use with Dropbox {#exclude-filters}

- Dropbox disallows syncing the listed temporary and configuration/data files.
  The `- <filename>` filters exclude these files where ever they may occur
  in the sync tree. Consider adding similar exclusions for file types
  you don't need to sync, such as core dump and software build files.
- bisync testing creates `/testdir/` at the top level of the sync tree,
  and usually deletes the tree after the test. If a normal sync should run
  while the `/testdir/` tree exists the `--check-access` phase may fail
  due to unbalanced RCLONE_TEST files.
  The `- /testdir/` filter blocks this tree from being synched.
  You don't need this exclusion if you are not doing bisync development testing.
- Everything else beneath the Path1/Path2 root will be synched.
- RCLONE_TEST files may be placed anywhere within the tree, including the root.

### Example filters file for Dropbox {#example-filters-file}

- /testdir/

# Other example filters

#- /Photos/
```

### How --check-access handles filters

At the start of a bisync run, listings are gathered for Path1 and Path2
while using the user's `--filters-file`. During the check access phase,
bisync scans these listings for `RCLONE_TEST` files.
Any `RCLONE_TEST` files hidden by the `--filters-file` are _not_ in the
listings and thus not checked during the check access phase.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### Reading bisync logs

Here are two normal runs. The first one has a newer file on the remote.
The second has no deltas between local and remote.

```

2021/05/16 00:36:52 INFO  : Bisync successful
```

### Dry run oddity

The `--dry-run` messages may indicate that it would try to delete some files.
For example, if a file is new on Path2 and does not exist on Path1 then
it would normally be copied to Path1, but with `--dry-run` enabled those
copies don't happen, which leads to the attempted delete on Path2,
blocked again by --dry-run: `... Not deleting as --dry-run`.

This whole confusing situation is an artifact of the `--dry-run` flag.
Scrutinize the proposed deletes carefully, and if the files would have been
copied to Path1 then the threatened deletes on Path2 may be disregarded.

### Retries

Rclone has built-in retries. If you run with `--verbose` you'll see
error and retry messages such as shown below. This is usually not a bug.
If at the end of the run, you see `Bisync successful` and not
`Bisync critical error` or `Bisync aborted` then the run was successful,
and you can ignore the error messages.

The following run shows an intermittent fail. Lines _5_ and _6- are
low-level messages. Line _6_ is a bubbled-up _warning_ message, conveying
the error. Rclone normally retries failing commands, so there may be
numerous such messages in the log.

Since there are no final error/warning messages on line _7_, rclone has
recovered from failure after a retry, and the overall sync was successful.

```

```

This log shows a _Critical failure_ which requires a `--resync` to recover from.
See the [Runtime Error Handling](#error-handling) section.

```

### Denied downloads of "infected" or "abusive" files

Google Drive has a filter for certain file types (`.exe`, `.apk`, et cetera)
that by default cannot be copied from Google Drive to the local filesystem.
If you are having problems, run with `--verbose` to see specifically which
files are generating complaints. If the error is
`This file has been identified as malware or spam and cannot be downloaded`,
consider using the flag
[--drive-acknowledge-abuse](/drive/#drive-acknowledge-abuse).

### Google Docs (and other files of unknown size) {#gdocs}

As of `v1.66`, [Google Docs](/drive/#import-export-of-google-documents)
(including Google Sheets, Slides, etc.) are now supported in bisync, subject to
the same options, defaults, and limitations as in `rclone sync`. When bisyncing
drive with non-drive backends, the drive -> non-drive direction is controlled
by [`--drive-export-formats`](/drive/#drive-export-formats) (default
`"docx,xlsx,pptx,svg"`) and the non-drive -> drive direction is controlled by
[`--drive-import-formats`](/drive/#drive-import-formats) (default none.) 

For example, with the default export/import formats, a Google Sheet on the
drive side will be synced to an `.xlsx` file on the non-drive side. In the
reverse direction, `.xlsx` files with filenames that match an existing Google
Sheet will be synced to that Google Sheet, while `.xlsx` files that do NOT
match an existing Google Sheet will be copied to drive as normal `.xlsx` files
(without conversion to Sheets, although the Google Drive web browser UI may
still give you the option to open it as one.)

If `--drive-import-formats` is set (it's not, by default), then all of the
specified formats will be converted to Google Docs, if there is no existing
Google Doc with a matching name. Caution: such conversion can be quite lossy,
and in most cases it's probably not what you want!

To bisync Google Docs as URL shortcut links (in a manner similar to "Drive for
Desktop"), use: `--drive-export-formats url` (or
[alternatives](https://rclone.org/drive/#exportformats:~:text=available%20Google%20Documents.-,Extension,macOS,-Standard%20options).)

Note that these link files cannot be edited on the non-drive side -- you will
get errors if you try to sync an edited link file back to drive. They CAN be
deleted (it will result in deleting the corresponding Google Doc.) If you
create a `.url` file on the non-drive side that does not match an existing
Google Doc, bisyncing it will just result in copying the literal `.url` file
over to drive (no Google Doc will be created.) So, as a general rule of thumb,
think of them as read-only placeholders on the non-drive side, and make all
your changes on the drive side.

Likewise, even with other export-formats, it is best to only move/rename Google
Docs on the drive side. This is because otherwise, bisync will interpret this
as a file deleted and another created, and accordingly, it will delete the
Google Doc and create a new file at the new path. (Whether or not that new file
is a Google Doc depends on `--drive-import-formats`.)

Lastly, take note that all Google Docs on the drive side have a size of `-1`
and no checksum. Therefore, they cannot be reliably synced with the
`--checksum` or `--size-only` flags. (To be exact: they will still get
created/deleted, and bisync's delta engine will notice changes and queue them
for syncing, but the underlying sync function will consider them identical and
skip them.) To work around this, use the default (modtime and size) instead of
`--checksum` or `--size-only`.

To ignore Google Docs entirely, use
[`--drive-skip-gdocs`](/drive/#drive-skip-gdocs).

## Usage examples

### Cron {#cron}

Rclone does not yet have a built-in capability to monitor the local file
system for changes and must be blindly run periodically.
On Windows this can be done using a _Task Scheduler_,
on Linux you can use _Cron_ which is described below.

The 1st example runs a sync every 5 minutes between a local directory
and an OwnCloud server, with output logged to a runlog file:

```
# Minute (0-59)
#      Hour (0-23)
#           Day of Month (1-31)
#                Month (1-12 or Jan-Dec)
#                     Day of Week (0-6 or Sun-Sat)
#                         Command

If you run `rclone bisync` as a cron job, redirect stdout/stderr to a file.
The 2nd example runs a sync to Dropbox every hour and logs all stdout (via the `>>`)
and stderr (via `2>&1`) to a log file.

### Sharing an encrypted folder tree between hosts

bisync can keep a local folder in sync with a cloud service,
but what if you have some highly sensitive files to be synched?

Usage of a cloud service is for exchanging both routine and sensitive
personal files between one's home network, one's personal notebook when on the
road, and with one's work computer. The routine data is not sensitive.
For the sensitive data, configure an rclone [crypt remote](/crypt/) to point to
a subdirectory within the local disk tree that is bisync'd to Dropbox,
and then set up an bisync for this local crypt directory to a directory
outside of the main sync tree.

### Linux server setup

- `/path/to/DBoxroot` is the root of my local sync tree.
  There are numerous subdirectories.
- `/path/to/DBoxroot/crypt` is the root subdirectory for files
  that are encrypted. This local directory target is setup as an
  rclone crypt remote named `Dropcrypt:`.
  See [rclone.conf](#rclone-conf-snippet) snippet below.
- `/path/to/my/unencrypted/files` is the root of my sensitive
  files - not encrypted, not within the tree synched to Dropbox.
- To sync my local unencrypted files with the encrypted Dropbox versions
  I manually run `bisync /path/to/my/unencrypted/files DropCrypt:`.
  This step could be bundled into a script to run before and after
  the full Dropbox tree sync in the last step,
  thus actively keeping the sensitive files in sync.
- `bisync /path/to/DBoxroot Dropbox:` runs periodically via cron,
  keeping my full local sync tree in sync with Dropbox.

### Windows notebook setup

- The Dropbox client runs keeping the local tree `C:\Users\MyLogin\Dropbox`
  always in sync with Dropbox. I could have used `rclone bisync` instead.
- A separate directory tree at `C:\Users\MyLogin\Documents\DropLocal`
  hosts the tree of unencrypted files/folders.
- To sync my local unencrypted files with the encrypted
  Dropbox versions I manually run the following command:
  `rclone bisync C:\Users\MyLogin\Documents\DropLocal Dropcrypt:`.
- The Dropbox client then syncs the changes with Dropbox.

### rclone.conf snippet {#rclone-conf-snippet}

## Testing {#testing}

You should read this section only if you are developing for rclone.
You need to have rclone source code locally to work with bisync tests.

Bisync has a dedicated test framework implemented in the `bisync_test.go`
file located in the rclone source tree. The test suite is based on the
`go test` command. Series of tests are stored in subdirectories below the
`cmd/bisync/testdata` directory. Individual tests can be invoked by their
directory name, e.g.
`go test . -case basic -remote local -remote2 gdrive: -v`

Tests will make a temporary folder on remote and purge it afterwards.
If during test run there are intermittent errors and rclone retries,
these errors will be captured and flagged as invalid MISCOMPAREs.
Rerunning the test will let it pass. Consider such failures as noise.

### Test command syntax

```
usage: go test ./cmd/bisync [options...]

Options:
  -case NAME        Name(s) of the test case(s) to run. Multiple names should
                    be separated by commas. You can remove the `test_` prefix
                    and replace `_` by `-` in test name for convenience.
                    If not `all`, the name(s) should map to a directory under
                    `./cmd/bisync/testdata`.
                    Use `all` to run all tests (default: all)
  -remote PATH1     `local` or name of cloud service with `:` (default: local)
  -remote2 PATH2    `local` or name of cloud service with `:` (default: local)
  -no-compare       Disable comparing test results with the golden directory
                    (default: compare)
  -no-cleanup       Disable cleanup of Path1 and Path2 testdirs.
                    Useful for troubleshooting. (default: cleanup)
  -golden           Store results in the golden directory (default: false)
                    This flag can be used with multiple tests.
  -debug            Print debug messages
  -stop-at NUM      Stop test after given step number. (default: run to the end)
                    Implies `-no-compare` and `-no-cleanup`, if the test really
                    ends prematurely. Only meaningful for a single test case.
  -refresh-times    Force refreshing the target modtime, useful for Dropbox
                    (default: false)
  -verbose          Run tests verbosely
```

Note: unlike rclone flags which must be prefixed by double dash (`--`), the
test command flags can be equally prefixed by a single `-` or double dash.

### Running tests

- `go test . -case basic -remote local -remote2 local`
  runs the `test_basic` test case using only the local filesystem,
  syncing one local directory with another local directory.
  Test script output is to the console, while commands within scenario.txt
  have their output sent to the `.../workdir/test.log` file,
  which is finally compared to the golden copy.
- The first argument after `go test` should be a relative name of the
  directory containing bisync source code. If you run tests right from there,
  the argument will be `.` (current directory) as in most examples below.
  If you run bisync tests from the rclone source directory, the command
  should be `go test ./cmd/bisync ...`.
- The test engine will mangle rclone output to ensure comparability
  with golden listings and logs.
- Test scenarios are located in `./cmd/bisync/testdata`. The test `-case`
  argument should match the full name of a subdirectory under that
  directory. Every test subdirectory name on disk must start with `test_`,
  this prefix can be omitted on command line for brevity. Also, underscores
  in the name can be replaced by dashes for convenience.
- `go test . -remote local -remote2 local -case all` runs all tests.
- Path1 and Path2 may either be the keyword `local`
  or may be names of configured cloud services.
  `go test . -remote gdrive: -remote2 dropbox: -case basic`
  will run the test between these two services, without transferring
  any files to the local filesystem.
- Test run stdout and stderr console output may be directed to a file, e.g.
  `go test . -remote gdrive: -remote2 local -case all > runlog.txt 2>&1`

### Test execution flow

1. The base setup in the `initial` directory of the testcase is applied
   on the Path1 and Path2 filesystems (via rclone copy the initial directory
   to Path1, then rclone sync Path1 to Path2).
2. The commands in the scenario.txt file are applied, with output directed
   to the `test.log` file in the test working directory.
   Typically, the first actual command in the `scenario.txt` file is
   to do a `--resync`, which establishes the baseline
   `{...}.path1.lst` and `{...}.path2.lst` files in the test working
   directory (`.../workdir/` relative to the temporary test directory).
   Various commands and listing snapshots are done within the test.
3. Finally, the contents of the test working directory are compared
   to the contents of the testcase's golden directory.

### Notes about testing

- Test cases are in individual directories beneath `./cmd/bisync/testdata`.
  A command line reference to a test is understood to reference a directory
  beneath `testdata`. For example,
  `go test ./cmd/bisync -case dry-run -remote gdrive: -remote2 local`
  refers to the test case in `./cmd/bisync/testdata/test_dry_run`.
- The test working directory is located at `.../workdir` relative to a
  temporary test directory, usually under `/tmp` on Linux.
- The local test sync tree is created at a temporary directory named
  like `bisync.XXX` under system temporary directory.
- The remote test sync tree is located at a temporary directory
  under `<remote:>/bisync.XXX/`.
- `path1` and/or `path2` subdirectories are created in a temporary
  directory under the respective local or cloud test remote.
- By default, the Path1 and Path2 test dirs and workdir will be deleted
  after each test run. The `-no-cleanup` flag disables purging these
  directories when validating and debugging a given test.
  These directories will be flushed before running another test,
  independent of the `-no-cleanup` usage.
- You will likely want to add `- /testdir/` to your normal
  bisync `--filters-file` so that normal syncs do not attempt to sync
  the test temporary directories, which may have `RCLONE_TEST` miscompares
  in some testcases which would otherwise trip the `--check-access` system.
  The `--check-access` mechanism is hard-coded to ignore `RCLONE_TEST`
  files beneath `bisync/testdata`, so the test cases may reside on the
  synched tree even if there are check file mismatches in the test tree.
- Some Dropbox tests can fail, notably printing the following message:
  `src and dst identical but can't set mod time without deleting and re-uploading`
  This is expected and happens due to the way Dropbox handles modification times.
  You should use the `-refresh-times` test flag to make up for this.
- If Dropbox tests hit request limit for you and print error message
  `too_many_requests/...: Too many requests or write operations.`
  then follow the
  [Dropbox App ID instructions](/dropbox/#get-your-own-dropbox-app-id).

### Updating golden results

Sometimes even a slight change in the bisync source can cause little changes
spread around many log files. Updating them manually would be a nightmare.

The `-golden` flag will store the `test.log` and `*.lst` listings from each
test case into respective golden directories. Golden results will
automatically contain generic strings instead of local or cloud paths which
means that they should match when run with a different cloud service.

Your normal workflow might be as follows:
1. Git-clone the rclone sources locally
2. Modify bisync source and check that it builds
3. Run the whole test suite `go test ./cmd/bisync -remote local`
4. If some tests show log difference, recheck them individually, e.g.:
   `go test ./cmd/bisync -remote local -case basic`
5. If you are convinced with the difference, goldenize all tests at once:
   `go test ./cmd/bisync -remote local -golden`
6. Use word diff: `git diff --word-diff ./cmd/bisync/testdata/`.
   Please note that normal line-level diff is generally useless here.
7. Check the difference _carefully_!
8. Commit the change (`git commit`) _only_ if you are sure.
   If unsure, save your code changes then wipe the log diffs from git:
   `git reset [--hard]`.

### Structure of test scenarios

- `<testname>/initial/` contains a tree of files that will be set
  as the initial condition on both Path1 and Path2 testdirs.
- `<testname>/modfiles/` contains files that will be used to
  modify the Path1 and/or Path2 filesystems.
- `<testname>/golden/` contains the expected content of the test
  working directory (`workdir`) at the completion of the testcase.
- `<testname>/scenario.txt` contains the body of the test, in the form of
  various commands to modify files, run bisync, and snapshot listings.
  Output from these commands is captured to `.../workdir/test.log`
  for comparison to the golden files.

### Supported test commands

- `test <some message>`
  Print the line to the console and to the `test.log`:
  `test sync is working correctly with options x, y, z`
- `copy-listings <prefix>`
  Save a copy of all `.lst` listings in the test working directory
  with the specified prefix:
  `save-listings exclude-pass-run`
- `move-listings <prefix>`
  Similar to `copy-listings` but removes the source
- `purge-children <dir>`
  This will delete all child files and purge all child subdirs under given
  directory but keep the parent intact. This behavior is important for tests
  with Google Drive because removing and re-creating the parent would change
  its ID.
- `delete-file <file>`
  Delete a single file.
- `delete-glob <dir> <pattern>`
  Delete a group of files located one level deep in the given directory
  with names matching a given glob pattern.
- `touch-glob YYYY-MM-DD <dir> <pattern>`
  Change modification time on a group of files.
- `touch-copy YYYY-MM-DD <source-file> <dest-dir>`
  Change file modification time then copy it to destination.
- `copy-file <source-file> <dest-dir>`
  Copy a single file to given directory.
- `copy-as <source-file> <dest-file>`
  Similar to above but destination must include both directory
  and the new file name at destination.
- `copy-dir <src> <dst>` and `sync-dir <src> <dst>`
  Copy/sync a directory. Equivalent of `rclone copy` and `rclone sync`.
- `list-dirs <dir>`
  Equivalent to `rclone lsf -R --dirs-only <dir>`
- `bisync [options]`
  Runs bisync against `-remote` and `-remote2`.

### Supported substitution terms

- `{testdir/}` - the root dir of the testcase
- `{datadir/}` - the `modfiles` dir under the testcase root
- `{workdir/}` - the temporary test working directory
- `{path1/}` - the root of the Path1 test directory tree
- `{path2/}` - the root of the Path2 test directory tree
- `{session}` - base name of the test listings
- `{/}` - OS-specific path separator
- `{spc}`, `{tab}`, `{eol}` - whitespace
- `{chr:HH}` - raw byte with given hexadecimal code

Substitution results of the terms named like `{dir/}` will end with
`/` (or backslash on Windows), so it is not necessary to include
slash in the usage, for example `delete-file {path1/}file1.txt`.

## Benchmarks

_This section is work in progress._

Here are a few data points for scale, execution times, and memory usage.

The first set of data was taken between a local disk to Dropbox.
The [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net) download speed was ~170 Mbps,
and upload speed was ~10 Mbps. 500 files (~9.5 MB each) had been already
synched. 50 files were added in a new directory, each ~9.5 MB, ~475 MB total.

Change                                | Operations and times                                   | Overall run time
--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------
500 files synched (nothing to move)   | 1x listings for Path1 & Path2                          | 1.5 sec
500 files synched with --check-access | 1x listings for Path1 & Path2                          | 1.5 sec
50 new files on remote                | Queued 50 copies down: 27 sec                          |  29 sec
Moved local dir                       | Queued 50 copies up: 410 sec, 50 deletes up: 9 sec     | 421 sec
Moved remote dir                      | Queued 50 copies down: 31 sec, 50 deletes down: <1 sec |  33 sec
Delete local dir                      | Queued 50 deletes up: 9 sec                            |  13 sec

This next data is from a user's application. They had ~400GB of data
over 1.96 million files being sync'ed between a Windows local disk and some
remote cloud. The file full path length was on average 35 characters
(which factors into load time and RAM required).

- Loading the prior listing into memory (1.96 million files, listing file
  size 140 MB) took ~30 sec and occupied about 1 GB of RAM.
- Getting a fresh listing of the local file system (producing the
  140 MB output file) took about XXX sec.
- Getting a fresh listing of the remote file system (producing the 140 MB
  output file) took about XXX sec. The network download speed was measured
  at XXX Mb/s.
- Once the prior and current Path1 and Path2 listings were loaded (a total
  of four to be loaded, two at a time), determining the deltas was pretty
  quick (a few seconds for this test case), and the transfer time for any
  files to be copied was dominated by the network bandwidth.

## References

rclone's bisync implementation was derived from
the [rclonesync-V2](https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2) project,
including documentation and test mechanisms,
with [@cjnaz](https://github.com/cjnaz)'s full support and encouragement.

`rclone bisync` is similar in nature to a range of other projects:

- [unison](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison)
- [syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing)
- [cjnaz/rclonesync](https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2)
- [ConorWilliams/rsinc](https://github.com/ConorWilliams/rsinc)
- [jwink3101/syncrclone](https://github.com/Jwink3101/syncrclone)
- [DavideRossi/upback](https://github.com/DavideRossi/upback)

Bisync adopts the differential synchronization technique, which is
based on keeping history of changes performed by both synchronizing sides.
See the _Dual Shadow Method_ section in
[Neil Fraser's article](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/sync/).

Also note a number of academic publications by
[Benjamin Pierce](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7Ebcpierce/papers/index.shtml#File%20Synchronization)
about _Unison_ and synchronization in general.

## Changelog

### `v1.69.1`
* Fixed an issue causing listings to not capture concurrent modifications under certain conditions

### `v1.68`
* Fixed an issue affecting backends that round modtimes to a lower precision.

### `v1.67`
* Added integration tests against all backends.

### `v1.66`
* Copies and deletes are now handled in one operation instead of two
* `--track-renames` and `--backup-dir` are now supported
* Partial uploads known issue on `local`/`ftp`/`sftp` has been resolved (unless using `--inplace`)
* Final listings are now generated from sync results, to avoid needing to re-list
* Bisync is now much more resilient to changes that happen during a bisync run, and far less prone to critical errors / undetected changes
* Bisync is now capable of rolling a file listing back in cases of uncertainty, essentially marking the file as needing to be rechecked next time.
* A few basic terminal colors are now supported, controllable with [`--color`](/docs/#color) (`AUTO`|`NEVER`|`ALWAYS`)
* Initial listing snapshots of Path1 and Path2 are now generated concurrently, using the same "march" infrastructure as `check` and `sync`,
for performance improvements and less [risk of error](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=4.%20Listings%20should%20alternate%20between%20paths%20to%20minimize%20errors).
* Fixed handling of unicode normalization and case insensitivity, support for [`--fix-case`](/docs/#fix-case), [`--ignore-case-sync`](/docs/#ignore-case-sync), [`--no-unicode-normalization`](/docs/#no-unicode-normalization)
* `--resync` is now much more efficient (especially for users of `--create-empty-src-dirs`)
* Google Docs (and other files of unknown size) are now supported (with the same options as in `sync`)

* A new `--max-lock` setting allows lock files to automatically renew and expire, for better automatic recovery when a run is interrupted.
* Bisync now supports auto-resolving sync conflicts and customizing rename behavior with new [`--conflict-resolve`](#conflict-resolve), [`--conflict-loser`](#conflict-loser), and [`--conflict-suffix`](#conflict-suffix) flags.
* A new [`--resync-mode`](#resync-mode) flag allows more control over which version of a file gets kept during a `--resync`.
* Bisync now supports [`--retries`](/docs/#retries-int) and [`--retries-sleep`](/docs/#retries-sleep-time) (when [`--resilient`](#resilient) is set.)
