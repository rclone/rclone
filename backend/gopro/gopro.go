- file_size is always null for these - this backend reports their
  size as unknown (like a chaptered video or burst photo set) rather
  than skipping them, so [--gopro-read-size](#gopro-read-size) is
  needed for an exact size (e.g. for rclone mount).

  serves the rendered video (the "baked_source" rendition) for these,
  not the EDL, and this backend's Content-Type follows the filename's
  own extension (usually ".mp4") to match what's actually served.

confirmed case, its camera-original file) available while

extra rendition (proxies, thumbnails) GoPro generates is also done,
not that the medium is otherwise unusable before then. That's not
confirmed for every state this option adds, though - a medium with no
usable file_size yet (still true for at least "uploading" and

bring it back - see [--gopro-trashed-only](#gopro-trashed-only)),

GoPro's own web/app default ("delete" there is also recoverable) -
safer than a mistaken or scripted delete being unrecoverable by
default. Set to false to skip the trash and delete permanently
instead - matches what "rclone delete" usually means on backends
without a trash concept at all. This costs nothing extra for
GoPro-branded camera media specifically: it's "exempt" from any
storage quota ("Unlimited Storage" in the account dashboard), so
there's no space to reclaim by skipping the trash either way.
Anything uploaded here that isn't GoPro-camera footage is
"non_exempt" and capped instead ("Additional Storage: x/100GB" in

Matches the drive backend's --drive-trashed-only: with this on, every
listing under media/ shows what's currently in GoPro's "Recently
Deleted" (see [--gopro-use-trash](#gopro-use-trash)) instead of the
active library, so it can be inspected or copied out before GoPro
auto-purges it (confirmed live, roughly 60 days after deletion).

GET /media/deleted (what this reads from) doesn't support the same
server-side type or date-range filtering /media/search does -
confirmed live, it always returns the entire trash regardless of
these parameters - so this backend fetches the whole trash to narrow
down even a single media/by-year, media/by-month or media/by-day
listing. That fetch is cached in memory for a few minutes, so only the
first trashed listing in a given run pays for it - the rest, however
many different by-year/by-month/by-day views they ask for, are free.

Every trashed item is shown, regardless of
[--gopro-include-edits](#gopro-include-edits),
[--gopro-include-processing](#gopro-include-processing),
[--gopro-include-failed](#gopro-include-failed) or an unusable
file_size - matching GoPro's own web/app "Recently Deleted" view, which
applies none of its own library's filters either. The only things you
can do with a trashed item are restore it or delete it for good, so
there's no browsing-safety reason to hide any of it the way this
backend hides an unfinished or unrecognised item from the active
library by default.

This changes what every listing shows, not just one path - use an
on-the-fly connection string (e.g. ":gopro,trashed_only=true:media/all")
rather than setting it globally in the remote's config if a normal,
non-trashed view of the same remote is still needed side by side. To
restore trashed media back to the active library, see "rclone backend
restore".

Deleting a file shown here (e.g. via "rclone delete") always purges it
permanently, regardless of --gopro-use-trash - confirmed live, GoPro's
API rejects a second ordinary delete on a medium that's already in the
trash, so there is nothing "soft" left to do to it.`,

Without this, a file only gets its GoPro media ID appended to its name
when it collides with another file of the same name in the same
listing - but GoPro cameras recycle filenames constantly, so whether a
given file collides depends on what else happens to exist at listing
time, which can change from one run to the next with no change to the
file itself. That makes a plain name unstable: a file uploaded earlier
under "GX010123.MP4" can silently become "GX010123 {id}.MP4" the
moment a second "GX010123.MP4" turns up elsewhere in the library, and
rclone has no way to know the two names refer to the same file -
"sync" would delete and re-transfer it under the new name, and "copy"
would leave a stale duplicate behind under the old one, forever.

On by default because that failure mode is silent and only shows up
intermittently, on whichever run happens to introduce a colliding
name - a normal-looking successful sync/copy today doesn't mean this
won't bite on some future run. Turn it off only if you want clean
names and are confident this library won't hit a same-name collision
(a small, static library of hand-picked clips, say), or don't mind the

file_size from the search API can be wrong - confirmed live, a few KB
larger than the size actually served, specifically for a video whose
"source" rendition had been moved to colder S3 storage. A wrong size
here does more than look odd: it fails rclone's post-transfer
integrity check (discarding an otherwise-complete download and
restarting it), can corrupt rclone's multi-thread downloader (which
divides a file into ranged chunks using this size before the transfer
starts), and makes "sync" re-download an already-correct file on every
single run, since the sizes would never match.

GoPro's API exposes no storage class or anything else that reliably
predicts which files are affected - checked live, colder storage alone
isn't enough, most files there still report their size correctly. The
one thing a live account probe did find in common with the one
affected file, out of hundreds checked, is that GoPro had reprocessed
it after upload (a non-null reprocessed_at). That's a single data

library - confirmed live, undocumented API. It always operates on the
trash regardless of --gopro-trashed-only, since there would otherwise be
no way to run it without reconfiguring the remote first.

With no arguments, it restores everything currently in the trash:

    rclone backend restore gopro:

Given one or more arguments, each one names a single medium to restore
instead - either a bare id, or a trashed listing's own "name {id}.ext"
leaf (see --gopro-trashed-only and --gopro-always-add-id) pasted straight
from "rclone lsf":

    rclone backend restore gopro: 6a99f18a239bf36f4c2377cf "photo {6a99f18a239bf36f4c2377cf}.jpg"

Nothing is restored if --dry-run is set; the command logs what would be
restored instead.

GoPro's API accepts the request (202 Accepted) before actually
restoring anything - confirmed live, this backend's own cache is
updated straight away, but GoPro's side can lag behind that, and for a
handful of media that had sat in trash across several sessions it
never completed at all even minutes later and after being retried,
with no error to explain why. Re-check with --gopro-trashed-only if a
restored item doesn't show up in the active library right away.`,
