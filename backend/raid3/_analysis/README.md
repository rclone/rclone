# RAID3 Analysis Documents

This directory contains analysis, planning, and research documents for the RAID3 backend implementation.

**Note**: This directory is excluded from git commits (see `.gitignore`). Documents here are for local reference and planning purposes only.

## Directory Structure

- `performance/` - Performance analysis and optimization plans
- `design/` - Design decisions and architectural analysis
- `plans/` - Implementation plans and task breakdowns

## Purpose

This directory is intended for:
- Performance analysis and profiling results
- Design exploration and decision documentation
- Implementation planning and task tracking
- Research and investigation notes
- Temporary analysis that may not be ready for committed documentation

## When to Use This vs `docs/`

- **`_analysis/`**: Local-only analysis, work-in-progress, temporary research
- **`docs/`**: Committed documentation, final decisions, user-facing docs

If analysis matures into final documentation or design decisions, consider moving it to `docs/` for version control.
