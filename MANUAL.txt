About rclone

Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. It is
a feature-rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage interfaces.
Over 40 cloud storage products support rclone including S3 object
stores, business & consumer file storage services, as well as standard
transfer protocols.

Rclone has powerful cloud equivalents to the unix commands rsync, cp,
mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat. Rclone's familiar syntax
includes shell pipeline support, and --dry-run protection. It is used at
the command line, in scripts or via its API.

Users call rclone "The Swiss army knife of cloud storage", and
"Technology indistinguishable from magic".

Rclone really looks after your data. It preserves timestamps and
verifies checksums at all times. Transfers over limited bandwidth;
intermittent connections, or subject to quota can be restarted, from the
last good file transferred. You can check the integrity of your files.
Where possible, rclone employs server-side transfers to minimise local
bandwidth use and transfers from one provider to another without using
local disk.

Virtual backends wrap local and cloud file systems to apply encryption,
compression, chunking, hashing and joining.

Rclone mounts any local, cloud or virtual filesystem as a disk on
Windows, macOS, linux and FreeBSD, and also serves these over SFTP,
HTTP, WebDAV, FTP and DLNA.

Rclone is mature, open-source software originally inspired by rsync and
written in Go. The friendly support community is familiar with varied
use cases. Official Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Brew and Chocolatey repos.
include rclone. For the latest version downloading from rclone.org is
recommended.

Rclone is widely used on Linux, Windows and Mac. Third-party developers
create innovative backup, restore, GUI and business process solutions
using the rclone command line or API.

Rclone does the heavy lifting of communicating with cloud storage.

What can rclone do for you?

Rclone helps you:

-   Backup (and encrypt) files to cloud storage
-   Restore (and decrypt) files from cloud storage
-   Mirror cloud data to other cloud services or locally
-   Migrate data to the cloud, or between cloud storage vendors
-   Mount multiple, encrypted, cached or diverse cloud storage as a disk
-   Analyse and account for data held on cloud storage using lsf, ljson,
    size, ncdu
-   Union file systems together to present multiple local and/or cloud
    file systems as one

Install

Rclone is a Go program and comes as a single binary file.

Quickstart

-   Download the relevant binary.
-   Extract the rclone executable, rclone.exe on Windows, from the
    archive.
-   Run rclone config to setup. See rclone config docs for more details.
-   Optionally configure automatic execution.

See below for some expanded Linux / macOS instructions.

See the usage docs for how to use rclone, or run rclone -h.

Already installed rclone can be easily updated to the latest version
using the rclone selfupdate command.

Script installation

To install rclone on Linux/macOS/BSD systems, run:

    curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash

For beta installation, run:

    curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash -s beta

Note that this script checks the version of rclone installed first and
won't re-download if not needed.

Linux installation from precompiled binary

Fetch and unpack

    curl -O https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
    unzip rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
    cd rclone-*-linux-amd64

Copy binary file

    sudo cp rclone /usr/bin/
    sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/rclone
    sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/rclone

Install manpage

    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man1
    sudo cp rclone.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/
    sudo mandb

Run rclone config to setup. See rclone config docs for more details.

    rclone config

macOS installation with brew

    brew install rclone

NOTE: This version of rclone will not support mount any more (see
#5373). If mounting is wanted on macOS, either install a precompiled
binary or enable the relevant option when installing from source.

macOS installation from precompiled binary, using curl

To avoid problems with macOS gatekeeper enforcing the binary to be
signed and notarized it is enough to download with curl.

Download the latest version of rclone.

    cd && curl -O https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-osx-amd64.zip

Unzip the download and cd to the extracted folder.

    unzip -a rclone-current-osx-amd64.zip && cd rclone-*-osx-amd64

Move rclone to your $PATH. You will be prompted for your password.

    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
    sudo mv rclone /usr/local/bin/

(the mkdir command is safe to run, even if the directory already
exists).

Remove the leftover files.

    cd .. && rm -rf rclone-*-osx-amd64 rclone-current-osx-amd64.zip

Run rclone config to setup. See rclone config docs for more details.

    rclone config

macOS installation from precompiled binary, using a web browser

When downloading a binary with a web browser, the browser will set the
macOS gatekeeper quarantine attribute. Starting from Catalina, when
attempting to run rclone, a pop-up will appear saying:

    “rclone” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
    macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.

The simplest fix is to run

    xattr -d com.apple.quarantine rclone

Install with docker

The rclone maintains a docker image for rclone. These images are
autobuilt by docker hub from the rclone source based on a minimal Alpine
linux image.

The :latest tag will always point to the latest stable release. You can
use the :beta tag to get the latest build from master. You can also use
version tags, e.g. :1.49.1, :1.49 or :1.

    $ docker pull rclone/rclone:latest
    latest: Pulling from rclone/rclone
    Digest: sha256:0e0ced72671989bb837fea8e88578b3fc48371aa45d209663683e24cfdaa0e11
    ...
    $ docker run --rm rclone/rclone:latest version
    rclone v1.49.1
    - os/arch: linux/amd64
    - go version: go1.12.9

There are a few command line options to consider when starting an rclone
Docker container from the rclone image.

-   You need to mount the host rclone config dir at /config/rclone into
    the Docker container. Due to the fact that rclone updates tokens
    inside its config file, and that the update process involves a file
    rename, you need to mount the whole host rclone config dir, not just
    the single host rclone config file.

-   You need to mount a host data dir at /data into the Docker
    container.

-   By default, the rclone binary inside a Docker container runs with
    UID=0 (root). As a result, all files created in a run will have
    UID=0. If your config and data files reside on the host with a
    non-root UID:GID, you need to pass these on the container start
    command line.

-   If you want to access the RC interface (either via the API or the
    Web UI), it is required to set the --rc-addr to :5572 in order to
    connect to it from outside the container. An explanation about why
    this is necessary is present here.

    -   NOTE: Users running this container with the docker network set
        to host should probably set it to listen to localhost only, with
        127.0.0.1:5572 as the value for --rc-addr

-   It is possible to use rclone mount inside a userspace Docker
    container, and expose the resulting fuse mount to the host. The
    exact docker run options to do that might vary slightly between
    hosts. See, e.g. the discussion in this thread.

    You also need to mount the host /etc/passwd and /etc/group for fuse
    to work inside the container.

Here are some commands tested on an Ubuntu 18.04.3 host:

    # config on host at ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
    # data on host at ~/data

    # make sure the config is ok by listing the remotes
    docker run --rm \
        --volume ~/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \
        --volume ~/data:/data:shared \
        --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
        rclone/rclone \
        listremotes

    # perform mount inside Docker container, expose result to host
    mkdir -p ~/data/mount
    docker run --rm \
        --volume ~/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \
        --volume ~/data:/data:shared \
        --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
        --volume /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro --volume /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \
        --device /dev/fuse --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --security-opt apparmor:unconfined \
        rclone/rclone \
        mount dropbox:Photos /data/mount &
    ls ~/data/mount
    kill %1

Install from source

Make sure you have at least Go go1.15 installed. Download go if
necessary. The latest release is recommended. Then

    git clone https://github.com/rclone/rclone.git
    cd rclone
    go build
    # If on macOS and mount is wanted, instead run: make GOTAGS=cmount
    ./rclone version

This will leave you a checked out version of rclone you can modify and
send pull requests with. If you use make instead of go build then the
rclone build will have the correct version information in it.

You can also build the latest stable rclone with:

    go get github.com/rclone/rclone

or the latest version (equivalent to the beta) with

    go get github.com/rclone/rclone@master

These will build the binary in $(go env GOPATH)/bin (~/go/bin/rclone by
default) after downloading the source to the go module cache. Note - do
not use the -u flag here. This causes go to try to update the
dependencies that rclone uses and sometimes these don't work with the
current version of rclone.

Installation with Ansible

This can be done with Stefan Weichinger's ansible role.

Instructions

1.  git clone https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone.git
    into your local roles-directory
2.  add the role to the hosts you want rclone installed to:

        - hosts: rclone-hosts
          roles:
              - rclone

Portable installation

As mentioned above, rclone is single executable (rclone, or rclone.exe
on Windows) that you can download as a zip archive and extract into a
location of your choosing. When executing different commands, it may
create files in different locations, such as a configuration file and
various temporary files. By default the locations for these are
according to your operating system, e.g. configuration file in your user
profile directory and temporary files in the standard temporary
directory, but you can customize all of them, e.g. to make a completely
self-contained, portable installation.

Run the config paths command to see the locations that rclone will use.

To override them set the corresponding options (as command-line
arguments, or as environment variables): - --config - --cache-dir -
--temp-dir

Autostart

After installing and configuring rclone, as described above, you are
ready to use rclone as an interactive command line utility. If your goal
is to perform periodic operations, such as a regular sync, you will
probably want to configure your rclone command in your operating
system's scheduler. If you need to expose service-like features, such as
remote control, GUI, serve or mount, you will often want an rclone
command always running in the background, and configuring it to run in a
service infrastructure may be a better option. Below are some
alternatives on how to achieve this on different operating systems.

NOTE: Before setting up autorun it is highly recommended that you have
tested your command manually from a Command Prompt first.

Autostart on Windows

The most relevant alternatives for autostart on Windows are: - Run at
user log on using the Startup folder - Run at user log on, at system
startup or at schedule using Task Scheduler - Run at system startup
using Windows service

Running in background

Rclone is a console application, so if not starting from an existing
Command Prompt, e.g. when starting rclone.exe from a shortcut, it will
open a Command Prompt window. When configuring rclone to run from task
scheduler and windows service you are able to set it to run hidden in
background. From rclone version 1.54 you can also make it run hidden
from anywhere by adding option --no-console (it may still flash briefly
when the program starts). Since rclone normally writes information and
any error messages to the console, you must redirect this to a file to
be able to see it. Rclone has a built-in option --log-file for that.

Example command to run a sync in background:

    c:\rclone\rclone.exe sync c:\files remote:/files --no-console --log-file c:\rclone\logs\sync_files.txt

User account

As mentioned in the mount documentation, mounted drives created as
Administrator are not visible to other accounts, not even the account
that was elevated as Administrator. By running the mount command as the
built-in SYSTEM user account, it will create drives accessible for
everyone on the system. Both scheduled task and Windows service can be
used to achieve this.

NOTE: Remember that when rclone runs as the SYSTEM user, the user
profile that it sees will not be yours. This means that if you normally
run rclone with configuration file in the default location, to be able
to use the same configuration when running as the system user you must
explicitely tell rclone where to find it with the --config option, or
else it will look in the system users profile path
(C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile). To test your command
manually from a Command Prompt, you can run it with the PsExec utility
from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite, which takes option -s to execute
commands as the SYSTEM user.

Start from Startup folder

To quickly execute an rclone command you can simply create a standard
Windows Explorer shortcut for the complete rclone command you want to
run. If you store this shortcut in the special "Startup" start-menu
folder, Windows will automatically run it at login. To open this folder
in Windows Explorer, enter path
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup, or
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp if you want
the command to start for every user that logs in.

This is the easiest approach to autostarting of rclone, but it offers no
functionality to set it to run as different user, or to set conditions
or actions on certain events. Setting up a scheduled task as described
below will often give you better results.

Start from Task Scheduler

Task Scheduler is an administrative tool built into Windows, and it can
be used to configure rclone to be started automatically in a highly
configurable way, e.g. periodically on a schedule, on user log on, or at
system startup. It can run be configured to run as the current user, or
for a mount command that needs to be available to all users it can run
as the SYSTEM user. For technical information, see
https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/taskschd/task-scheduler-start-page.

Run as service

For running rclone at system startup, you can create a Windows service
that executes your rclone command, as an alternative to scheduled task
configured to run at startup.

Mount command built-in service integration

For mount commands, Rclone has a built-in Windows service integration
via the third-party WinFsp library it uses. Registering as a regular
Windows service easy, as you just have to execute the built-in
PowerShell command New-Service (requires administrative privileges).

Example of a PowerShell command that creates a Windows service for
mounting some remote:/files as drive letter X:, for all users (service
will be running as the local system account):

    New-Service -Name Rclone -BinaryPathName 'c:\rclone\rclone.exe mount remote:/files X: --config c:\rclone\config\rclone.conf --log-file c:\rclone\logs\mount.txt'

The WinFsp service infrastructure supports incorporating services for
file system implementations, such as rclone, into its own launcher
service, as kind of "child services". This has the additional advantage
that it also implements a network provider that integrates into Windows
standard methods for managing network drives. This is currently not
officially supported by Rclone, but with WinFsp version 2019.3 B2 /
v1.5B2 or later it should be possible through path rewriting as
described here.

Third-party service integration

To Windows service running any rclone command, the excellent third-party
utility NSSM, the "Non-Sucking Service Manager", can be used. It
includes some advanced features such as adjusting process periority,
defining process environment variables, redirect to file anything
written to stdout, and customized response to different exit codes, with
a GUI to configure everything from (although it can also be used from
command line ).

There are also several other alternatives. To mention one more, WinSW,
"Windows Service Wrapper", is worth checking out. It requires .NET
Framework, but it is preinstalled on newer versions of Windows, and it
also provides alternative standalone distributions which includes
necessary runtime (.NET 5). WinSW is a command-line only utility, where
you have to manually create an XML file with service configuration. This
may be a drawback for some, but it can also be an advantage as it is
easy to back up and re-use the configuration settings, without having go
through manual steps in a GUI. One thing to note is that by default it
does not restart the service on error, one have to explicit enable this
in the configuration file (via the "onfailure" parameter).

Autostart on Linux

Start as a service

To always run rclone in background, relevant for mount commands etc, you
can use systemd to set up rclone as a system or user service. Running as
a system service ensures that it is run at startup even if the user it
is running as has no active session. Running rclone as a user service
ensures that it only starts after the configured user has logged into
the system.

Run periodically from cron

To run a periodic command, such as a copy/sync, you can set up a cron
job.

Usage

Rclone is a command line program to manage files on cloud storage. After
download and install, continue here to learn how to use it: Initial
configuration, what the basic syntax looks like, describes the various
subcommands, the various options, and more.

Configure

First, you'll need to configure rclone. As the object storage systems
have quite complicated authentication these are kept in a config file.
(See the --config entry for how to find the config file and choose its
location.)

The easiest way to make the config is to run rclone with the config
option:

Basic syntax

Rclone syncs a directory tree from one storage system to another.

Its syntax is like this

    Syntax: [options] subcommand <parameters> <parameters...>

Source and destination paths are specified by the name you gave the
storage system in the config file then the sub path, e.g.
"drive:myfolder" to look at "myfolder" in Google drive.

You can define as many storage paths as you like in the config file.

Please use the -i / --interactive flag while learning rclone to avoid
accidental data loss.

Subcommands

rclone uses a system of subcommands. For example

    rclone ls remote:path # lists a remote
    rclone copy /local/path remote:path # copies /local/path to the remote
    rclone sync -i /local/path remote:path # syncs /local/path to the remote

rclone config

Enter an interactive configuration session.

Synopsis

Enter an interactive configuration session where you can setup new
remotes and manage existing ones. You may also set or remove a password
to protect your configuration.

    rclone config [flags]

Options

      -h, --help   help for config

See the global flags page for global options not listed here.

rclone copy

Copy files from source to dest, skipping identical files.

Synopsis

Copy the source to the destination. Does not transfer files that are
identical on source and destination, testing by size and modification
time or MD5SUM. Doesn't delete files from the destination.

Note that it is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not
the directory so when source:path is a directory, it's the contents of
source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.

If dest:path doesn't exist, it is created and the source:path contents
go there.

For example

    rclone copy source:sourcepath dest:destpath

Let's say there are two files in sourcepath

    sourcepath/one.txt
    sourcepath/two.txt

This copies them to

    destpath/one.txt
    destpath/two.txt

Not to

    destpath/sourcepath/one.txt
    destpath/sourcepath/two.txt

If you are familiar with rsync, rclone always works as if you had
written a trailing / - meaning "copy the contents of this directory".
This applies to all commands and whether you are talking about the
source or destination.

See the --no-traverse option for controlling whether rclone lists the
destination directory or not. Supplying this option when copying a small
number of files into a large destination can speed transfers up greatly.

For example, if you have many files in /path/to/src but only a few of
them change every day, you can copy all the files which have changed
recently very efficiently like this:

    rclone copy --max-age 24h --no-traverse /path/to/src remote:

Note: Use the -P/--progress flag to view real-time transfer statistics.

Note: Use the --dry-run or the --interactive/-i flag to test without
copying anything.

    rclone copy source:path dest:path [flags]

Options

          --create-empty-src-dirs   Create empty source dirs on destination after copy
      -h, --help                    help for copy

See the global flags page for global options not listed here.

SEE ALSO

-   rclone - Show help for rclone commands, flags and backends.

rclone sync

Make source and dest identical, modifying destination only.

Synopsis

Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only.
Doesn't transfer files that are identical on source and destination,
testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM. Destination is updated
to match source, including deleting files if necessary (except duplicate
objects, see below).

Important: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the --dry-run
or the --interactive/-i flag.

    rclone sync -i SOURCE remote:DESTINATION

Note that files in the destination won't be deleted if there were any
errors at any point. Duplicate objects (files with the same name, on
those providers that support it) are also not yet handled.

It is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not the
directory so when source:path is a directory, it's the contents of
source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents. See
extended explanation in the copy command above if unsure.

If dest:path doesn't exist, it is created and the source:path contents
go there.

Note: Use the -P/--progress flag to view real-time transfer statistics

Note: Use the rclone dedupe command to deal with "Duplicate
object/directory found in source/destination - ignoring" errors. See
this forum post for more info.

    rclone sync source:path dest:path [flags]

Options

          --create-empty-src-dirs   Create empty source dirs on destination after sync
      -h, --help                    help for sync

See the global flags page for global options not listed here.

SEE ALSO

-   rclone - Show help for rclone commands, flags and backends.

rclone move

Move files from source to dest.

Synopsis

Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination directory.
Rclone will error if the source and destination overlap and the remote
does not support a server-side directory move operation.

If no filters are in use and if possible this will server-side move
source:path into dest:path. After this source:path will no longer exist.

Otherwise for each file in source:path selected by the filters (if any)
this will move it into dest:path. If possible a server-side move will be
used, otherwise it will copy it (server-side if possible) into dest:path
then delete the original (if no errors on copy) in source:path.

If you want to delete empty source directories after move, use the
--delete-empty-src-dirs flag.

See the --no-traverse option for controlling whether rclone lists the
destination directory or not. Supplying this option when moving a small
number of files into a large destination can speed transfers up greatly.

Important: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the --dry-run
or the --interactive/-i flag.

Note: Use the -P/--progress flag to view real-time transfer statistics.

    rclone move source:path dest:path [flags]

Options

          --create-empty-src-dirs   Create empty source dirs on destination after move
          --delete-empty-src-dirs   Delete empty source dirs after move
      -h, --help                    help for move

rclone delete

Remove the files in path.

Synopsis

Remove the files in path. Unlike purge it obeys include/exclude filters
so can be used to selectively delete files.

rclone delete only deletes files but leaves the directory structure
alone. If you want to delete a directory and all of its contents use the
purge command.

If you supply the --rmdirs flag, it will remove all empty directories
along with it. You can also use the separate command rmdir or rmdirs to
delete empty directories only.

For example, to delete all files bigger than 100 MiB, you may first want
to check what would be deleted (use either):

    rclone --min-size 100M lsl remote:path
    rclone --dry-run --min-size 100M delete remote:path

Then proceed with the actual delete:

    rclone --min-size 100M delete remote:path

That reads "delete everything with a minimum size of 100 MiB", hence
delete all files bigger than 100 MiB.

Important: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the --dry-run
or the --interactive/-i flag.

    rclone delete remote:path [flags]

Options

      -h, --help     help for delete
          --rmdirs   rmdirs removes empty directories but leaves root intact

rclone purge

Remove the path and all of its contents.

Synopsis

Remove the path and all of its contents. Note that this does not obey
include/exclude filters - everything will be removed. Use the delete
command if you want to selectively delete files. To delete empty
directories only, use command rmdir or rmdirs.

Important: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the --dry-run
or the --interactive/-i flag.

rclone rmdir

Remove the empty directory at path.

Synopsis

This removes empty directory given by path. Will not remove the path if
it has any objects in it, not even empty subdirectories. Use command
rmdirs (or delete with option --rmdirs) to do that.

To delete a path and any objects in it, use purge command.

    rclone rmdir remote:path [flags]

Options

      -h, --help   help for rmdir

rclone check

Checks the files in the source and destination match.

Synopsis

Checks the files in the source and destination match. It compares sizes
and hashes (MD5 or SHA1) and logs a report of files that don't match. It
doesn't alter the source or destination.

If you supply the --size-only flag, it will only compare the sizes not
the hashes as well. Use this for a quick check.

If you supply the --download flag, it will download the data from both
remotes and check them against each other on the fly. This can be useful
for remotes that don't support hashes or if you really want to check all
the data.

If you supply the --checkfile HASH flag with a valid hash name, the
source:path must point to a text file in the SUM format.

If you supply the --one-way flag, it will only check that files in the
source match the files in the destination, not the other way around.
This means that extra files in the destination that are not in the
source will not be detected.

The --differ, --missing-on-dst, --missing-on-src, --match and --error
flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or stdout if it is -)
supplied. What they write is described in the help below. For example
--differ will write all paths which are present on both the source and
destination but different.

The --combined flag will write a file (or stdout) which contains all
file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path to tell you
what happened to it. These are reminiscent of diff files.

-   = path means path was found in source and destination and was
    identical
-   `- path` means path was missing on the source, so only in the
    destination
-   `+ path` means path was missing on the destination, so only in the
    source
-   `* path` means path was present in source and destination but
    different.
-   ! path means there was an error reading or hashing the source or
    dest.

    rclone check source:path dest:path [flags]

Options

      -C, --checkfile string        Treat source:path as a SUM file with hashes of given type
          --combined string         Make a combined report of changes to this file
          --differ string           Report all non-matching files to this file
          --download                Check by downloading rather than with hash
          --error string            Report all files with errors (hashing or reading) to this file
      -h, --help                    help for check
          --match string            Report all matching files to this file
          --missing-on-dst string   Report all files missing from the destination to this file
          --missing-on-src string   Report all files missing from the source to this file
          --one-way                 Check one way only, source files must exist on remote

rclone ls

List the objects in the path with size and path.

Synopsis

Lists the objects in the source path to standard output in a human
readable format with size and path. Recurses by default.

Eg

    $ rclone ls swift:bucket
        60295 bevajer5jef
        90613 canole
        94467 diwogej7
        37600 fubuwic

Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.

There are several related list commands

-   ls to list size and path of objects only
-   lsl to list modification time, size and path of objects only
-   lsd to list directories only
-   lsf to list objects and directories in easy to parse format
-   lsjson to list objects and directories in JSON format

ls,lsl,lsd are designed to be human-readable. lsf is designed to be
human and machine-readable. lsjson is designed to be machine-readable.

Note that ls and lsl recurse by default - use --max-depth 1 to stop the
recursion.

The other list commands lsd,lsf,lsjson do not recurse by default - use
-R to make them recurse.

Listing a non-existent directory will produce an error except for
remotes which can't have empty directories (e.g. s3, swift, or gcs - the
bucket-based remotes).

    rclone ls remote:path [flags]

rclone lsd

List all directories/containers/buckets in the path.

Synopsis

Lists the directories in the source path to standard output. Does not
recurse by default. Use the -R flag to recurse.

This command lists the total size of the directory (if known, -1 if
not), the modification time (if known, the current time if not), the
number of objects in the directory (if known, -1 if not) and the name of
the directory, Eg

    $ rclone lsd swift:
          494000 2018-04-26 08:43:20     10000 10000files
              65 2018-04-26 08:43:20         1 1File

Or

    $ rclone lsd drive:test
              -1 2016-10-17 17:41:53        -1 1000files

rclone md5sum

Produces an md5sum file for all the objects in the path.

Synopsis

Produces an md5sum file for all the objects in the path. This is in the
same format as the standard md5sum tool produces.

By default, the hash is requested from the remote. If MD5 is not
supported by the remote, no hash will be returned. With the download
flag, the file will be downloaded from the remote and hashed locally
enabling MD5 for any remote.

This command can also hash data received on standard input (stdin), by
not passing a remote:path, or by passing a hyphen as remote:path when
there is data to read (if not, the hypen will be treated literaly, as a
relative path).

    rclone md5sum remote:path [flags]

Options

          --base64               Output base64 encoded hashsum
      -C, --checkfile string     Validate hashes against a given SUM file instead of printing them
          --download             Download the file and hash it locally; if this flag is not specified, the hash is requested from the remote
      -h, --help                 help for md5sum
          --output-file string   Output hashsums to a file rather than the terminal

rclone version

Show the version number.

Synopsis

Show the rclone version number, the go version, the build target OS and
architecture, the runtime OS and kernel version and bitness, build tags
and the type of executable (static or dynamic).

For example:

    $ rclone version
    rclone v1.55.0
    - os/version: ubuntu 18.04 (64 bit)
    - os/kernel: 4.15.0-136-generic (x86_64)
    - os/type: linux
    - os/arch: amd64
    - go/version: go1.16
    - go/linking: static
    - go/tags: none

Note: before rclone version 1.55 the os/type and os/arch lines were
merged, and the "go/version" line was tagged as "go version".

If you supply the --check flag, then it will do an online check to
compare your version with the latest release and the latest beta.

    $ rclone version --check
    yours:  1.42.0.6
    latest: 1.42          (released 2018-06-16)

rclone dedupe

Interactively find duplicate filenames and delete/rename them.

Synopsis

By default dedupe interactively finds files with duplicate names and
offers to delete all but one or rename them to be different. This is
known as deduping by name.

Deduping by name is only useful with a small group of backends (e.g.
Google Drive, Opendrive) that can have duplicate file names. It can be
run on wrapping backends (e.g. crypt) if they wrap a backend which
supports duplicate file names.

However if --by-hash is passed in then dedupe will find files with
duplicate hashes instead which will work on any backend which supports
at least one hash. This can be used to find files with duplicate
content. This is known as deduping by hash.

If deduping by name, first rclone will merge directories with the same
name. It will do this iteratively until all the identically named
directories have been merged.

Next, if deduping by name, for every group of duplicate file names /
hashes, it will delete all but one identical file it finds without
confirmation. This means that for most duplicated files the dedupe
command will not be interactive.

dedupe considers files to be identical if they have the same file path
and the same hash. If the backend does not support hashes (e.g. crypt
wrapping Google Drive) then they will never be found to be identical. If
you use the --size-only flag then files will be considered identical if
they have the same size (any hash will be ignored). This can be useful
on crypt backends which do not support hashes.

Next rclone will resolve the remaining duplicates. Exactly which action
is taken depends on the dedupe mode. By default, rclone will
interactively query the user for each one.

Important: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the --dry-run
or the --interactive/-i flag.

Here is an example run.

Before - with duplicates

Dedupe can be run non interactively using the --dedupe-mode flag or by
using an extra parameter with the same value

-   --dedupe-mode interactive - interactive as above.
-   --dedupe-mode skip - removes identical files then skips anything
    left.
-   --dedupe-mode first - removes identical files then keeps the first
    one.
-   --dedupe-mode newest - removes identical files then keeps the newest
    one.
-   --dedupe-mode oldest - removes identical files then keeps the oldest
    one.
-   --dedupe-mode largest - removes identical files then keeps the
    largest one.
-   --dedupe-mode smallest - removes identical files then keeps the
    smallest one.
-   --dedupe-mode rename - removes identical files then renames the rest
    to be different.
-   --dedupe-mode list - lists duplicate dirs and files only and changes
    nothing.

For example, to rename all the identically named photos in your Google
Photos directory, do

    rclone dedupe --dedupe-mode rename "drive:Google Photos"

Or

    rclone dedupe rename "drive:Google Photos"

Applying a --full flag to the command prints the bytes in full, e.g.

    Total:   18253611008
    Used:    7993453766
    Free:    1411001220
    Trashed: 104857602
    Other:   8849156022

A --json flag generates conveniently machine-readable output, e.g.

    {
        "total": 18253611008,
        "used": 7993453766,
        "trashed": 104857602,
        "other": 8849156022,
        "free": 1411001220
    }

Not all backends print all fields. Information is not included if it is
not provided by a backend. Where the value is unlimited it is omitted.

Some backends does not support the rclone about command at all, see
complete list in documentation.

rclone backend

Run a backend-specific command.

Synopsis

This runs a backend-specific command. The commands themselves (except
for "help" and "features") are defined by the backends and you should
see the backend docs for definitions.

You can discover what commands a backend implements by using

    rclone backend help remote:
    rclone backend help <backendname>

You can also discover information about the backend using (see
operations/fsinfo in the remote control docs for more info).

    rclone backend features remote:

Pass options to the backend command with -o. This should be key=value or
key, e.g.:

    rclone backend stats remote:path stats -o format=json -o long

Pass arguments to the backend by placing them on the end of the line

    rclone backend cleanup remote:path file1 file2 file3

Note to run these commands on a running backend then see backend/command
in the rc docs.

    rclone backend <command> remote:path [opts] <args> [flags]

Options

      -h, --help                 help for backend
          --json                 Always output in JSON format

rclone bisync

Perform bidirectonal synchronization between two paths.

Synopsis

Perform bidirectonal synchronization between two paths.

Bisync provides a bidirectional cloud sync solution in rclone. It
retains the Path1 and Path2 filesystem listings from the prior run. On
each successive run it will: - list files on Path1 and Path2, and check
for changes on each side. Changes include New, Newer, Older, and Deleted
files. - Propagate changes on Path1 to Path2, and vice-versa.

See full bisync description for details.

    rclone bisync remote1:path1 remote2:path2 [flags]

Options

          --check-access            Ensure expected RCLONE_TEST files are found on both Path1 and Path2 filesystems, else abort.
          --check-filename string   Filename for --check-access (default: RCLONE_TEST)
          --check-sync string       Controls comparison of final listings: true|false|only (default: true) (default "true")
          --filters-file string     Read filtering patterns from a file
          --force                   Bypass --max-delete safety check and run the sync. Consider using with --verbose
      -h, --help                    help for bisync
          --localtime               Use local time in listings (default: UTC)
          --no-cleanup              Retain working files (useful for troubleshooting and testing).
          --remove-empty-dirs       Remove empty directories at the final cleanup step.
      -1, --resync                  Performs the resync run. Path1 files may overwrite Path2 versions. Consider using --verbose or --dry-run first.
          --workdir string          Use custom working dir - useful for testing. (default: $HOME/.cache/rclone/bisync)

rclone cat

Concatenates any files and sends them to stdout.

Synopsis

rclone cat sends any files to standard output.

You can use it like this to output a single file

    rclone cat remote:path/to/file

Or like this to output any file in dir or its subdirectories.

    rclone cat remote:path/to/dir

Or like this to output any .txt files in dir or its subdirectories.

    rclone --include "*.txt" cat remote:path/to/dir

Use the --head flag to print characters only at the start, --tail for
the end and --offset and --count to print a section in the middle. Note
that if offset is negative it will count from the end, so
--offset -1 --count 1 is equivalent to --tail 1.

    rclone cat remote:path [flags]

Options

          --count int    Only print N characters (default -1)
          --discard      Discard the output instead of printing
          --head int     Only print the first N characters
      -h, --help         help for cat
          --offset int   Start printing at offset N (or from end if -ve)
          --tail int     Only print the last N characters

rclone checksum

Checks the files in the source against a SUM file.

Synopsis

Checks that hashsums of source files match the SUM file. It compares
hashes (MD5, SHA1, etc) and logs a report of files which don't match. It
doesn't alter the file system.

If you supply the --download flag, it will download the data from remote
and calculate the contents hash on the fly. This can be useful for
remotes that don't support hashes or if you really want to check all the
data.

Note that hash values in the SUM file are treated as case insensitive.

If you supply the --one-way flag, it will only check that files in the
source match the files in the destination, not the other way around.
This means that extra files in the destination that are not in the
source will not be detected.

The --differ, --missing-on-dst, --missing-on-src, --match and --error
flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or stdout if it is -)
supplied. What they write is described in the help below. For example
--differ will write all paths which are present on both the source and
destination but different.

The --combined flag will write a file (or stdout) which contains all
file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path to tell you
what happened to it. These are reminiscent of diff files.

-   = path means path was found in source and destination and was
    identical
-   `- path` means path was missing on the source, so only in the
    destination
-   `+ path` means path was missing on the destination, so only in the
    source
-   `* path` means path was present in source and destination but
    different.
-   ! path means there was an error reading or hashing the source or
    dest.

    rclone checksum <hash> sumfile src:path [flags]

Options

          --combined string         Make a combined report of changes to this file
          --differ string           Report all non-matching files to this file
          --download                Check by hashing the contents
          --error string            Report all files with errors (hashing or reading) to this file
      -h, --help                    help for checksum
          --match string            Report all matching files to this file
          --missing-on-dst string   Report all files missing from the destination to this file
          --missing-on-src string   Report all files missing from the source to this file
          --one-way                 Check one way only, source files must exist on remote

rclone config create

Create a new remote with name, type and options.

Synopsis

Create a new remote of name with type and options. The options should be
passed in pairs of key value or as key=value.

For example, to make a swift remote of name myremote using auto config
you would do:

    rclone config create myremote swift env_auth true
    rclone config create myremote swift env_auth=true

So for example if you wanted to configure a Google Drive remote but
using remote authorization you would do this:

    rclone config create mydrive drive config_is_local=false

Note that if the config process would normally ask a question the
default is taken (unless --non-interactive is used). Each time that
happens rclone will print or DEBUG a message saying how to affect the
value taken.

If any of the parameters passed is a password field, then rclone will
automatically obscure them if they aren't already obscured before
putting them in the config file.

NB If the password parameter is 22 characters or longer and consists
only of base64 characters then rclone can get confused about whether the
password is already obscured or not and put unobscured passwords into
the config file. If you want to be 100% certain that the passwords get
obscured then use the --obscure flag, or if you are 100% certain you are
already passing obscured passwords then use --no-obscure. You can also
set obscured passwords using the rclone config password command.

The flag --non-interactive is for use by applications that wish to
configure rclone themeselves, rather than using rclone's text based
configuration questions. If this flag is set, and rclone needs to ask
the user a question, a JSON blob will be returned with the question in
it.

This will look something like (some irrelevant detail removed):

    {
        "State": "*oauth-islocal,teamdrive,,",
        "Option": {
            "Name": "config_is_local",
            "Help": "Use auto config?\n * Say Y if not sure\n * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine\n",
            "Default": true,
            "Examples": [
                {
                    "Value": "true",
                    "Help": "Yes"
                },
                {
                    "Value": "false",
                    "Help": "No"
                }
            ],
            "Required": false,
            "IsPassword": false,
            "Type": "bool",
            "Exclusive": true,
        },
        "Error": "",
    }

The format of Option is the same as returned by rclone config providers.
The question should be asked to the user and returned to rclone as the
--result option along with the --state parameter.

The keys of Option are used as follows:

-   Name - name of variable - show to user
-   Help - help text. Hard wrapped at 80 chars. Any URLs should be
    clicky.
-   Default - default value - return this if the user just wants the
    default.
-   Examples - the user should be able to choose one of these
-   Required - the value should be non-empty
-   IsPassword - the value is a password and should be edited as such
-   Type - type of value, eg bool, string, int and others
-   Exclusive - if set no free-form entry allowed only the Examples
-   Irrelevant keys Provider, ShortOpt, Hide, NoPrefix, Advanced

If Error is set then it should be shown to the user at the same time as
the question.

    rclone config update name --continue --state "*oauth-islocal,teamdrive,," --result "true"

Note that when using --continue all passwords should be passed in the
clear (not obscured). Any default config values should be passed in with
each invocation of --continue.

At the end of the non interactive process, rclone will return a result
with State as empty string.

If --all is passed then rclone will ask all the config questions, not
just the post config questions. Any parameters are used as defaults for
questions as usual.

Note that bin/config.py in the rclone source implements this protocol as
a readable demonstration.

    rclone config create name type [key value]* [flags]

Options

          --all               Ask the full set of config questions

rclone config update

Update options in an existing remote.

Synopsis

Update an existing remote's options. The options should be passed in
pairs of key value or as key=value.

For example, to update the env_auth field of a remote of name myremote
you would do:

    rclone config update myremote env_auth true
    rclone config update myremote env_auth=true

If the remote uses OAuth the token will be updated, if you don't require
this add an extra parameter thus:

    rclone config update myremote env_auth=true config_refresh_token=false

Note that if the config process would normally ask a question the
default is taken (unless --non-interactive is used). Each time that
happens rclone will print or DEBUG a message saying how to affect the
value taken.

If any of the parameters passed is a password field, then rclone will
automatically obscure them if they aren't already obscured before
putting them in the config file.

NB If the password parameter is 22 characters or longer and consists
only of base64 characters then rclone can get confused about whether the
password is already obscured or not and put unobscured passwords into
the config file. If you want to be 100% certain that the passwords get
obscured then use the --obscure flag, or if you are 100% certain you are
already passing obscured passwords then use --no-obscure. You can also
set obscured passwords using the rclone config password command.

The flag --non-interactive is for use by applications that wish to

rclone copyto

Copy files from source to dest, skipping identical files.

Synopsis

If source:path is a file or directory then it copies it to a file or
directory named dest:path.

This can be used to upload single files to other than their current
name. If the source is a directory then it acts exactly like the copy
command.

So

    rclone copyto src dst

where src and dst are rclone paths, either remote:path or /path/to/local
or C:.

This will:

    if src is file
        copy it to dst, overwriting an existing file if it exists
    if src is directory
        copy it to dst, overwriting existing files if they exist
        see copy command for full details

This doesn't transfer files that are identical on src and dst, testing
by size and modification time or MD5SUM. It doesn't delete files from
the destination.

Note: Use the -P/--progress flag to view real-time transfer statistics

    rclone copyto source:path dest:path [flags]

Options

      -h, --help   help for copyto

rclone copyurl

Copy url content to dest.

Synopsis

Download a URL's content and copy it to the destination without saving
it in temporary storage.

Setting --auto-filename will cause the file name to be retrieved from
the URL (after any redirections) and used in the destination path. With
--print-filename in addition, the resulting file name will be printed.

Setting --no-clobber will prevent overwriting file on the destination if
there is one with the same name.

Setting --stdout or making the output file name - will cause the output
to be written to standard output.

    rclone copyurl https://example.com dest:path [flags]

Options

      -a, --auto-filename    Get the file name from the URL and use it for destination file path
      -h, --help             help for copyurl
          --no-clobber       Prevent overwriting file with same name
      -p, --print-filename   Print the resulting name from --auto-filename
          --stdout           Write the output to stdout rather than a file

rclone cryptcheck

Cryptcheck checks the integrity of a crypted remote.

Synopsis

rclone cryptcheck checks a remote against a crypted remote. This is the
equivalent of running rclone check, but able to check the checksums of
the crypted remote.

For it to work the underlying remote of the cryptedremote must support
some kind of checksum.

It works by reading the nonce from each file on the cryptedremote: and
using that to encrypt each file on the remote:. It then checks the
checksum of the underlying file on the cryptedremote: against the
checksum of the file it has just encrypted.

Use it like this

    rclone cryptcheck /path/to/files encryptedremote:path

You can use it like this also, but that will involve downloading all the
files in remote:path.

    rclone cryptcheck remote:path encryptedremote:path

After it has run it will log the status of the encryptedremote:.

If you supply the --one-way flag, it will only check that files in the
source match the files in the destination, not the other way around.
This means that extra files in the destination that are not in the
source will not be detected.

The --differ, --missing-on-dst, --missing-on-src, --match and --error
flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or stdout if it is -)
supplied. What they write is described in the help below. For example
--differ will write all paths which are present on both the source and
destination but different.

The --combined flag will write a file (or stdout) which contains all
file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path to tell you
what happened to it. These are reminiscent of diff files.

-   = path means path was found in source and destination and was
    identical
-   `- path` means path was missing on the source, so only in the
    destination
-   `+ path` means path was missing on the destination, so only in the
    source
-   `* path` means path was present in source and destination but
    different.
-   ! path means there was an error reading or hashing the source or
    dest.

    rclone cryptcheck remote:path cryptedremote:path [flags]

Options

          --combined string         Make a combined report of changes to this file
          --differ string           Report all non-matching files to this file
          --error string            Report all files with errors (hashing or reading) to this file
      -h, --help                    help for cryptcheck
          --match string            Report all matching files to this file
          --missing-on-dst string   Report all files missing from the destination to this file
          --missing-on-src string   Report all files missing from the source to this file
          --one-way                 Check one way only, source files must exist on remote

rclone cryptdecode

Cryptdecode returns unencrypted file names.

Synopsis

rclone cryptdecode returns unencrypted file names when provided with a
list of encrypted file names. List limit is 10 items.

If you supply the --reverse flag, it will return encrypted file names.

use it like this

    rclone cryptdecode encryptedremote: encryptedfilename1 encryptedfilename2

    rclone cryptdecode --reverse encryptedremote: filename1 filename2

Another way to accomplish this is by using the rclone backend encode (or
decode)command. See the documentation on the crypt overlay for more
info.

rclone hashsum

Produces a hashsum file for all the objects in the path.

Synopsis

Produces a hash file for all the objects in the path using the hash
named. The output is in the same format as the standard md5sum/sha1sum
tool.

By default, the hash is requested from the remote. If the hash is not
supported by the remote, no hash will be returned. With the download
flag, the file will be downloaded from the remote and hashed locally
enabling any hash for any remote.

This command can also hash data received on standard input (stdin), by
not passing a remote:path, or by passing a hyphen as remote:path when
there is data to read (if not, the hypen will be treated literaly, as a
relative path).

Run without a hash to see the list of all supported hashes, e.g.

    $ rclone hashsum
    Supported hashes are:
      * md5
      * sha1
      * whirlpool
      * crc32
      * sha256
      * dropbox
      * mailru
      * quickxor

    $ rclone hashsum MD5 remote:path

Note that hash names are case insensitive and values are output in lower
case.

    rclone hashsum <hash> remote:path [flags]

          --base64               Output base64 encoded hashsum
      -C, --checkfile string     Validate hashes against a given SUM file instead of printing them
          --download             Download the file and hash it locally; if this flag is not specified, the hash is requested from the remote
      -h, --help                 help for hashsum
          --output-file string   Output hashsums to a file rather than the terminal

rclone link

Generate public link to file/folder.

Synopsis

rclone link will create, retrieve or remove a public link to the given
file or folder.

    rclone link remote:path/to/file
    rclone link remote:path/to/folder/
    rclone link --unlink remote:path/to/folder/
    rclone link --expire 1d remote:path/to/file

If you supply the --expire flag, it will set the expiration time
otherwise it will use the default (100 years). Note not all backends
support the --expire flag - if the backend doesn't support it then the
link returned won't expire.

Use the --unlink flag to remove existing public links to the file or
folder. Note not all backends support "--unlink" flag - those that don't
will just ignore it.

If successful, the last line of the output will contain the link. Exact
capabilities depend on the remote, but the link will always by default
be created with the least constraints – e.g. no expiry, no password
protection, accessible without account.

    rclone link remote:path [flags]

Options

          --expire Duration   The amount of time that the link will be valid (default off)
      -h, --help              help for link
          --unlink            Remove existing public link to file/folder

rclone lsf

List directories and objects in remote:path formatted for parsing.

Synopsis

List the contents of the source path (directories and objects) to
standard output in a form which is easy to parse by scripts. By default
this will just be the names of the objects and directories, one per
line. The directories will have a / suffix.

Eg

    $ rclone lsf swift:bucket
    bevajer5jef
    canole
    diwogej7
    ferejej3gux/
    fubuwic

Use the --format option to control what gets listed. By default this is
just the path, but you can use these parameters to control the output:

    p - path
    s - size
    t - modification time
    h - hash
    i - ID of object
    o - Original ID of underlying object
    m - MimeType of object if known
    e - encrypted name
    T - tier of storage if known, e.g. "Hot" or "Cool"

So if you wanted the path, size and modification time, you would use
--format "pst", or maybe --format "tsp" to put the path last.

Eg

    $ rclone lsf  --format "tsp" swift:bucket
    2016-06-25 18:55:41;60295;bevajer5jef
    2016-06-25 18:55:43;90613;canole
    2016-06-25 18:55:43;94467;diwogej7
    2018-04-26 08:50:45;0;ferejej3gux/
    2016-06-25 18:55:40;37600;fubuwic

If you specify "h" in the format you will get the MD5 hash by default,
use the "--hash" flag to change which hash you want. Note that this can
be returned as an empty string if it isn't available on the object (and
for directories), "ERROR" if there was an error reading it from the
object and "UNSUPPORTED" if that object does not support that hash type.

For example, to emulate the md5sum command you can use

    rclone lsf -R --hash MD5 --format hp --separator "  " --files-only .

Eg

    $ rclone lsf -R --hash MD5 --format hp --separator "  " --files-only swift:bucket
    7908e352297f0f530b84a756f188baa3  bevajer5jef
    cd65ac234e6fea5925974a51cdd865cc  canole
    03b5341b4f234b9d984d03ad076bae91  diwogej7
    8fd37c3810dd660778137ac3a66cc06d  fubuwic
    99713e14a4c4ff553acaf1930fad985b  gixacuh7ku

(Though "rclone md5sum ." is an easier way of typing this.)

By default the separator is ";" this can be changed with the --separator
flag. Note that separators aren't escaped in the path so putting it last
is a good strategy.

Eg

    $ rclone lsf  --separator "," --format "tshp" swift:bucket
    2016-06-25 18:55:41,60295,7908e352297f0f530b84a756f188baa3,bevajer5jef

    2016-06-25 18:55:40,37600,8fd37c3810dd660778137ac3a66cc06d,fubuwic

You can output in CSV standard format. This will escape things in " if
they contain ,

Eg

    $ rclone lsf --csv --files-only --format ps remote:path
    test.log,22355
    test.sh,449
    "this file contains a comma, in the file name.txt",6

Note that the --absolute parameter is useful for making lists of files
to pass to an rclone copy with the --files-from-raw flag.

For example, to find all the files modified within one day and copy
those only (without traversing the whole directory structure):

    rclone lsf --absolute --files-only --max-age 1d /path/to/local > new_files
    rclone copy --files-from-raw new_files /path/to/local remote:path

Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.

There are several related list commands

-   ls to list size and path of objects only
-   lsl to list modification time, size and path of objects only
-   lsd to list directories only
-   lsf to list objects and directories in easy to parse format
-   lsjson to list objects and directories in JSON format

ls,lsl,lsd are designed to be human-readable. lsf is designed to be
human and machine-readable. lsjson is designed to be machine-readable.

Note that ls and lsl recurse by default - use --max-depth 1 to stop the
recursion.

The other list commands lsd,lsf,lsjson do not recurse by default - use
-R to make them recurse.

Listing a non-existent directory will produce an error except for
remotes which can't have empty directories (e.g. s3, swift, or gcs - the
bucket-based remotes).

    rclone lsf remote:path [flags]

Options

          --absolute           Put a leading / in front of path names
          --csv                Output in CSV format
      -d, --dir-slash          Append a slash to directory names (default true)
          --dirs-only          Only list directories
          --files-only         Only list files
      -F, --format string      Output format - see  help for details (default "p")
          --hash h             Use this hash when h is used in the format MD5|SHA-1|DropboxHash (default "md5")
      -h, --help               help for lsf
      -R, --recursive          Recurse into the listing
      -s, --separator string   Separator for the items in the format (default ";")

rclone lsjson

List directories and objects in the path in JSON format.

Synopsis

List directories and objects in the path in JSON format.

The output is an array of Items, where each Item looks like this

{ "Hashes" : { "SHA-1" : "f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f",
"MD5" : "b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184", "DropboxHash" :
"ecb65bb98f9d905b70458986c39fcbad7715e5f2fcc3b1f07767d7c83e2438cc" },
"ID": "y2djkhiujf83u33", "OrigID": "UYOJVTUW00Q1RzTDA", "IsBucket" :
false, "IsDir" : false, "MimeType" : "application/octet-stream",
"ModTime" : "2017-05-31T16:15:57.034468261+01:00", "Name" : "file.txt",
"Encrypted" : "v0qpsdq8anpci8n929v3uu9338", "EncryptedPath" :
"kja9098349023498/v0qpsdq8anpci8n929v3uu9338", "Path" :
"full/path/goes/here/file.txt", "Size" : 6, "Tier" : "hot", }

If --hash is not specified the Hashes property won't be emitted. The
types of hash can be specified with the --hash-type parameter (which may
be repeated). If --hash-type is set then it implies --hash.

If --no-modtime is specified then ModTime will be blank. This can speed
things up on remotes where reading the ModTime takes an extra request
(e.g. s3, swift).

If --no-mimetype is specified then MimeType will be blank. This can
speed things up on remotes where reading the MimeType takes an extra
request (e.g. s3, swift).

If --encrypted is not specified the Encrypted won't be emitted.

If --dirs-only is not specified files in addition to directories are
returned

If --files-only is not specified directories in addition to the files
will be returned.

if --stat is set then a single JSON blob will be returned about the item
pointed to. This will return an error if the item isn't found. However
on bucket based backends (like s3, gcs, b2, azureblob etc) if the item
isn't found it will return an empty directory as it isn't possible to
tell empty directories from missing directories there.

The Path field will only show folders below the remote path being
listed. If "remote:path" contains the file "subfolder/file.txt", the
Path for "file.txt" will be "subfolder/file.txt", not
"remote:path/subfolder/file.txt". When used without --recursive the Path
will always be the same as Name.

If the directory is a bucket in a bucket-based backend, then "IsBucket"
will be set to true. This key won't be present unless it is "true".

The time is in RFC3339 format with up to nanosecond precision. The
number of decimal digits in the seconds will depend on the precision
that the remote can hold the times, so if times are accurate to the
nearest millisecond (e.g. Google Drive) then 3 digits will always be
shown ("2017-05-31T16:15:57.034+01:00") whereas if the times are
accurate to the nearest second (Dropbox, Box, WebDav, etc.) no digits
will be shown ("2017-05-31T16:15:57+01:00").

The whole output can be processed as a JSON blob, or alternatively it
can be processed line by line as each item is written one to a line.

Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.

There are several related list commands

-   ls to list size and path of objects only
-   lsl to list modification time, size and path of objects only
-   lsd to list directories only
-   lsf to list objects and directories in easy to parse format
-   lsjson to list objects and directories in JSON format

ls,lsl,lsd are designed to be human-readable. lsf is designed to be

rclone mount

Mount the remote as file system on a mountpoint.

Synopsis

rclone mount allows Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows to mount any of
Rclone's cloud storage systems as a file system with FUSE.

First set up your remote using rclone config. Check it works with
rclone ls etc.

On Linux and macOS, you can run mount in either foreground or background
(aka daemon) mode. Mount runs in foreground mode by default. Use the
--daemon flag to force background mode. On Windows you can run mount in
foreground only, the flag is ignored.

In background mode rclone acts as a generic Unix mount program: the main
program starts, spawns background rclone process to setup and maintain
the mount, waits until success or timeout and exits with appropriate
code (killing the child process if it fails).

On Linux/macOS/FreeBSD start the mount like this, where
/path/to/local/mount is an empty existing directory:

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files /path/to/local/mount

On Windows you can start a mount in different ways. See below for
details. If foreground mount is used interactively from a console
window, rclone will serve the mount and occupy the console so another
window should be used to work with the mount until rclone is interrupted
e.g. by pressing Ctrl-C.

The following examples will mount to an automatically assigned drive, to
specific drive letter X:, to path C:\path\parent\mount (where parent
directory or drive must exist, and mount must not exist, and is not
supported when mounting as a network drive), and the last example will
mount as network share \\cloud\remote and map it to an automatically
assigned drive:

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files *
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files C:\path\parent\mount
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files \\cloud\remote

When the program ends while in foreground mode, either via Ctrl+C or
receiving a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, the mount should be automatically
stopped.

When running in background mode the user will have to stop the mount
manually:

    # Linux
    fusermount -u /path/to/local/mount
    # OS X
    umount /path/to/local/mount

The umount operation can fail, for example when the mountpoint is busy.
When that happens, it is the user's responsibility to stop the mount
manually.

The size of the mounted file system will be set according to information
retrieved from the remote, the same as returned by the rclone about
command. Remotes with unlimited storage may report the used size only,
then an additional 1 PiB of free space is assumed. If the remote does
not support the about feature at all, then 1 PiB is set as both the
total and the free size.

Installing on Windows

To run rclone mount on Windows, you will need to download and install
WinFsp.

WinFsp is an open-source Windows File System Proxy which makes it easy
to write user space file systems for Windows. It provides a FUSE
emulation layer which rclone uses combination with cgofuse. Both of
these packages are by Bill Zissimopoulos who was very helpful during the
implementation of rclone mount for Windows.

Mounting modes on windows

Unlike other operating systems, Microsoft Windows provides a different
filesystem type for network and fixed drives. It optimises access on the
assumption fixed disk drives are fast and reliable, while network drives
have relatively high latency and less reliability. Some settings can
also be differentiated between the two types, for example that Windows
Explorer should just display icons and not create preview thumbnails for
image and video files on network drives.

In most cases, rclone will mount the remote as a normal, fixed disk
drive by default. However, you can also choose to mount it as a remote
network drive, often described as a network share. If you mount an
rclone remote using the default, fixed drive mode and experience
unexpected program errors, freezes or other issues, consider mounting as
a network drive instead.

When mounting as a fixed disk drive you can either mount to an unused
drive letter, or to a path representing a non-existent subdirectory of
an existing parent directory or drive. Using the special value * will
tell rclone to automatically assign the next available drive letter,
starting with Z: and moving backward. Examples:

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files *
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files C:\path\parent\mount
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:

Option --volname can be used to set a custom volume name for the mounted
file system. The default is to use the remote name and path.

To mount as network drive, you can add option --network-mode to your
mount command. Mounting to a directory path is not supported in this
mode, it is a limitation Windows imposes on junctions, so the remote
must always be mounted to a drive letter.

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X: --network-mode

A volume name specified with --volname will be used to create the
network share path. A complete UNC path, such as \\cloud\remote,
optionally with path \\cloud\remote\madeup\path, will be used as is. Any
other string will be used as the share part, after a default prefix
\\server\. If no volume name is specified then \\server\share will be
used. You must make sure the volume name is unique when you are mounting
more than one drive, or else the mount command will fail. The share name
will treated as the volume label for the mapped drive, shown in Windows
Explorer etc, while the complete \\server\share will be reported as the
remote UNC path by net use etc, just like a normal network drive
mapping.

If you specify a full network share UNC path with --volname, this will
implicitely set the --network-mode option, so the following two examples
have same result:

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X: --network-mode
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X: --volname \\server\share

You may also specify the network share UNC path as the mountpoint
itself. Then rclone will automatically assign a drive letter, same as
with * and use that as mountpoint, and instead use the UNC path
specified as the volume name, as if it were specified with the --volname
option. This will also implicitely set the --network-mode option. This
means the following two examples have same result:

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files \\cloud\remote
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files * --volname \\cloud\remote

There is yet another way to enable network mode, and to set the share
path, and that is to pass the "native" libfuse/WinFsp option directly:
--fuse-flag --VolumePrefix=\server\share. Note that the path must be
with just a single backslash prefix in this case.

Note: In previous versions of rclone this was the only supported method.

Windows filesystem permissions

The FUSE emulation layer on Windows must convert between the POSIX-based
permission model used in FUSE, and the permission model used in Windows,
based on access-control lists (ACL).

The mounted filesystem will normally get three entries in its
access-control list (ACL), representing permissions for the POSIX
permission scopes: Owner, group and others. By default, the owner and
group will be taken from the current user, and the built-in group
"Everyone" will be used to represent others. The user/group can be
customized with FUSE options "UserName" and "GroupName", e.g.
-o UserName=user123 -o GroupName="Authenticated Users". The permissions
on each entry will be set according to options --dir-perms and
--file-perms, which takes a value in traditional numeric notation.

The default permissions corresponds to
--file-perms 0666 --dir-perms 0777, i.e. read and write permissions to
everyone. This means you will not be able to start any programs from the
the mount. To be able to do that you must add execute permissions, e.g.
--file-perms 0777 --dir-perms 0777 to add it to everyone. If the program
needs to write files, chances are you will have to enable VFS File
Caching as well (see also limitations).

Note that the mapping of permissions is not always trivial, and the
result you see in Windows Explorer may not be exactly like you expected.
For example, when setting a value that includes write access, this will
be mapped to individual permissions "write attributes", "write data" and
"append data", but not "write extended attributes". Windows will then
show this as basic permission "Special" instead of "Write", because
"Write" includes the "write extended attributes" permission.

If you set POSIX permissions for only allowing access to the owner,
using --file-perms 0600 --dir-perms 0700, the user group and the
built-in "Everyone" group will still be given some special permissions,
such as "read attributes" and "read permissions", in Windows. This is
done for compatibility reasons, e.g. to allow users without additional
permissions to be able to read basic metadata about files like in UNIX.
One case that may arise is that other programs (incorrectly) interprets
this as the file being accessible by everyone. For example an SSH client
may warn about "unprotected private key file".

WinFsp 2021 (version 1.9) introduces a new FUSE option "FileSecurity",
that allows the complete specification of file security descriptors
using SDDL. With this you can work around issues such as the mentioned
"unprotected private key file" by specifying
-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FA;;;OW)", for file all access (FA) to the owner
(OW).

Windows caveats

Drives created as Administrator are not visible to other accounts, not
even an account that was elevated to Administrator with the User Account
Control (UAC) feature. A result of this is that if you mount to a drive
letter from a Command Prompt run as Administrator, and then try to
access the same drive from Windows Explorer (which does not run as
Administrator), you will not be able to see the mounted drive.

If you don't need to access the drive from applications running with
administrative privileges, the easiest way around this is to always
create the mount from a non-elevated command prompt.

To make mapped drives available to the user account that created them
regardless if elevated or not, there is a special Windows setting called
linked connections that can be enabled.

It is also possible to make a drive mount available to everyone on the
system, by running the process creating it as the built-in SYSTEM
account. There are several ways to do this: One is to use the
command-line utility PsExec, from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite, which
has option -s to start processes as the SYSTEM account. Another
alternative is to run the mount command from a Windows Scheduled Task,
or a Windows Service, configured to run as the SYSTEM account. A third
alternative is to use the WinFsp.Launcher infrastructure). Note that
when running rclone as another user, it will not use the configuration
file from your profile unless you tell it to with the --config option.
Read more in the install documentation.

Note that mapping to a directory path, instead of a drive letter, does
not suffer from the same limitations.

Limitations

Without the use of --vfs-cache-mode this can only write files
sequentially, it can only seek when reading. This means that many
applications won't work with their files on an rclone mount without
--vfs-cache-mode writes or --vfs-cache-mode full. See the VFS File
Caching section for more info.

The bucket-based remotes (e.g. Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2,
Hubic) do not support the concept of empty directories, so empty
directories will have a tendency to disappear once they fall out of the
directory cache.

When rclone mount is invoked on Unix with --daemon flag, the main rclone
program will wait for the background mount to become ready or until the
timeout specified by the --daemon-wait flag. On Linux it can check mount
status using ProcFS so the flag in fact sets maximum time to wait, while
the real wait can be less. On macOS / BSD the time to wait is constant
and the check is performed only at the end. We advise you to set wait
time on macOS reasonably.

Only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OS X and Windows at the moment.

rclone mount vs rclone sync/copy

File systems expect things to be 100% reliable, whereas cloud storage
systems are a long way from 100% reliable. The rclone sync/copy commands
cope with this with lots of retries. However rclone mount can't use
retries in the same way without making local copies of the uploads. Look
at the VFS File Caching for solutions to make mount more reliable.

Attribute caching

You can use the flag --attr-timeout to set the time the kernel caches
the attributes (size, modification time, etc.) for directory entries.

The default is 1s which caches files just long enough to avoid too many
callbacks to rclone from the kernel.

In theory 0s should be the correct value for filesystems which can
change outside the control of the kernel. However this causes quite a
few problems such as rclone using too much memory, rclone not serving
files to samba and excessive time listing directories.

The kernel can cache the info about a file for the time given by
--attr-timeout. You may see corruption if the remote file changes length
during this window. It will show up as either a truncated file or a file
with garbage on the end. With --attr-timeout 1s this is very unlikely
but not impossible. The higher you set --attr-timeout the more likely it
is. The default setting of "1s" is the lowest setting which mitigates
the problems above.

If you set it higher (10s or 1m say) then the kernel will call back to
rclone less often making it more efficient, however there is more chance
of the corruption issue above.

If files don't change on the remote outside of the control of rclone
then there is no chance of corruption.

This is the same as setting the attr_timeout option in mount.fuse.

Filters

Note that all the rclone filters can be used to select a subset of the
files to be visible in the mount.

systemd

When running rclone mount as a systemd service, it is possible to use
Type=notify. In this case the service will enter the started state after
the mountpoint has been successfully set up. Units having the rclone
mount service specified as a requirement will see all files and folders
immediately in this mode.

Note that systemd runs mount units without any environment variables
including PATH or HOME. This means that tilde (~) expansion will not
work and you should provide --config and --cache-dir explicitly as
absolute paths via rclone arguments. Since mounting requires the
fusermount program, rclone will use the fallback PATH of /bin:/usr/bin
in this scenario. Please ensure that fusermount is present on this PATH.

Rclone as Unix mount helper

The core Unix program /bin/mount normally takes the -t FSTYPE argument
then runs the /sbin/mount.FSTYPE helper program passing it mount options
as -o key=val,... or --opt=.... Automount (classic or systemd) behaves
in a similar way.

rclone by default expects GNU-style flags --key val. To run it as a
mount helper you should symlink rclone binary to /sbin/mount.rclone and
optionally /usr/bin/rclonefs, e.g.
ln -s /usr/bin/rclone /sbin/mount.rclone. rclone will detect it and
translate command-line arguments appropriately.

Now you can run classic mounts like this:

    mount sftp1:subdir /mnt/data -t rclone -o vfs_cache_mode=writes,sftp_key_file=/path/to/pem

or create systemd mount units:

    # /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.mount
    [Unit]
    After=network-online.target
    [Mount]
    Type=rclone
    What=sftp1:subdir
    Where=/mnt/data
    Options=rw,allow_other,args2env,vfs-cache-mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache-dir=/var/rclone

optionally accompanied by systemd automount unit

    # /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.automount
    [Unit]
    After=network-online.target
    Before=remote-fs.target
    [Automount]
    Where=/mnt/data
    TimeoutIdleSec=600
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

or add in /etc/fstab a line like

    sftp1:subdir /mnt/data rclone rw,noauto,nofail,_netdev,x-systemd.automount,args2env,vfs_cache_mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache_dir=/var/cache/rclone 0 0

or use classic Automountd. Remember to provide explicit
config=...,cache-dir=... as a workaround for mount units being run
without HOME.

Rclone in the mount helper mode will split -o argument(s) by comma,
replace _ by - and prepend -- to get the command-line flags. Options
containing commas or spaces can be wrapped in single or double quotes.
Any inner quotes inside outer quotes of the same type should be doubled.

Mount option syntax includes a few extra options treated specially:

-   env.NAME=VALUE will set an environment variable for the mount
    process. This helps with Automountd and Systemd.mount which don't
    allow setting custom environment for mount helpers. Typically you
    will use env.HTTPS_PROXY=proxy.host:3128 or env.HOME=/root
-   command=cmount can be used to run cmount or any other rclone command
    rather than the default mount.
-   args2env will pass mount options to the mount helper running in
    background via environment variables instead of command line
    arguments. This allows to hide secrets from such commands as ps or
    pgrep.
-   vv... will be transformed into appropriate --verbose=N
-   standard mount options like x-systemd.automount, _netdev, nosuid and
    alike are intended only for Automountd and ignored by rclone.

VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing
system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS
layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing
this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

VFS Directory Cache

Using the --dir-cache-time flag, you can control how long a directory
should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend.
Changes made through the mount will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface
or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up
within the polling interval.

You can send a SIGHUP signal to rclone for it to flush all directory
caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone
instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

VFS File Buffering

The --buffer-size flag determines the amount of memory, that will be
used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer
will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
--buffer-size * open files.

VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with -vv rclone will print the location of the file cache. The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with --cache-dir or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by --vfs-cache-mode. The higher
the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using
disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
and if they haven't been accessed for --vfs-write-back seconds. If
rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will
be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.

If using --vfs-cache-max-size note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every
--vfs-cache-poll-interval. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted
from the cache.

You should not run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with
the same or overlapping remotes if using --vfs-cache-mode > off. This
can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around
this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with --cache-dir. You
don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.

--vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote
and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

-   Files can't be opened for both read AND write
-   Files opened for write can't be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
-   Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
-   Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
-   If an upload fails it can't be retried

--vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write
will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

-   Files opened for write only can't be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
-   If an upload fails it can't be retried

--vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

--vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will
keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to --vfs-cache-mode writes.

When reading a file rclone will read --buffer-size plus --vfs-read-ahead
bytes ahead. The --buffer-size is buffered in memory whereas the
--vfs-read-ahead is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that --buffer-size is not set too
large and --vfs-read-ahead is set large if required.

IMPORTANT not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory
is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an
ERROR message if one is detected.

VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk
specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by
requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the
cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size --vfs-read-chunk-size, and
then double the size for each read. When --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit is
specified, and greater than --vfs-read-chunk-size, the chunk size for
each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is
reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is
disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.

With --vfs-read-chunk-size 100M and --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0 the
following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M,
300M-400M and so on. When --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M is specified,
the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M,
1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting --vfs-read-chunk-size to 0 or "off" disables chunked reading.

VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the chunked reading feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the --no-modtime flag (or
use --use-server-modtime for a slightly different effect) as each read
of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Mount read-only.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than
seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write
to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk
cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (--vfs-cache-mode with value writes or
full), the global flag --transfers can be set to adjust the number of
parallel uploads of modified files from cache (the related global flag
--checkers have no effect on mount).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case
used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to
query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ
only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to
make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The --vfs-case-insensitive mount flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the
mounted file system as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a
value on command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system. If an argument
refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of
the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with
exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case
exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens
only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names
created anew by rclone is controlled by an underlying mounted file
system.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by
rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to
satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and
macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then
it is "true".

Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running df on the
filesystem, then pass the flag --vfs-used-is-size to rclone. With this
flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information,
rclone will scan the whole remote similar to rclone size and compute the
total used space itself.

WARNING. Contrary to rclone size, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots
of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and
only with caching.

rclone moveto

Move file or directory from source to dest.

Synopsis

If source:path is a file or directory then it moves it to a file or
directory named dest:path.

This can be used to rename files or upload single files to other than
their existing name. If the source is a directory then it acts exactly
like the move command.

So

    rclone moveto src dst

where src and dst are rclone paths, either remote:path or /path/to/local
or C:.

This will:

    if src is file
        move it to dst, overwriting an existing file if it exists
    if src is directory
        move it to dst, overwriting existing files if they exist
        see move command for full details

This doesn't transfer files that are identical on src and dst, testing
by size and modification time or MD5SUM. src will be deleted on
successful transfer.

Important: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the --dry-run
or the --interactive/-i flag.

Note: Use the -P/--progress flag to view real-time transfer statistics.

rclone ncdu

Explore a remote with a text based user interface.

Synopsis

This displays a text based user interface allowing the navigation of a
remote. It is most useful for answering the question - "What is using
all my disk space?".

To make the user interface it first scans the entire remote given and
builds an in memory representation. rclone ncdu can be used during this
scanning phase and you will see it building up the directory structure
as it goes along.

Here are the keys - press '?' to toggle the help on and off

     ↑,↓ or k,j to Move
     →,l to enter
     ←,h to return
     c toggle counts
     g toggle graph
     a toggle average size in directory
     u toggle human-readable format
     n,s,C,A sort by name,size,count,average size
     d delete file/directory
     y copy current path to clipboard
     Y display current path
     ^L refresh screen
     ? to toggle help on and off
     q/ESC/c-C to quit

This an homage to the ncdu tool but for rclone remotes. It is missing
lots of features at the moment but is useful as it stands.

Note that it might take some time to delete big files/folders. The UI
won't respond in the meantime since the deletion is done synchronously.

rclone obscure

Obscure password for use in the rclone config file.

Synopsis

In the rclone config file, human-readable passwords are obscured.
Obscuring them is done by encrypting them and writing them out in
base64. This is not a secure way of encrypting these passwords as rclone
can decrypt them - it is to prevent "eyedropping" - namely someone
seeing a password in the rclone config file by accident.

Many equally important things (like access tokens) are not obscured in
the config file. However it is very hard to shoulder surf a 64 character
hex token.

This command can also accept a password through STDIN instead of an
argument by passing a hyphen as an argument. This will use the first
line of STDIN as the password not including the trailing newline.

echo "secretpassword" | rclone obscure -

If there is no data on STDIN to read, rclone obscure will default to
obfuscating the hyphen itself.

If you want to encrypt the config file then please use config file
encryption - see rclone config for more info.

rclone rc

Run a command against a running rclone.

Synopsis

This runs a command against a running rclone. Use the --url flag to
specify an non default URL to connect on. This can be either a ":port"
which is taken to mean "http://localhost:port" or a "host:port" which is
taken to mean "http://host:port"

A username and password can be passed in with --user and --pass.

Note that --rc-addr, --rc-user, --rc-pass will be read also for --url,
--user, --pass.

Arguments should be passed in as parameter=value.

The result will be returned as a JSON object by default.

The --json parameter can be used to pass in a JSON blob as an input
instead of key=value arguments. This is the only way of passing in more
complicated values.

The -o/--opt option can be used to set a key "opt" with key, value
options in the form "-o key=value" or "-o key". It can be repeated as
many times as required. This is useful for rc commands which take the
"opt" parameter which by convention is a dictionary of strings.

    -o key=value -o key2

Will place this in the "opt" value

    {"key":"value", "key2","")

The -a/--arg option can be used to set strings in the "arg" value. It
can be repeated as many times as required. This is useful for rc
commands which take the "arg" parameter which by convention is a list of
strings.

    -a value -a value2

Will place this in the "arg" value

    ["value", "value2"]

Use --loopback to connect to the rclone instance running "rclone rc".
This is very useful for testing commands without having to run an rclone
rc server, e.g.:

    rclone rc --loopback operations/about fs=/

Use "rclone rc" to see a list of all possible commands.

    rclone rc commands parameter [flags]

Options

      -a, --arg stringArray   Argument placed in the "arg" array
      -h, --help              help for rc
          --json string       Input JSON - use instead of key=value args
          --loopback          If set connect to this rclone instance not via HTTP
          --no-output         If set, don't output the JSON result
      -o, --opt stringArray   Option in the form name=value or name placed in the "opt" array
          --pass string       Password to use to connect to rclone remote control
          --url string        URL to connect to rclone remote control (default "http://localhost:5572/")
          --user string       Username to use to rclone remote control

rclone rcat

Copies standard input to file on remote.

Synopsis

rclone rcat reads from standard input (stdin) and copies it to a single
remote file.

    echo "hello world" | rclone rcat remote:path/to/file
    ffmpeg - | rclone rcat remote:path/to/file

If the remote file already exists, it will be overwritten.

rcat will try to upload small files in a single request, which is
usually more efficient than the streaming/chunked upload endpoints,
which use multiple requests. Exact behaviour depends on the remote. What
is considered a small file may be set through --streaming-upload-cutoff.
Uploading only starts after the cutoff is reached or if the file ends
before that. The data must fit into RAM. The cutoff needs to be small
enough to adhere the limits of your remote, please see there. Generally
speaking, setting this cutoff too high will decrease your performance.

Use the |--size| flag to preallocate the file in advance at the remote
end and actually stream it, even if remote backend doesn't support
streaming.

|--size| should be the exact size of the input stream in bytes. If the
size of the stream is different in length to the |--size| passed in then
the transfer will likely fail.

Note that the upload can also not be retried because the data is not
kept around until the upload succeeds. If you need to transfer a lot of
data, you're better off caching locally and then rclone move it to the
destination.

    rclone rcat remote:path [flags]

Options

      -h, --help       help for rcat
          --size int   File size hint to preallocate (default -1)

rclone rcd

Run rclone listening to remote control commands only.

Synopsis

This runs rclone so that it only listens to remote control commands.

This is useful if you are controlling rclone via the rc API.

If you pass in a path to a directory, rclone will serve that directory
for GET requests on the URL passed in. It will also open the URL in the
browser when rclone is run.

See the rc documentation for more info on the rc flags.

    rclone rcd <path to files to serve>* [flags]

Options

      -h, --help   help for rcd

rclone rmdirs

Remove empty directories under the path.

Synopsis

This recursively removes any empty directories (including directories
that only contain empty directories), that it finds under the path. The
root path itself will also be removed if it is empty, unless you supply
the --leave-root flag.

Use command rmdir to delete just the empty directory given by path, not
recurse.

This is useful for tidying up remotes that rclone has left a lot of
empty directories in. For example the delete command will delete files
but leave the directory structure (unless used with option --rmdirs).

To delete a path and any objects in it, use purge command.

    rclone rmdirs remote:path [flags]

Options

      -h, --help         help for rmdirs
          --leave-root   Do not remove root directory if empty

rclone selfupdate

Update the rclone binary.

Synopsis

This command downloads the latest release of rclone and replaces the
currently running binary. The download is verified with a hashsum and
cryptographically signed signature.

If used without flags (or with implied --stable flag), this command will
install the latest stable release. However, some issues may be fixed (or
features added) only in the latest beta release. In such cases you
should run the command with the --beta flag, i.e.
rclone selfupdate --beta. You can check in advance what version would be
installed by adding the --check flag, then repeat the command without it
when you are satisfied.

Sometimes the rclone team may recommend you a concrete beta or stable
rclone release to troubleshoot your issue or add a bleeding edge
feature. The --version VER flag, if given, will update to the concrete
version instead of the latest one. If you omit micro version from VER
(for example 1.53), the latest matching micro version will be used.

Upon successful update rclone will print a message that contains a
previous version number. You will need it if you later decide to revert
your update for some reason. Then you'll have to note the previous
version and run the following command:
rclone selfupdate [--beta] OLDVER. If the old version contains only dots
and digits (for example v1.54.0) then it's a stable release so you won't
need the --beta flag. Beta releases have an additional information
similar to v1.54.0-beta.5111.06f1c0c61. (if you are a developer and use
a locally built rclone, the version number will end with -DEV, you will
have to rebuild it as it obviously can't be distributed).

If you previously installed rclone via a package manager, the package
may include local documentation or configure services. You may wish to
update with the flag --package deb or --package rpm (whichever is
correct for your OS) to update these too. This command with the default
--package zip will update only the rclone executable so the local manual
may become inaccurate after it.

The rclone mount command (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) may
or may not support extended FUSE options depending on the build and OS.
selfupdate will refuse to update if the capability would be discarded.

Note: Windows forbids deletion of a currently running executable so this
command will rename the old executable to 'rclone.old.exe' upon success.

Please note that this command was not available before rclone version
1.55. If it fails for you with the message unknown command "selfupdate"
then you will need to update manually following the install instructions
located at https://rclone.org/install/

    rclone selfupdate [flags]

Options

          --beta             Install beta release

          --output string    Save the downloaded binary at a given path (default: replace running binary)
          --package string   Package format: zip|deb|rpm (default: zip)
          --stable           Install stable release (this is the default)

Synopsis

rclone serve is used to serve a remote over a given protocol. This
command requires the use of a subcommand to specify the protocol, e.g.

    rclone serve http remote:

Each subcommand has its own options which you can see in their help.

rclone serve dlna

Serve remote:path over DLNA

Synopsis

rclone serve dlna is a DLNA media server for media stored in an rclone
remote. Many devices, such as the Xbox and PlayStation, can
automatically discover this server in the LAN and play audio/video from
it. VLC is also supported. Service discovery uses UDP multicast packets
(SSDP) and will thus only work on LANs.

Rclone will list all files present in the remote, without filtering
based on media formats or file extensions. Additionally, there is no
media transcoding support. This means that some players might show files
that they are not able to play back correctly.

Server options

Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should listen
on, e.g. --addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all IPs.

Use --name to choose the friendly server name, which is by default
"rclone (hostname)".

Use --log-trace in conjunction with -vv to enable additional debug
logging of all UPNP traffic.

VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing
system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS
layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing
this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

VFS Directory Cache

Using the --dir-cache-time flag, you can control how long a directory
should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend.
Changes made through the mount will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface
or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up
within the polling interval.

You can send a SIGHUP signal to rclone for it to flush all directory
caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone
instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

VFS File Buffering

The --buffer-size flag determines the amount of memory, that will be
used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer
will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
--buffer-size * open files.

VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with -vv rclone will print the location of the file cache. The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with --cache-dir or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by --vfs-cache-mode. The higher
the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using
disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
and if they haven't been accessed for --vfs-write-back seconds. If
rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will
be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.

If using --vfs-cache-max-size note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every
--vfs-cache-poll-interval. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted
from the cache.

You should not run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with
the same or overlapping remotes if using --vfs-cache-mode > off. This
can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around
this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with --cache-dir. You
don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.

--vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote
and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

-   Files can't be opened for both read AND write
-   Files opened for write can't be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
-   Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
-   Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
-   If an upload fails it can't be retried

--vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write
will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

-   Files opened for write only can't be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
-   If an upload fails it can't be retried

--vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

--vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will
keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to --vfs-cache-mode writes.

When reading a file rclone will read --buffer-size plus --vfs-read-ahead
bytes ahead. The --buffer-size is buffered in memory whereas the
--vfs-read-ahead is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that --buffer-size is not set too
large and --vfs-read-ahead is set large if required.

IMPORTANT not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory
is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an
ERROR message if one is detected.

VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk
specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by
requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the
cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size --vfs-read-chunk-size, and
then double the size for each read. When --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit is
specified, and greater than --vfs-read-chunk-size, the chunk size for
each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is
reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is
disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.

With --vfs-read-chunk-size 100M and --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0 the
following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M,
300M-400M and so on. When --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M is specified,
the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M,
1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting --vfs-read-chunk-size to 0 or "off" disables chunked reading.

VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the chunked reading feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the --no-modtime flag (or
use --use-server-modtime for a slightly different effect) as each read
of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Mount read-only.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than
seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write
to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk
cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (--vfs-cache-mode with value writes or
full), the global flag --transfers can be set to adjust the number of
parallel uploads of modified files from cache (the related global flag
--checkers have no effect on mount).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case
used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to
query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ
only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to
make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The --vfs-case-insensitive mount flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the
mounted file system as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a
value on command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system. If an argument
refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of
the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with
exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case
exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens
only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names
created anew by rclone is controlled by an underlying mounted file
system.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by
rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to
satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and
macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then
it is "true".

Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running df on the
filesystem, then pass the flag --vfs-used-is-size to rclone. With this
flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information,
rclone will scan the whole remote similar to rclone size and compute the
total used space itself.

WARNING. Contrary to rclone size, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots
of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and
only with caching.

rclone serve docker

Serve any remote on docker's volume plugin API.

Synopsis

This command implements the Docker volume plugin API allowing docker to
use rclone as a data storage mechanism for various cloud providers.
rclone provides docker volume plugin based on it.

To create a docker plugin, one must create a Unix or TCP socket that
Docker will look for when you use the plugin and then it listens for
commands from docker daemon and runs the corresponding code when
necessary. Docker plugins can run as a managed plugin under control of
the docker daemon or as an independent native service. For testing, you
can just run it directly from the command line, for example:

    sudo rclone serve docker --base-dir /tmp/rclone-volumes --socket-addr localhost:8787 -vv

Running rclone serve docker will create the said socket, listening for
commands from Docker to create the necessary Volumes. Normally you need
not give the --socket-addr flag. The API will listen on the unix domain
socket at /run/docker/plugins/rclone.sock. In the example above rclone
will create a TCP socket and a small file
/etc/docker/plugins/rclone.spec containing the socket address. We use
sudo because both paths are writeable only by the root user.

If you later decide to change listening socket, the docker daemon must
be restarted to reconnect to /run/docker/plugins/rclone.sock or parse
new /etc/docker/plugins/rclone.spec. Until you restart, any volume
related docker commands will timeout trying to access the old socket.
Running directly is supported on Linux only, not on Windows or MacOS.
This is not a problem with managed plugin mode described in details in
the full documentation.

The command will create volume mounts under the path given by --base-dir
(by default /var/lib/docker-volumes/rclone available only to root) and
maintain the JSON formatted file docker-plugin.state in the rclone cache
directory with book-keeping records of created and mounted volumes.

All mount and VFS options are submitted by the docker daemon via API,
but you can also provide defaults on the command line as well as set
path to the config file and cache directory or adjust logging verbosity.

VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing
system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS
layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing
this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

VFS Directory Cache

Using the --dir-cache-time flag, you can control how long a directory
should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend.
Changes made through the mount will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface
or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up
within the polling interval.

You can send a SIGHUP signal to rclone for it to flush all directory
caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone
instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

VFS File Buffering

The --buffer-size flag determines the amount of memory, that will be
used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer
will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
--buffer-size * open files.

VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with -vv rclone will print the location of the file cache. The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with --cache-dir or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by --vfs-cache-mode. The higher
the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using
disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
and if they haven't been accessed for --vfs-write-back seconds. If
rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will
be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.

If using --vfs-cache-max-size note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every
--vfs-cache-poll-interval. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted
from the cache.

You should not run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with
the same or overlapping remotes if using --vfs-cache-mode > off. This
can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around
this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with --cache-dir. You
don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.

--vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote
and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

--vfs-cache-mode writes

remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.

300M-400M and so on. When --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M is specified,
the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M,
1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting --vfs-read-chunk-size to 0 or "off" disables chunked reading.

When using VFS write caching (--vfs-cache-mode with value writes or

rclone serve ftp

Serve remote:path over FTP.

Synopsis

rclone serve ftp implements a basic ftp server to serve the remote over
FTP protocol. This can be viewed with a ftp client or you can make a
remote of type ftp to read and write it.

Server options

Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should listen
on, e.g. --addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all IPs. By
default it only listens on localhost. You can use port :0 to let the OS
choose an available port.

If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can set a single username and password with the --user and --pass
flags.

VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing
system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS
layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing
this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

VFS Directory Cache

Using the --dir-cache-time flag, you can control how long a directory
should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend.
Changes made through the mount will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface
or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up
within the polling interval.

You can send a SIGHUP signal to rclone for it to flush all directory
caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone
instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

VFS File Buffering

The --buffer-size flag determines the amount of memory, that will be
used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer
will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
--buffer-size * open files.

VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with -vv rclone will print the location of the file cache. The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with --cache-dir or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by --vfs-cache-mode. The higher
the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using
disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
and if they haven't been accessed for --vfs-write-back seconds. If
rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will
be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.

If using --vfs-cache-max-size note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every
--vfs-cache-poll-interval. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted
from the cache.

You should not run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with
the same or overlapping remotes if using --vfs-cache-mode > off. This
can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around
this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with --cache-dir. You
don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.

--vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote
and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

-   Files can't be opened for both read AND write
-   Files opened for write can't be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
-   Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
-   Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
-   If an upload fails it can't be retried

--vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write
will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

-   Files opened for write only can't be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
-   If an upload fails it can't be retried

--vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

--vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will
keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to --vfs-cache-mode writes.

When reading a file rclone will read --buffer-size plus --vfs-read-ahead
bytes ahead. The --buffer-size is buffered in memory whereas the
--vfs-read-ahead is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that --buffer-size is not set too
large and --vfs-read-ahead is set large if required.

IMPORTANT not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory
is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an
ERROR message if one is detected.

VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk
specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by
requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the
cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size --vfs-read-chunk-size, and
then double the size for each read. When --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit is
specified, and greater than --vfs-read-chunk-size, the chunk size for
each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is
reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is
disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.

With --vfs-read-chunk-size 100M and --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0 the
following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M,
300M-400M and so on. When --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M is specified,
the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M,
1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting --vfs-read-chunk-size to 0 or "off" disables chunked reading.

VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the chunked reading feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the --no-modtime flag (or
use --use-server-modtime for a slightly different effect) as each read
of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Mount read-only.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than
seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write
to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk
cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (--vfs-cache-mode with value writes or
full), the global flag --transfers can be set to adjust the number of
parallel uploads of modified files from cache (the related global flag
--checkers have no effect on mount).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case
used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to
query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ
only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to
make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The --vfs-case-insensitive mount flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the
mounted file system as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a
value on command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system. If an argument
refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of
the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with
exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case
exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens
only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names
created anew by rclone is controlled by an underlying mounted file
system.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by
rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to
satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and
macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then
it is "true".

Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running df on the
filesystem, then pass the flag --vfs-used-is-size to rclone. With this
flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information,
rclone will scan the whole remote similar to rclone size and compute the
total used space itself.

WARNING. Contrary to rclone size, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots
of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and
only with caching.

Auth Proxy

If you supply the parameter --auth-proxy /path/to/program then rclone
will use that program to generate backends on the fly which then are
used to authenticate incoming requests. This uses a simple JSON based
protocol with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.

PLEASE NOTE: --auth-proxy and --authorized-keys cannot be used together,
if --auth-proxy is set the authorized keys option will be ignored.

There is an example program bin/test_proxy.py in the rclone source code.

The program's job is to take a user and pass on the input and turn those
into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format. This config will
have any default parameters for the backend added, but it won't use
configuration from environment variables or command line options - it is
the job of the proxy program to make a complete config.

This config generated must have this extra parameter - _root - root to
use for the backend

And it may have this parameter - _obscure - comma separated strings for
parameters to obscure

If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

    {
        "user": "me",
        "pass": "mypassword"
    }

If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

    {
        "user": "me",
        "public_key": "AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf"
    }

And as an example return this on STDOUT

    {
        "type": "sftp",
        "_root": "",
        "_obscure": "pass",
        "user": "me",
        "pass": "mypassword",
        "host": "sftp.example.com"
    }

This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the
user and pass/public_key returned in the output to the host given. Note
that since _obscure is set to pass, rclone will obscure the pass
parameter before creating the backend (which is required for sftp
backends).

The program can manipulate the supplied user in any way, for example to
make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the user be
user@example.com and then set the host to example.com in the output and
the user to user. For security you'd probably want to restrict the host
to a limited list.

Note that an internal cache is keyed on user so only use that for
configuration, don't use pass or public_key. This also means that if a
user's password or public-key is changed the cache will need to expire
(which takes 5 mins) before it takes effect.

This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.

rclone serve http

Serve the remote over HTTP.

Synopsis

rclone serve http implements a basic web server to serve the remote over
HTTP. This can be viewed in a web browser or you can make a remote of
type http read from it.

You can use the filter flags (e.g. --include, --exclude) to control what
is served.

The server will log errors. Use -v to see access logs.

--bwlimit will be respected for file transfers. Use --stats to control
the stats printing.

Server options

Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should listen
on, eg --addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all IPs. By
default it only listens on localhost. You can use port :0 to let the OS
choose an available port.

If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

--server-read-timeout and --server-write-timeout can be used to control
the timeouts on the server. Note that this is the total time for a
transfer.

--max-header-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.

--baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from. By default
rclone will serve from the root. If you used --baseurl "/rclone" then
rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/". This is useful
if you wish to proxy rclone serve. Rclone automatically inserts leading
and trailing "/" on --baseurl, so --baseurl "rclone", --baseurl
"/rclone" and --baseurl "/rclone/" are all treated identically.

SSL/TLS

By default this will serve over http. If you want you can serve over
https. You will need to supply the --cert and --key flags. If you wish
to do client side certificate validation then you will need to supply
--client-ca also.

--cert should be a either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation
of that with the CA certificate. --key should be the PEM encoded private
key and --client-ca should be the PEM encoded client certificate
authority certificate.

Template

--template allows a user to specify a custom markup template for http
and webdav serve functions. The server exports the following markup to
be used within the template to server pages:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Parameter                           Description
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  .Name                               The full path of a file/directory.

  .Title                              Directory listing of .Name

  .Sort                               The current sort used. This is
                                      changeable via ?sort= parameter

                                      Sort Options:
                                      namedirfirst,name,size,time
                                      (default namedirfirst)

  .Order                              The current ordering used. This is
                                      changeable via ?order= parameter

                                      Order Options: asc,desc (default
                                      asc)

  .Query                              Currently unused.

  .Breadcrumb                         Allows for creating a relative
                                      navigation

  -- .Link                            The relative to the root link of
                                      the Text.

  -- .Text                            The Name of the directory.

  .Entries                            Information about a specific
                                      file/directory.

  -- .URL                             The 'url' of an entry.

  -- .Leaf                            Currently same as 'URL' but
                                      intended to be 'just' the name.

  -- .IsDir                           Boolean for if an entry is a
                                      directory or not.

  -- .Size                            Size in Bytes of the entry.

  -- .ModTime                         The UTC timestamp of an entry.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the --user and --pass flags.

Use --htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file. This is in
standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic
authentication. Bcrypt is recommended.

To create an htpasswd file:

    touch htpasswd
    htpasswd -B htpasswd user
    htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser

The password file can be updated while rclone is running.

Use --realm to set the authentication realm.

Use --salt to change the password hashing salt from the default.

VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing
system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS
layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing
this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

VFS Directory Cache

Using the --dir-cache-time flag, you can control how long a directory
should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend.
Changes made through the mount will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface
or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up
within the polling interval.

You can send a SIGHUP signal to rclone for it to flush all directory
caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone
instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

VFS File Buffering

The --buffer-size flag determines the amount of memory, that will be
used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer
will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
--buffer-size * open files.

VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with -vv rclone will print the location of the file cache. The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with --cache-dir or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by --vfs-cache-mode. The higher
the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using
disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
and if they haven't been accessed for --vfs-write-back seconds. If
rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will
be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.

If using --vfs-cache-max-size note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every
--vfs-cache-poll-interval. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted
from the cache.

You should not run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with
the same or overlapping remotes if using --vfs-cache-mode > off. This
can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around
this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with --cache-dir. You
don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.

--vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote
and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

-   Files can't be opened for both read AND write
-   Files opened for write can't be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
-   Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
-   Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
-   If an upload fails it can't be retried

--vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write
will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

-   Files opened for write only can't be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
-   If an upload fails it can't be retried

--vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

--vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will
keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to --vfs-cache-mode writes.

When reading a file rclone will read --buffer-size plus --vfs-read-ahead
bytes ahead. The --buffer-size is buffered in memory whereas the
--vfs-read-ahead is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that --buffer-size is not set too
large and --vfs-read-ahead is set large if required.

IMPORTANT not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory
is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an
ERROR message if one is detected.

VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk
specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by
requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the
cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size --vfs-read-chunk-size, and
then double the size for each read. When --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit is
specified, and greater than --vfs-read-chunk-size, the chunk size for
each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is
reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is
disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.

With --vfs-read-chunk-size 100M and --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0 the
following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M,
300M-400M and so on. When --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M is specified,
the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M,
1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting --vfs-read-chunk-size to 0 or "off" disables chunked reading.

VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the chunked reading feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the --no-modtime flag (or
use --use-server-modtime for a slightly different effect) as each read
of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Mount read-only.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than
seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write
to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk
cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (--vfs-cache-mode with value writes or
full), the global flag --transfers can be set to adjust the number of
parallel uploads of modified files from cache (the related global flag
--checkers have no effect on mount).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case
used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to
query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ
only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to
make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The --vfs-case-insensitive mount flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the
mounted file system as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a
value on command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system. If an argument
refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of
the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with
exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case
exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens
only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names
created anew by rclone is controlled by an underlying mounted file
system.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by
rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to
satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and
macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then
it is "true".

Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running df on the
filesystem, then pass the flag --vfs-used-is-size to rclone. With this
flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information,
rclone will scan the whole remote similar to rclone size and compute the
total used space itself.

WARNING. Contrary to rclone size, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots
of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and
only with caching.

rclone serve restic

Serve the remote for restic's REST API.

Synopsis

rclone serve restic implements restic's REST backend API over HTTP. This
allows restic to use rclone as a data storage mechanism for cloud
providers that restic does not support directly.

Restic is a command-line program for doing backups.

The server will log errors. Use -v to see access logs.

--bwlimit will be respected for file transfers. Use --stats to control
the stats printing.

Setting up rclone for use by restic

First set up a remote for your chosen cloud provider.

Once you have set up the remote, check it is working with, for example
"rclone lsd remote:". You may have called the remote something other
than "remote:" - just substitute whatever you called it in the following
instructions.

Now start the rclone restic server

    rclone serve restic -v remote:backup

Where you can replace "backup" in the above by whatever path in the
remote you wish to use.

By default this will serve on "localhost:8080" you can change this with
use of the "--addr" flag.

You might wish to start this server on boot.

Adding --cache-objects=false will cause rclone to stop caching objects
returned from the List call. Caching is normally desirable as it speeds
up downloading objects, saves transactions and uses very little memory.

Setting up restic to use rclone

Now you can follow the restic instructions on setting up restic.

Note that you will need restic 0.8.2 or later to interoperate with
rclone.

For the example above you will want to use "http://localhost:8080/" as
the URL for the REST server.

For example:

    $ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/
    $ export RESTIC_PASSWORD=yourpassword
    $ restic init
    created restic backend 8b1a4b56ae at rest:http://localhost:8080/

    Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access
    the repository. Losing your password means that your data is
    irrecoverably lost.
    $ restic backup /path/to/files/to/backup
    scan [/path/to/files/to/backup]
    scanned 189 directories, 312 files in 0:00

Multiple repositories

Note that you can use the endpoint to host multiple repositories. Do
this by adding a directory name or path after the URL. Note that these
must end with /. Eg

    $ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user1repo/
    # backup user1 stuff
    $ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user2repo/
    # backup user2 stuff

Private repositories

The "--private-repos" flag can be used to limit users to repositories
starting with a path of /<username>/.

Server options

Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should listen
on, e.g. --addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all IPs. By
default it only listens on localhost. You can use port :0 to let the OS
choose an available port.

If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

--server-read-timeout and --server-write-timeout can be used to control
the timeouts on the server. Note that this is the total time for a
transfer.

--max-header-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.

--baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from. By default
rclone will serve from the root. If you used --baseurl "/rclone" then
rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/". This is useful
if you wish to proxy rclone serve. Rclone automatically inserts leading
and trailing "/" on --baseurl, so --baseurl "rclone", --baseurl
"/rclone" and --baseurl "/rclone/" are all treated identically.

--template allows a user to specify a custom markup template for http
and webdav serve functions. The server exports the following markup to
be used within the template to server pages:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Parameter                           Description
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  .Name                               The full path of a file/directory.

                                      changeable via ?sort= parameter

                                      Sort Options:
                                      namedirfirst,name,size,time
                                      (default namedirfirst)

                                      file/directory.

  -- .URL                             The 'url' of an entry.

  -- .Leaf                            Currently same as 'URL' but
                                      intended to be 'just' the name.

  -- .ModTime                         The UTC timestamp of an entry.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the --user and --pass flags.

Use --htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file. This is in
standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic
authentication. Bcrypt is recommended.

To create an htpasswd file:

    touch htpasswd
    htpasswd -B htpasswd user
    htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser

The password file can be updated while rclone is running.

Use --realm to set the authentication realm.

SSL/TLS

By default this will serve over http. If you want you can serve over
https. You will need to supply the --cert and --key flags. If you wish
to do client side certificate validation then you will need to supply
--client-ca also.

--cert should be either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation of
that with the CA certificate. --key should be the PEM encoded private
key and --client-ca should be the PEM encoded client certificate
authority certificate.

rclone serve sftp

Serve the remote over SFTP.

Synopsis

rclone serve sftp implements an SFTP server to serve the remote over
SFTP. This can be used with an SFTP client or you can make a remote of
type sftp to use with it.

You can use the filter flags (e.g. --include, --exclude) to control what
is served.

The server will log errors. Use -v to see access logs.

--bwlimit will be respected for file transfers. Use --stats to control
the stats printing.

You must provide some means of authentication, either with
--user/--pass, an authorized keys file (specify location with
--authorized-keys - the default is the same as ssh), an --auth-proxy, or
set the --no-auth flag for no authentication when logging in.

Note that this also implements a small number of shell commands so that
it can provide md5sum/sha1sum/df information for the rclone sftp
backend. This means that is can support SHA1SUMs, MD5SUMs and the about
command when paired with the rclone sftp backend.

If you don't supply a host --key then rclone will generate rsa, ecdsa
and ed25519 variants, and cache them for later use in rclone's cache
directory (see "rclone help flags cache-dir") in the "serve-sftp"
directory.

By default the server binds to localhost:2022 - if you want it to be
reachable externally then supply "--addr :2022" for example.

Note that the default of "--vfs-cache-mode off" is fine for the rclone
sftp backend, but it may not be with other SFTP clients.

If --stdio is specified, rclone will serve SFTP over stdio, which can be
used with sshd via ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, for example:

    restrict,command="rclone serve sftp --stdio ./photos" ssh-rsa ...

On the client you need to set "--transfers 1" when using --stdio.
Otherwise multiple instances of the rclone server are started by OpenSSH
which can lead to "corrupted on transfer" errors. This is the case
because the client chooses indiscriminately which server to send
commands to while the servers all have different views of the state of
the filing system.

The "restrict" in authorized_keys prevents SHA1SUMs and MD5SUMs from
beeing used. Omitting "restrict" and using --sftp-path-override to
enable checksumming is possible but less secure and you could use the
SFTP server provided by OpenSSH in this case.

VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing
system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS
layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing
this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

VFS Directory Cache

Using the --dir-cache-time flag, you can control how long a directory
should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend.
Changes made through the mount will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface
or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up
within the polling interval.

You can send a SIGHUP signal to rclone for it to flush all directory
caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone
instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

VFS File Buffering

The --buffer-size flag determines the amount of memory, that will be
used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer
will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
--buffer-size * open files.

VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with -vv rclone will print the location of the file cache. The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with --cache-dir or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by --vfs-cache-mode. The higher
the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using
disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
and if they haven't been accessed for --vfs-write-back seconds. If
rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will
be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.

If using --vfs-cache-max-size note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every
--vfs-cache-poll-interval. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted
from the cache.

You should not run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with
the same or overlapping remotes if using --vfs-cache-mode > off. This
can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around
this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with --cache-dir. You
don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.

--vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote
and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

-   Files can't be opened for both read AND write
-   Files opened for write can't be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
-   Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
-   Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
-   If an upload fails it can't be retried

--vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write
will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

-   Files opened for write only can't be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
-   If an upload fails it can't be retried

--vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

--vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will
keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to --vfs-cache-mode writes.

When reading a file rclone will read --buffer-size plus --vfs-read-ahead
bytes ahead. The --buffer-size is buffered in memory whereas the
--vfs-read-ahead is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that --buffer-size is not set too
large and --vfs-read-ahead is set large if required.

IMPORTANT not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory
is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an
ERROR message if one is detected.

VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk
specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by
requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the
cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size --vfs-read-chunk-size, and
then double the size for each read. When --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit is
specified, and greater than --vfs-read-chunk-size, the chunk size for
each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is
reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is
disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.

With --vfs-read-chunk-size 100M and --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0 the
following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M,
300M-400M and so on. When --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M is specified,
the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M,
1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting --vfs-read-chunk-size to 0 or "off" disables chunked reading.

VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the chunked reading feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the --no-modtime flag (or
use --use-server-modtime for a slightly different effect) as each read
of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Mount read-only.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than
seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write
to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk
cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (--vfs-cache-mode with value writes or
full), the global flag --transfers can be set to adjust the number of
parallel uploads of modified files from cache (the related global flag
--checkers have no effect on mount).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case
used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to
query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ
only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to
make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The --vfs-case-insensitive mount flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the
mounted file system as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a
value on command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system. If an argument
refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of
the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with
exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case
exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens
only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names
created anew by rclone is controlled by an underlying mounted file
system.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by
rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to
satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and
macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then
it is "true".

Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running df on the
filesystem, then pass the flag --vfs-used-is-size to rclone. With this
flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information,
rclone will scan the whole remote similar to rclone size and compute the
total used space itself.

WARNING. Contrary to rclone size, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots
of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and
only with caching.

Auth Proxy

If you supply the parameter --auth-proxy /path/to/program then rclone
will use that program to generate backends on the fly which then are
used to authenticate incoming requests. This uses a simple JSON based
protocol with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.

PLEASE NOTE: --auth-proxy and --authorized-keys cannot be used together,
if --auth-proxy is set the authorized keys option will be ignored.

There is an example program bin/test_proxy.py in the rclone source code.

The program's job is to take a user and pass on the input and turn those
into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format. This config will
have any default parameters for the backend added, but it won't use
configuration from environment variables or command line options - it is
the job of the proxy program to make a complete config.

This config generated must have this extra parameter - _root - root to
use for the backend

And it may have this parameter - _obscure - comma separated strings for
parameters to obscure

If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

    {
        "user": "me",
        "pass": "mypassword"
    }

If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

    {
        "user": "me",
        "public_key": "AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf"
    }

And as an example return this on STDOUT

    {
        "type": "sftp",
        "_root": "",
        "_obscure": "pass",
        "user": "me",
        "pass": "mypassword",
        "host": "sftp.example.com"
    }

This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the
user and pass/public_key returned in the output to the host given. Note
that since _obscure is set to pass, rclone will obscure the pass
parameter before creating the backend (which is required for sftp
backends).

The program can manipulate the supplied user in any way, for example to
make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the user be
user@example.com and then set the host to example.com in the output and
the user to user. For security you'd probably want to restrict the host
to a limited list.

Note that an internal cache is keyed on user so only use that for
configuration, don't use pass or public_key. This also means that if a
user's password or public-key is changed the cache will need to expire
(which takes 5 mins) before it takes effect.

This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.

rclone serve webdav

Serve remote:path over webdav.

Synopsis

rclone serve webdav implements a basic webdav server to serve the remote
over HTTP via the webdav protocol. This can be viewed with a webdav
client, through a web browser, or you can make a remote of type webdav
to read and write it.

Webdav options

--etag-hash

This controls the ETag header. Without this flag the ETag will be based
on the ModTime and Size of the object.

If this flag is set to "auto" then rclone will choose the first
supported hash on the backend or you can use a named hash such as "MD5"
or "SHA-1".

Use "rclone hashsum" to see the full list.

Server options

Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should listen
on, e.g. --addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all IPs. By
default it only listens on localhost. You can use port :0 to let the OS
choose an available port.

If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

--server-read-timeout and --server-write-timeout can be used to control
the timeouts on the server. Note that this is the total time for a
transfer.

--max-header-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.

--baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from. By default
rclone will serve from the root. If you used --baseurl "/rclone" then
rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/". This is useful
if you wish to proxy rclone serve. Rclone automatically inserts leading
and trailing "/" on --baseurl, so --baseurl "rclone", --baseurl
"/rclone" and --baseurl "/rclone/" are all treated identically.

--template allows a user to specify a custom markup template for http
and webdav serve functions. The server exports the following markup to
be used within the template to server pages:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Parameter                           Description
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  .Name                               The full path of a file/directory.

  .Title                              Directory listing of .Name

  .Sort                               The current sort used. This is
                                      changeable via ?sort= parameter

                                      Sort Options:
                                      namedirfirst,name,size,time
                                      (default namedirfirst)

  .Order                              The current ordering used. This is
                                      changeable via ?order= parameter

                                      Order Options: asc,desc (default
                                      asc)

  .Query                              Currently unused.

  .Breadcrumb                         Allows for creating a relative

  -- .Link                            The relative to the root link of
                                      the Text.

  -- .Text                            The Name of the directory.

                                      file/directory.

  -- .URL                             The 'url' of an entry.

  -- .Leaf                            Currently same as 'URL' but
                                      intended to be 'just' the name.

  -- .IsDir                           Boolean for if an entry is a
                                      directory or not.

  -- .Size                            Size in Bytes of the entry.

  -- .ModTime                         The UTC timestamp of an entry.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the --user and --pass flags.

Use --htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file. This is in
standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic
authentication. Bcrypt is recommended.

To create an htpasswd file:

    touch htpasswd
    htpasswd -B htpasswd user
    htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser

The password file can be updated while rclone is running.

Use --realm to set the authentication realm.

SSL/TLS

By default this will serve over http. If you want you can serve over
https. You will need to supply the --cert and --key flags. If you wish
to do client side certificate validation then you will need to supply
--client-ca also.

--cert should be either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation of
that with the CA certificate. --key should be the PEM encoded private
key and --client-ca should be the PEM encoded client certificate
authority certificate.

VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk filing
system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the VFS
layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of doing
this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

VFS Directory Cache

Using the --dir-cache-time flag, you can control how long a directory
should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend.
Changes made through the mount will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface
or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up
within the polling interval.

You can send a SIGHUP signal to rclone for it to flush all directory
caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one rclone
instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

VFS File Buffering

The --buffer-size flag determines the amount of memory, that will be
used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file. The buffer
will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
--buffer-size * open files.

VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with -vv rclone will print the location of the file cache. The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with --cache-dir or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by --vfs-cache-mode. The higher
the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using
disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
and if they haven't been accessed for --vfs-write-back seconds. If
rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been uploaded, these will
be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.

If using --vfs-cache-max-size note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every
--vfs-cache-poll-interval. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted
from the cache.

You should not run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache with
the same or overlapping remotes if using --vfs-cache-mode > off. This
can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work around
this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with --cache-dir. You
don't need to worry about this if the remotes in use don't overlap.

--vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote
and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

-   Files can't be opened for both read AND write
-   Files opened for write can't be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
-   Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
-   Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
-   If an upload fails it can't be retried

--vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk. This means that files opened for write
will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

-   Files opened for write only can't be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
-   If an upload fails it can't be retried

--vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

--vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will
keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to --vfs-cache-mode writes.

When reading a file rclone will read --buffer-size plus --vfs-read-ahead
bytes ahead. The --buffer-size is buffered in memory whereas the
--vfs-read-ahead is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that --buffer-size is not set too
large and --vfs-read-ahead is set large if required.

IMPORTANT not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory
is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it will log an
ERROR message if one is detected.

VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the chunk
specified. This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by
requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the
cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size --vfs-read-chunk-size, and
then double the size for each read. When --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit is
specified, and greater than --vfs-read-chunk-size, the chunk size for
each open file will get doubled only until the specified value is
reached. If the value is "off", which is the default, the limit is
disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.

With --vfs-read-chunk-size 100M and --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0 the
following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M,
300M-400M and so on. When --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M is specified,
the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M,
1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting --vfs-read-chunk-size to 0 or "off" disables chunked reading.

VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the chunked reading feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the --no-modtime flag (or
use --use-server-modtime for a slightly different effect) as each read
of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Mount read-only.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather than
seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or write
to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk
cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (--vfs-cache-mode with value writes or
full), the global flag --transfers can be set to adjust the number of
parallel uploads of modified files from cache (the related global flag
--checkers have no effect on mount).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case
used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to
query. It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ
only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to
make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The --vfs-case-insensitive mount flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the
mounted file system as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a
value on command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system. If an argument
refers to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of
the existing file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with
exactly the same name is not found but a name differing only by case
exists, rclone will transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens
only when an existing file is requested. Case sensitivity of file names
created anew by rclone is controlled by an underlying mounted file
system.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by
rclone (the source). The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to
satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and
macOS, "false" otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then
it is "true".

Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running df on the
filesystem, then pass the flag --vfs-used-is-size to rclone. With this
flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this information,
rclone will scan the whole remote similar to rclone size and compute the
total used space itself.

WARNING. Contrary to rclone size, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots
of API calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and
only with caching.

Auth Proxy

If you supply the parameter --auth-proxy /path/to/program then rclone
will use that program to generate backends on the fly which then are
used to authenticate incoming requests. This uses a simple JSON based
protocol with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.

PLEASE NOTE: --auth-proxy and --authorized-keys cannot be used together,
if --auth-proxy is set the authorized keys option will be ignored.

There is an example program bin/test_proxy.py in the rclone source code.

The program's job is to take a user and pass on the input and turn those
into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format. This config will
have any default parameters for the backend added, but it won't use
configuration from environment variables or command line options - it is
the job of the proxy program to make a complete config.

This config generated must have this extra parameter - _root - root to
use for the backend

And it may have this parameter - _obscure - comma separated strings for
parameters to obscure

If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

    {
        "user": "me",
        "pass": "mypassword"
    }

If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

    {
        "user": "me",
        "public_key": "AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf"
    }

And as an example return this on STDOUT

    {
        "type": "sftp",
        "_root": "",
        "_obscure": "pass",
        "user": "me",
        "pass": "mypassword",
        "host": "sftp.example.com"
    }

This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the
user and pass/public_key returned in the output to the host given. Note
that since _obscure is set to pass, rclone will obscure the pass
parameter before creating the backend (which is required for sftp
backends).

The program can manipulate the supplied user in any way, for example to
make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the user be
user@example.com and then set the host to example.com in the output and
the user to user. For security you'd probably want to restrict the host
to a limited list.

Note that an internal cache is keyed on user so only use that for
configuration, don't use pass or public_key. This also means that if a
user's password or public-key is changed the cache will need to expire
(which takes 5 mins) before it takes effect.

This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.

rclone settier

Changes storage class/tier of objects in remote.

Synopsis

rclone settier changes storage tier or class at remote if supported. Few
cloud storage services provides different storage classes on objects,
for example AWS S3 and Glacier, Azure Blob storage - Hot, Cool and
Archive, Google Cloud Storage, Regional Storage, Nearline, Coldline etc.

Note that, certain tier changes make objects not available to access
immediately. For example tiering to archive in azure blob storage makes
objects in frozen state, user can restore by setting tier to Hot/Cool,
similarly S3 to Glacier makes object inaccessible.true

You can use it to tier single object

    rclone settier Cool remote:path/file

Or use rclone filters to set tier on only specific files

    rclone --include "*.txt" settier Hot remote:path/dir

Or just provide remote directory and all files in directory will be
tiered

    rclone settier tier remote:path/dir

rclone touch

Create new file or change file modification time.

Synopsis

Set the modification time on file(s) as specified by remote:path to have
the current time.

If remote:path does not exist then a zero sized file will be created,
unless --no-create or --recursive is provided.

If --recursive is used then recursively sets the modification time on
all existing files that is found under the path. Filters are supported,
and you can test with the --dry-run or the --interactive flag.

If --timestamp is used then sets the modification time to that time
instead of the current time. Times may be specified as one of:

-   'YYMMDD' - e.g. 17.10.30
-   'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS' - e.g. 2006-01-02T15:04:05
-   'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSS' - e.g. 2006-01-02T15:04:05.123456789

Note that value of --timestamp is in UTC. If you want local time then
add the --localtime flag.

    rclone touch remote:path [flags]

Options

      -h, --help               help for touch
          --localtime          Use localtime for timestamp, not UTC
      -C, --no-create          Do not create the file if it does not exist (implied with --recursive)
      -R, --recursive          Recursively touch all files
      -t, --timestamp string   Use specified time instead of the current time of day

rclone tree

List the contents of the remote in a tree like fashion.

Synopsis

rclone tree lists the contents of a remote in a similar way to the unix
tree command.

For example

    $ rclone tree remote:path
    /
    ├── file1
    ├── file2
    ├── file3
    └── subdir
        ├── file4
        └── file5

    1 directories, 5 files

You can use any of the filtering options with the tree command (e.g.
--include and --exclude). You can also use --fast-list.

The tree command has many options for controlling the listing which are
compatible with the tree command. Note that not all of them have short
options as they conflict with rclone's short options.

    rclone tree remote:path [flags]

Options

      -a, --all             All files are listed (list . files too)
      -C, --color           Turn colorization on always
      -d, --dirs-only       List directories only
          --dirsfirst       List directories before files (-U disables)
          --full-path       Print the full path prefix for each file
      -h, --help            help for tree
          --level int       Descend only level directories deep
      -D, --modtime         Print the date of last modification.
          --noindent        Don't print indentation lines
          --noreport        Turn off file/directory count at end of tree listing
      -o, --output string   Output to file instead of stdout
      -p, --protections     Print the protections for each file.
      -Q, --quote           Quote filenames with double quotes.
      -s, --size            Print the size in bytes of each file.
          --sort string     Select sort: name,version,size,mtime,ctime
          --sort-ctime      Sort files by last status change time
      -t, --sort-modtime    Sort files by last modification time
      -r, --sort-reverse    Reverse the order of the sort
      -U, --unsorted        Leave files unsorted
          --version         Sort files alphanumerically by version

Copying single files

rclone normally syncs or copies directories. However, if the source
remote points to a file, rclone will just copy that file. The
destination remote must point to a directory - rclone will give the
error
Failed to create file system for "remote:file": is a file not a directory
if it isn't.

For example, suppose you have a remote with a file in called test.jpg,
then you could copy just that file like this

    rclone copy remote:test.jpg /tmp/download

The file test.jpg will be placed inside /tmp/download.

This is equivalent to specifying

    rclone copy --files-from /tmp/files remote: /tmp/download

Where /tmp/files contains the single line

    test.jpg

It is recommended to use copy when copying individual files, not sync.
They have pretty much the same effect but copy will use a lot less
memory.

Syntax of remote paths

The syntax of the paths passed to the rclone command are as follows.

/path/to/dir

This refers to the local file system.

On Windows \ may be used instead of / in local paths only, non local
paths must use /. See local filesystem documentation for more about
Windows-specific paths.

These paths needn't start with a leading / - if they don't then they
will be relative to the current directory.

remote:path/to/dir

This refers to a directory path/to/dir on remote: as defined in the
config file (configured with rclone config).

remote:/path/to/dir

On most backends this is refers to the same directory as
remote:path/to/dir and that format should be preferred. On a very small
number of remotes (FTP, SFTP, Dropbox for business) this will refer to a
different directory. On these, paths without a leading / will refer to
your "home" directory and paths with a leading / will refer to the root.

:backend:path/to/dir

This is an advanced form for creating remotes on the fly. backend should
be the name or prefix of a backend (the type in the config file) and all
the configuration for the backend should be provided on the command line
(or in environment variables).

Here are some examples:

    rclone lsd --http-url https://pub.rclone.org :http:

To list all the directories in the root of https://pub.rclone.org/.

    rclone lsf --http-url https://example.com :http:path/to/dir

To list files and directories in https://example.com/path/to/dir/

    rclone copy --http-url https://example.com :http:path/to/dir /tmp/dir

To copy files and directories in https://example.com/path/to/dir to
/tmp/dir.

    rclone copy --sftp-host example.com :sftp:path/to/dir /tmp/dir

To copy files and directories from example.com in the relative directory
path/to/dir to /tmp/dir using sftp.

Connection strings

The above examples can also be written using a connection string syntax,
so instead of providing the arguments as command line parameters
--http-url https://pub.rclone.org they are provided as part of the
remote specification as a kind of connection string.

    rclone lsd ":http,url='https://pub.rclone.org':"
    rclone lsf ":http,url='https://example.com':path/to/dir"
    rclone copy ":http,url='https://example.com':path/to/dir" /tmp/dir
    rclone copy :sftp,host=example.com:path/to/dir /tmp/dir

These can apply to modify existing remotes as well as create new remotes
with the on the fly syntax. This example is equivalent to adding the
--drive-shared-with-me parameter to the remote gdrive:.

    rclone lsf "gdrive,shared_with_me:path/to/dir"

The major advantage to using the connection string style syntax is that
it only applies to the remote, not to all the remotes of that type of
the command line. A common confusion is this attempt to copy a file
shared on google drive to the normal drive which does not work because
the --drive-shared-with-me flag applies to both the source and the
destination.

    rclone copy --drive-shared-with-me gdrive:shared-file.txt gdrive:

However using the connection string syntax, this does work.

    rclone copy "gdrive,shared_with_me:shared-file.txt" gdrive:

Note that the connection string only affects the options of the
immediate backend. If for example gdriveCrypt is a crypt based on
gdrive, then the following command will not work as intended, because
shared_with_me is ignored by the crypt backend:

    rclone copy "gdriveCrypt,shared_with_me:shared-file.txt" gdriveCrypt:

The connection strings have the following syntax

    remote,parameter=value,parameter2=value2:path/to/dir
    :backend,parameter=value,parameter2=value2:path/to/dir

If the parameter has a : or , then it must be placed in quotes " or ',
so

    remote,parameter="colon:value",parameter2="comma,value":path/to/dir
    :backend,parameter='colon:value',parameter2='comma,value':path/to/dir

If a quoted value needs to include that quote, then it should be
doubled, so

    remote,parameter="with""quote",parameter2='with''quote':path/to/dir

This will make parameter be with"quote and parameter2 be with'quote.

If you leave off the =parameter then rclone will substitute =true which
works very well with flags. For example, to use s3 configured in the
environment you could use:

    rclone lsd :s3,env_auth:

Which is equivalent to

    rclone lsd :s3,env_auth=true:

Note that on the command line you might need to surround these
connection strings with " or ' to stop the shell interpreting any
special characters within them.

If you are a shell master then you'll know which strings are OK and
which aren't, but if you aren't sure then enclose them in " and use ' as
the inside quote. This syntax works on all OSes.

    rclone copy ":http,url='https://example.com':path/to/dir" /tmp/dir

On Linux/macOS some characters are still interpreted inside " strings in
the shell (notably \ and $ and ") so if your strings contain those you
can swap the roles of " and ' thus. (This syntax does not work on
Windows.)

    rclone copy ':http,url="https://example.com":path/to/dir' /tmp/dir

Connection strings, config and logging

If you supply extra configuration to a backend by command line flag,
environment variable or connection string then rclone will add a suffix
based on the hash of the config to the name of the remote, eg

    rclone -vv lsf --s3-chunk-size 20M s3:

Has the log message

    DEBUG : s3: detected overridden config - adding "{Srj1p}" suffix to name

This is so rclone can tell the modified remote apart from the unmodified
remote when caching the backends.

This should only be noticeable in the logs.

This means that on the fly backends such as

    rclone -vv lsf :s3,env_auth:

Will get their own names

    DEBUG : :s3: detected overridden config - adding "{YTu53}" suffix to name

Valid remote names

Remote names are case sensitive, and must adhere to the following rules:
- May only contain 0-9, A-Z, a-z, _, -, . and space. - May not start
with - or space.

Quoting and the shell

When you are typing commands to your computer you are using something
called the command line shell. This interprets various characters in an
OS specific way.

Here are some gotchas which may help users unfamiliar with the shell
rules

Linux / OSX

If your names have spaces or shell metacharacters (e.g. *, ?, $, ', ",
etc.) then you must quote them. Use single quotes ' by default.

    rclone copy 'Important files?' remote:backup

If you want to send a ' you will need to use ", e.g.

    rclone copy "O'Reilly Reviews" remote:backup

The rules for quoting metacharacters are complicated and if you want the
full details you'll have to consult the manual page for your shell.

Windows

If your names have spaces in you need to put them in ", e.g.

    rclone copy "E:\folder name\folder name\folder name" remote:backup

If you are using the root directory on its own then don't quote it (see
#464 for why), e.g.

    rclone copy E:\ remote:backup

Copying files or directories with : in the names

rclone uses : to mark a remote name. This is, however, a valid filename
component in non-Windows OSes. The remote name parser will only search
for a : up to the first / so if you need to act on a file or directory
like this then use the full path starting with a /, or use ./ as a
current directory prefix.

So to sync a directory called sync:me to a remote called remote: use

    rclone sync -i ./sync:me remote:path

or

    rclone sync -i /full/path/to/sync:me remote:path

Server Side Copy

Most remotes (but not all - see the overview) support server-side copy.

This means if you want to copy one folder to another then rclone won't
download all the files and re-upload them; it will instruct the server
to copy them in place.

Eg

    rclone copy s3:oldbucket s3:newbucket

Will copy the contents of oldbucket to newbucket without downloading and
re-uploading.

Remotes which don't support server-side copy will download and re-upload
in this case.

Server side copies are used with sync and copy and will be identified in
the log when using the -v flag. The move command may also use them if
remote doesn't support server-side move directly. This is done by
issuing a server-side copy then a delete which is much quicker than a
download and re-upload.

Server side copies will only be attempted if the remote names are the
same.

This can be used when scripting to make aged backups efficiently, e.g.

    rclone sync -i remote:current-backup remote:previous-backup
    rclone sync -i /path/to/files remote:current-backup

Options

Rclone has a number of options to control its behaviour.

Options that take parameters can have the values passed in two ways,
--option=value or --option value. However boolean (true/false) options
behave slightly differently to the other options in that --boolean sets
the option to true and the absence of the flag sets it to false. It is
also possible to specify --boolean=false or --boolean=true. Note that
--boolean false is not valid - this is parsed as --boolean and the false
is parsed as an extra command line argument for rclone.

Options which use TIME use the go time parser. A duration string is a
possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction
and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units
are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

Options which use SIZE use KiB (multiples of 1024 bytes) by default.
However, a suffix of B for Byte, K for KiB, M for MiB, G for GiB, T for
TiB and P for PiB may be used. These are the binary units, e.g. 1,
2**10, 2**20, 2**30 respectively.

--backup-dir=DIR

When using sync, copy or move any files which would have been
overwritten or deleted are moved in their original hierarchy into this
directory.

If --suffix is set, then the moved files will have the suffix added to
them. If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has been
added) in DIR, then it will be overwritten.

The remote in use must support server-side move or copy and you must use
the same remote as the destination of the sync. The backup directory
must not overlap the destination directory.

For example

    rclone sync -i /path/to/local remote:current --backup-dir remote:old

will sync /path/to/local to remote:current, but for any files which
would have been updated or deleted will be stored in remote:old.

If running rclone from a script you might want to use today's date as
the directory name passed to --backup-dir to store the old files, or you
might want to pass --suffix with today's date.

See --compare-dest and --copy-dest.

--bind string

Local address to bind to for outgoing connections. This can be an IPv4
address (1.2.3.4), an IPv6 address (1234::789A) or host name. If the
host name doesn't resolve or resolves to more than one IP address it
will give an error.

--bwlimit=BANDWIDTH_SPEC

This option controls the bandwidth limit. For example

    --bwlimit 10M

would mean limit the upload and download bandwidth to 10 MiB/s. NB this
is bytes per second not bits per second. To use a single limit, specify
the desired bandwidth in KiB/s, or use a suffix B|K|M|G|T|P. The default
is 0 which means to not limit bandwidth.

The upload and download bandwidth can be specified seperately, as
--bwlimit UP:DOWN, so

    --bwlimit 10M:100k

would mean limit the upload bandwidth to 10 MiB/s and the download
bandwidth to 100 KiB/s. Either limit can be "off" meaning no limit, so
to just limit the upload bandwidth you would use

    --bwlimit 10M:off

this would limit the upload bandwidth to 10 MiB/s but the download
bandwidth would be unlimited.

When specified as above the bandwidth limits last for the duration of
run of the rclone binary.

It is also possible to specify a "timetable" of limits, which will cause
certain limits to be applied at certain times. To specify a timetable,
format your entries as
WEEKDAY-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH WEEKDAY-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH... where: WEEKDAY is
optional element.

-   BANDWIDTH can be a single number, e.g.100k or a pair of numbers for
    upload:download, e.g.10M:1M.
-   WEEKDAY can be written as the whole word or only using the first 3
    characters. It is optional.
-   HH:MM is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.

An example of a typical timetable to avoid link saturation during
daytime working hours could be:

--bwlimit "08:00,512k 12:00,10M 13:00,512k 18:00,30M 23:00,off"

In this example, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512 KiB/s at 8am
every day. At noon, it will rise to 10 MiB/s, and drop back to 512
KiB/sec at 1pm. At 6pm, the bandwidth limit will be set to 30 MiB/s, and
at 11pm it will be completely disabled (full speed). Anything between
11pm and 8am will remain unlimited.

An example of timetable with WEEKDAY could be:

--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512 Fri-23:59,10M Sat-10:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"

It means that, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512 KiB/s on
Monday. It will rise to 10 MiB/s before the end of Friday. At 10:00 on
Saturday it will be set to 1 MiB/s. From 20:00 on Sunday it will be
unlimited.

Timeslots without WEEKDAY are extended to the whole week. So this
example:

--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512 12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"

Is equivalent to this:

--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512Mon-12:00,1M Tue-12:00,1M Wed-12:00,1M Thu-12:00,1M Fri-12:00,1M Sat-12:00,1M Sun-12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"

Bandwidth limit apply to the data transfer for all backends. For most
backends the directory listing bandwidth is also included (exceptions
being the non HTTP backends, ftp, sftp and storj).

Note that the units are Byte/s, not bit/s. Typically connections are
measured in bit/s - to convert divide by 8. For example, let's say you
have a 10 Mbit/s connection and you wish rclone to use half of it - 5
Mbit/s. This is 5/8 = 0.625 MiB/s so you would use a --bwlimit 0.625M
parameter for rclone.

On Unix systems (Linux, macOS, …) the bandwidth limiter can be toggled
by sending a SIGUSR2 signal to rclone. This allows to remove the
limitations of a long running rclone transfer and to restore it back to
the value specified with --bwlimit quickly when needed. Assuming there
is only one rclone instance running, you can toggle the limiter like
this:

    kill -SIGUSR2 $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use change
the bwlimit dynamically:

    rclone rc core/bwlimit rate=1M

--bwlimit-file=BANDWIDTH_SPEC

This option controls per file bandwidth limit. For the options see the
--bwlimit flag.

For example use this to allow no transfers to be faster than 1 MiB/s

    --bwlimit-file 1M

This can be used in conjunction with --bwlimit.

Note that if a schedule is provided the file will use the schedule in
effect at the start of the transfer.

--buffer-size=SIZE

Use this sized buffer to speed up file transfers. Each --transfer will
use this much memory for buffering.

When using mount or cmount each open file descriptor will use this much
memory for buffering. See the mount documentation for more details.

Set to 0 to disable the buffering for the minimum memory usage.

Note that the memory allocation of the buffers is influenced by the
--use-mmap flag.

--cache-dir=DIR

Specify the directory rclone will use for caching, to override the
default.

Default value is depending on operating system: - Windows
%LocalAppData%\rclone, if LocalAppData is defined. - macOS
$HOME/Library/Caches/rclone if HOME is defined. - Unix
$XDG_CACHE_HOME/rclone if XDG_CACHE_HOME is defined, else
$HOME/.cache/rclone if HOME is defined. - Fallback (on all OS) to
$TMPDIR/rclone, where TMPDIR is the value from --temp-dir.

You can use the config paths command to see the current value.

Cache directory is heavily used by the VFS File Caching mount feature,
but also by serve, GUI and other parts of rclone.

--check-first

If this flag is set then in a sync, copy or move, rclone will do all the
checks to see whether files need to be transferred before doing any of
the transfers. Normally rclone would start running transfers as soon as
possible.

This flag can be useful on IO limited systems where transfers interfere
with checking.

It can also be useful to ensure perfect ordering when using --order-by.

Using this flag can use more memory as it effectively sets --max-backlog
to infinite. This means that all the info on the objects to transfer is
held in memory before the transfers start.

--checkers=N

The number of checkers to run in parallel. Checkers do the equality
checking of files during a sync. For some storage systems (e.g. S3,
Swift, Dropbox) this can take a significant amount of time so they are
run in parallel.

The default is to run 8 checkers in parallel.

-c, --checksum

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal. If you set this flag then rclone will check the file
hash and size to determine if files are equal.

This is useful when the remote doesn't support setting modified time and
a more accurate sync is desired than just checking the file size.

This is very useful when transferring between remotes which store the
same hash type on the object, e.g. Drive and Swift. For details of which
remotes support which hash type see the table in the overview section.

Eg rclone --checksum sync s3:/bucket swift:/bucket would run much
quicker than without the --checksum flag.

When using this flag, rclone won't update mtimes of remote files if they
are incorrect as it would normally.

--compare-dest=DIR

When using sync, copy or move DIR is checked in addition to the
destination for files. If a file identical to the source is found that
file is NOT copied from source. This is useful to copy just files that
have changed since the last backup.

You must use the same remote as the destination of the sync. The compare
directory must not overlap the destination directory.

See --copy-dest and --backup-dir.

--config=CONFIG_FILE

Specify the location of the rclone configuration file, to override the
default. E.g. rclone config --config="rclone.conf".

The exact default is a bit complex to describe, due to changes
introduced through different versions of rclone while preserving
backwards compatibility, but in most cases it is as simple as:

-   %APPDATA%/rclone/rclone.conf on Windows
-   ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf on other

The complete logic is as follows: Rclone will look for an existing
configuration file in any of the following locations, in priority order:

1.  rclone.conf (in program directory, where rclone executable is)
2.  %APPDATA%/rclone/rclone.conf (only on Windows)
3.  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rclone/rclone.conf (on all systems, including
    Windows)
4.  ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf (see below for explanation of ~ symbol)
5.  ~/.rclone.conf

If no existing configuration file is found, then a new one will be
created in the following location:

-   On Windows: Location 2 listed above, except in the unlikely event
    that APPDATA is not defined, then location 4 is used instead.
-   On Unix: Location 3 if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is defined, else location 4.
-   Fallback to location 5 (on all OS), when the rclone directory cannot
    be created, but if also a home directory was not found then path
    .rclone.conf relative to current working directory will be used as a
    final resort.

The ~ symbol in paths above represent the home directory of the current
user on any OS, and the value is defined as following:

-   On Windows: %HOME% if defined, else %USERPROFILE%, or else
    %HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%.
-   On Unix: $HOME if defined, else by looking up current user in
    OS-specific user database (e.g. passwd file), or else use the result
    from shell command cd && pwd.

If you run rclone config file you will see where the default location is
for you.

The fact that an existing file rclone.conf in the same directory as the
rclone executable is always preferred, means that it is easy to run in
"portable" mode by downloading rclone executable to a writable directory
and then create an empty file rclone.conf in the same directory.

If the location is set to empty string "" or path to a file with name
notfound, or the os null device represented by value NUL on Windows and
/dev/null on Unix systems, then rclone will keep the config file in
memory only.

The file format is basic INI: Sections of text, led by a [section]
header and followed by key=value entries on separate lines. In rclone
each remote is represented by its own section, where the section name
defines the name of the remote. Options are specified as the key=value
entries, where the key is the option name without the --backend- prefix,
in lowercase and with _ instead of -. E.g. option --mega-hard-delete
corresponds to key hard_delete. Only backend options can be specified. A
special, and required, key type identifies the storage system, where the
value is the internal lowercase name as returned by command
rclone help backends. Comments are indicated by ; or # at the beginning
of a line.

Example:

    [megaremote]
    type = mega
    user = you@example.com
    pass = PDPcQVVjVtzFY-GTdDFozqBhTdsPg3qH

Note that passwords are in obscured form. Also, many storage systems
uses token-based authentication instead of passwords, and this requires
additional steps. It is easier, and safer, to use the interactive
command rclone config instead of manually editing the configuration
file.

The configuration file will typically contain login information, and
should therefore have restricted permissions so that only the current
user can read it. Rclone tries to ensure this when it writes the file.
You may also choose to encrypt the file.

When token-based authentication are used, the configuration file must be
writable, because rclone needs to update the tokens inside it.

--contimeout=TIME

Set the connection timeout. This should be in go time format which looks
like 5s for 5 seconds, 10m for 10 minutes, or 3h30m.

The connection timeout is the amount of time rclone will wait for a
connection to go through to a remote object storage system. It is 1m by
default.

--copy-dest=DIR

When using sync, copy or move DIR is checked in addition to the
destination for files. If a file identical to the source is found that
file is server-side copied from DIR to the destination. This is useful
for incremental backup.

The remote in use must support server-side copy and you must use the
same remote as the destination of the sync. The compare directory must
not overlap the destination directory.

See --compare-dest and --backup-dir.

--dedupe-mode MODE

Mode to run dedupe command in. One of interactive, skip, first, newest,
oldest, rename. The default is interactive. See the dedupe command for
more information as to what these options mean.

--disable FEATURE,FEATURE,...

This disables a comma separated list of optional features. For example
to disable server-side move and server-side copy use:

    --disable move,copy

The features can be put in any case.

To see a list of which features can be disabled use:

    --disable help

See the overview features and optional features to get an idea of which
feature does what.

This flag can be useful for debugging and in exceptional circumstances
(e.g. Google Drive limiting the total volume of Server Side Copies to
100 GiB/day).

--disable-http2

This stops rclone from trying to use HTTP/2 if available. This can
sometimes speed up transfers due to a problem in the Go standard
library.

--dscp VALUE

Specify a DSCP value or name to use in connections. This could help QoS
system to identify traffic class. BE, EF, DF, LE, CSx and AFxx are
allowed.

See the description of differentiated services to get an idea of this
field. Setting this to 1 (LE) to identify the flow to SCAVENGER class
can avoid occupying too much bandwidth in a network with DiffServ
support (RFC 8622).

For example, if you configured QoS on router to handle LE properly.
Running:

    rclone copy --dscp LE from:/from to:/to

would make the priority lower than usual internet flows.

This option has no effect on Windows (see golang/go#42728).

-n, --dry-run

Do a trial run with no permanent changes. Use this to see what rclone
would do without actually doing it. Useful when setting up the sync
command which deletes files in the destination.

--expect-continue-timeout=TIME

This specifies the amount of time to wait for a server's first response
headers after fully writing the request headers if the request has an
"Expect: 100-continue" header. Not all backends support using this.

Zero means no timeout and causes the body to be sent immediately,
without waiting for the server to approve. This time does not include
the time to send the request header.

The default is 1s. Set to 0 to disable.

--error-on-no-transfer

By default, rclone will exit with return code 0 if there were no errors.

This option allows rclone to return exit code 9 if no files were
transferred between the source and destination. This allows using rclone
in scripts, and triggering follow-on actions if data was copied, or
skipping if not.

NB: Enabling this option turns a usually non-fatal error into a
potentially fatal one - please check and adjust your scripts
accordingly!

--fs-cache-expire-duration=TIME

When using rclone via the API rclone caches created remotes for 5
minutes by default in the "fs cache". This means that if you do repeated
actions on the same remote then rclone won't have to build it again from
scratch, which makes it more efficient.

This flag sets the time that the remotes are cached for. If you set it
to 0 (or negative) then rclone won't cache the remotes at all.

Note that if you use some flags, eg --backup-dir and if this is set to 0
rclone may build two remotes (one for the source or destination and one
for the --backup-dir where it may have only built one before.

--fs-cache-expire-interval=TIME

This controls how often rclone checks for cached remotes to expire. See
the --fs-cache-expire-duration documentation above for more info. The
default is 60s, set to 0 to disable expiry.

--header

Add an HTTP header for all transactions. The flag can be repeated to add
multiple headers.

If you want to add headers only for uploads use --header-upload and if
you want to add headers only for downloads use --header-download.

This flag is supported for all HTTP based backends even those not
supported by --header-upload and --header-download so may be used as a
workaround for those with care.

    rclone ls remote:test --header "X-Rclone: Foo" --header "X-LetMeIn: Yes"

--header-download

Add an HTTP header for all download transactions. The flag can be
repeated to add multiple headers.

    rclone sync -i s3:test/src ~/dst --header-download "X-Amz-Meta-Test: Foo" --header-download "X-Amz-Meta-Test2: Bar"

See the GitHub issue here for currently supported backends.

--header-upload

Add an HTTP header for all upload transactions. The flag can be repeated
to add multiple headers.

    rclone sync -i ~/src s3:test/dst --header-upload "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename='cool.html'" --header-upload "X-Amz-Meta-Test: FooBar"

See the GitHub issue here for currently supported backends.

--human-readable

Rclone commands output values for sizes (e.g. number of bytes) and
counts (e.g. number of files) either as raw numbers, or in
human-readable format.

In human-readable format the values are scaled to larger units,
indicated with a suffix shown after the value, and rounded to three
decimals. Rclone consistently uses binary units (powers of 2) for sizes
and decimal units (powers of 10) for counts. The unit prefix for size is
according to IEC standard notation, e.g. Ki for kibi. Used with byte
unit, 1 KiB means 1024 Byte. In list type of output, only the unit
prefix appended to the value (e.g. 9.762Ki), while in more textual
output the full unit is shown (e.g. 9.762 KiB). For counts the SI
standard notation is used, e.g. prefix k for kilo. Used with file
counts, 1k means 1000 files.

The various list commands output raw numbers by default. Option
--human-readable will make them output values in human-readable format
instead (with the short unit prefix).

The about command outputs human-readable by default, with a
command-specific option --full to output the raw numbers instead.

Command size outputs both human-readable and raw numbers in the same
output.

The tree command also considers --human-readable, but it will not use
the exact same notation as the other commands: It rounds to one decimal,
and uses single letter suffix, e.g. K instead of Ki. The reason for this
is that it relies on an external library.

The interactive command ncdu shows human-readable by default, and
responds to key u for toggling human-readable format.

--ignore-case-sync

Using this option will cause rclone to ignore the case of the files when
synchronizing so files will not be copied/synced when the existing
filenames are the same, even if the casing is different.

--ignore-checksum

Normally rclone will check that the checksums of transferred files
match, and give an error "corrupted on transfer" if they don't.

You can use this option to skip that check. You should only use it if
you have had the "corrupted on transfer" error message and you are sure
you might want to transfer potentially corrupted data.

--ignore-existing

Using this option will make rclone unconditionally skip all files that
exist on the destination, no matter the content of these files.

While this isn't a generally recommended option, it can be useful in
cases where your files change due to encryption. However, it cannot
correct partial transfers in case a transfer was interrupted.

When performing a move/moveto command, this flag will leave skipped
files in the source location unchanged when a file with the same name
exists on the destination.

--ignore-size

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal. If you set this flag then rclone will check only the
modification time. If --checksum is set then it only checks the
checksum.

It will also cause rclone to skip verifying the sizes are the same after
transfer.

This can be useful for transferring files to and from OneDrive which
occasionally misreports the size of image files (see #399 for more
info).

-I, --ignore-times

Using this option will cause rclone to unconditionally upload all files
regardless of the state of files on the destination.

Normally rclone would skip any files that have the same modification
time and are the same size (or have the same checksum if using
--checksum).

--immutable

Treat source and destination files as immutable and disallow
modification.

With this option set, files will be created and deleted as requested,
but existing files will never be updated. If an existing file does not
match between the source and destination, rclone will give the error
Source and destination exist but do not match: immutable file modified.

Note that only commands which transfer files (e.g. sync, copy, move) are
affected by this behavior, and only modification is disallowed. Files
may still be deleted explicitly (e.g. delete, purge) or implicitly (e.g.
sync, move). Use copy --immutable if it is desired to avoid deletion as
well as modification.

This can be useful as an additional layer of protection for immutable or
append-only data sets (notably backup archives), where modification
implies corruption and should not be propagated.

-i / --interactive

This flag can be used to tell rclone that you wish a manual confirmation
before destructive operations.

It is recommended that you use this flag while learning rclone
especially with rclone sync.

For example

    $ rclone delete -i /tmp/dir
    rclone: delete "important-file.txt"?
    y) Yes, this is OK (default)
    n) No, skip this
    s) Skip all delete operations with no more questions
    !) Do all delete operations with no more questions
    q) Exit rclone now.
    y/n/s/!/q> n

The options mean

-   y: Yes, this operation should go ahead. You can also press Return
    for this to happen. You'll be asked every time unless you choose s
    or !.
-   n: No, do not do this operation. You'll be asked every time unless
    you choose s or !.
-   s: Skip all the following operations of this type with no more
    questions. This takes effect until rclone exits. If there are any
    different kind of operations you'll be prompted for them.
-   !: Do all the following operations with no more questions. Useful if
    you've decided that you don't mind rclone doing that kind of
    operation. This takes effect until rclone exits . If there are any
    different kind of operations you'll be prompted for them.
-   q: Quit rclone now, just in case!

--leave-root

During rmdirs it will not remove root directory, even if it's empty.

--log-file=FILE

Log all of rclone's output to FILE. This is not active by default. This
can be useful for tracking down problems with syncs in combination with
the -v flag. See the Logging section for more info.

If FILE exists then rclone will append to it.

Note that if you are using the logrotate program to manage rclone's
logs, then you should use the copytruncate option as rclone doesn't have
a signal to rotate logs.

--log-format LIST

Comma separated list of log format options. Accepted options are date,
time, microseconds, pid, longfile, shortfile, UTC. Any other keywords
will be silently ignored. pid will tag log messages with process
identifier which useful with rclone mount --daemon. Other accepted
options are explained in the go documentation. The default log format is
"date,time".

--log-level LEVEL

This sets the log level for rclone. The default log level is NOTICE.

DEBUG is equivalent to -vv. It outputs lots of debug info - useful for
bug reports and really finding out what rclone is doing.

INFO is equivalent to -v. It outputs information about each transfer and
prints stats once a minute by default.

NOTICE is the default log level if no logging flags are supplied. It
outputs very little when things are working normally. It outputs
warnings and significant events.

ERROR is equivalent to -q. It only outputs error messages.

--use-json-log

This switches the log format to JSON for rclone. The fields of json log
are level, msg, source, time.

--low-level-retries NUMBER

This controls the number of low level retries rclone does.

A low level retry is used to retry a failing operation - typically one
HTTP request. This might be uploading a chunk of a big file for example.
You will see low level retries in the log with the -v flag.

This shouldn't need to be changed from the default in normal operations.
However, if you get a lot of low level retries you may wish to reduce
the value so rclone moves on to a high level retry (see the --retries
flag) quicker.

Disable low level retries with --low-level-retries 1.

--max-backlog=N

This is the maximum allowable backlog of files in a sync/copy/move
queued for being checked or transferred.

This can be set arbitrarily large. It will only use memory when the
queue is in use. Note that it will use in the order of N KiB of memory
when the backlog is in use.

Setting this large allows rclone to calculate how many files are pending
more accurately, give a more accurate estimated finish time and make
--order-by work more accurately.

Setting this small will make rclone more synchronous to the listings of
the remote which may be desirable.

Setting this to a negative number will make the backlog as large as
possible.

--max-delete=N

This tells rclone not to delete more than N files. If that limit is
exceeded then a fatal error will be generated and rclone will stop the
operation in progress.

--max-depth=N

This modifies the recursion depth for all the commands except purge.

So if you do rclone --max-depth 1 ls remote:path you will see only the
files in the top level directory. Using --max-depth 2 means you will see
all the files in first two directory levels and so on.

For historical reasons the lsd command defaults to using a --max-depth
of 1 - you can override this with the command line flag.

You can use this command to disable recursion (with --max-depth 1).

Note that if you use this with sync and --delete-excluded the files not
recursed through are considered excluded and will be deleted on the
destination. Test first with --dry-run if you are not sure what will
happen.

--max-duration=TIME

Rclone will stop scheduling new transfers when it has run for the
duration specified.

Defaults to off.

When the limit is reached any existing transfers will complete.

Rclone won't exit with an error if the transfer limit is reached.

--max-transfer=SIZE

Rclone will stop transferring when it has reached the size specified.
Defaults to off.

When the limit is reached all transfers will stop immediately.

Rclone will exit with exit code 8 if the transfer limit is reached.

--cutoff-mode=hard|soft|cautious

This modifies the behavior of --max-transfer Defaults to
--cutoff-mode=hard.

Specifying --cutoff-mode=hard will stop transferring immediately when
Rclone reaches the limit.

Specifying --cutoff-mode=soft will stop starting new transfers when
Rclone reaches the limit.

Specifying --cutoff-mode=cautious will try to prevent Rclone from
reaching the limit.

--modify-window=TIME

When checking whether a file has been modified, this is the maximum
allowed time difference that a file can have and still be considered
equivalent.

The default is 1ns unless this is overridden by a remote. For example OS
X only stores modification times to the nearest second so if you are
reading and writing to an OS X filing system this will be 1s by default.

This command line flag allows you to override that computed default.

--multi-thread-cutoff=SIZE

When downloading files to the local backend above this size, rclone will
use multiple threads to download the file (default 250M).

Rclone preallocates the file (using fallocate(FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE) on
unix or NTSetInformationFile on Windows both of which takes no time)
then each thread writes directly into the file at the correct place.
This means that rclone won't create fragmented or sparse files and there
won't be any assembly time at the end of the transfer.

The number of threads used to download is controlled by
--multi-thread-streams.

Use -vv if you wish to see info about the threads.

This will work with the sync/copy/move commands and friends
copyto/moveto. Multi thread downloads will be used with rclone mount and
rclone serve if --vfs-cache-mode is set to writes or above.

NB that this only works for a local destination but will work with any
source.

NB that multi thread copies are disabled for local to local copies as
they are faster without unless --multi-thread-streams is set explicitly.

NB on Windows using multi-thread downloads will cause the resulting
files to be sparse. Use --local-no-sparse to disable sparse files (which
may cause long delays at the start of downloads) or disable multi-thread
downloads with --multi-thread-streams 0

--multi-thread-streams=N

When using multi thread downloads (see above --multi-thread-cutoff) this
sets the maximum number of streams to use. Set to 0 to disable multi
thread downloads (Default 4).

Exactly how many streams rclone uses for the download depends on the
size of the file. To calculate the number of download streams Rclone
divides the size of the file by the --multi-thread-cutoff and rounds up,
up to the maximum set with --multi-thread-streams.

So if --multi-thread-cutoff 250M and --multi-thread-streams 4 are in
effect (the defaults):

-   0..250 MiB files will be downloaded with 1 stream
-   250..500 MiB files will be downloaded with 2 streams
-   500..750 MiB files will be downloaded with 3 streams
-   750+ MiB files will be downloaded with 4 streams

--no-check-dest

The --no-check-dest can be used with move or copy and it causes rclone
not to check the destination at all when copying files.

This means that:

-   the destination is not listed minimising the API calls
-   files are always transferred
-   this can cause duplicates on remotes which allow it (e.g. Google
    Drive)
-   --retries 1 is recommended otherwise you'll transfer everything
    again on a retry

This flag is useful to minimise the transactions if you know that none
of the files are on the destination.

This is a specialized flag which should be ignored by most users!

--no-gzip-encoding

Don't set Accept-Encoding: gzip. This means that rclone won't ask the
server for compressed files automatically. Useful if you've set the
server to return files with Content-Encoding: gzip but you uploaded
compressed files.

There is no need to set this in normal operation, and doing so will
decrease the network transfer efficiency of rclone.

--no-traverse

The --no-traverse flag controls whether the destination file system is
traversed when using the copy or move commands. --no-traverse is not
compatible with sync and will be ignored if you supply it with sync.

If you are only copying a small number of files (or are filtering most
of the files) and/or have a large number of files on the destination
then --no-traverse will stop rclone listing the destination and save
time.

However, if you are copying a large number of files, especially if you
are doing a copy where lots of the files under consideration haven't
changed and won't need copying then you shouldn't use --no-traverse.

See rclone copy for an example of how to use it.

--no-unicode-normalization

Don't normalize unicode characters in filenames during the sync routine.

Sometimes, an operating system will store filenames containing unicode
parts in their decomposed form (particularly macOS). Some cloud storage
systems will then recompose the unicode, resulting in duplicate files if
the data is ever copied back to a local filesystem.

Using this flag will disable that functionality, treating each unicode
character as unique. For example, by default é and é will be normalized
into the same character. With --no-unicode-normalization they will be
treated as unique characters.

--no-update-modtime

When using this flag, rclone won't update modification times of remote
files if they are incorrect as it would normally.

This can be used if the remote is being synced with another tool also
(e.g. the Google Drive client).

--order-by string

The --order-by flag controls the order in which files in the backlog are
processed in rclone sync, rclone copy and rclone move.

The order by string is constructed like this. The first part describes
what aspect is being measured:

-   size - order by the size of the files
-   name - order by the full path of the files
-   modtime - order by the modification date of the files

This can have a modifier appended with a comma:

-   ascending or asc - order so that the smallest (or oldest) is
    processed first
-   descending or desc - order so that the largest (or newest) is
    processed first
-   mixed - order so that the smallest is processed first for some
    threads and the largest for others

If the modifier is mixed then it can have an optional percentage (which
defaults to 50), e.g. size,mixed,25 which means that 25% of the threads
should be taking the smallest items and 75% the largest. The threads
which take the smallest first will always take the smallest first and
likewise the largest first threads. The mixed mode can be useful to
minimise the transfer time when you are transferring a mixture of large
and small files - the large files are guaranteed upload threads and
bandwidth and the small files will be processed continuously.

If no modifier is supplied then the order is ascending.

For example

-   --order-by size,desc - send the largest files first
-   --order-by modtime,ascending - send the oldest files first
-   --order-by name - send the files with alphabetically by path first

If the --order-by flag is not supplied or it is supplied with an empty
string then the default ordering will be used which is as scanned. With
--checkers 1 this is mostly alphabetical, however with the default
--checkers 8 it is somewhat random.

Limitations

The --order-by flag does not do a separate pass over the data. This
means that it may transfer some files out of the order specified if

-   there are no files in the backlog or the source has not been fully
    scanned yet
-   there are more than --max-backlog files in the backlog

Rclone will do its best to transfer the best file it has so in practice
this should not cause a problem. Think of --order-by as being more of a
best efforts flag rather than a perfect ordering.

If you want perfect ordering then you will need to specify --check-first
which will find all the files which need transferring first before
transferring any.

--password-command SpaceSepList

This flag supplies a program which should supply the config password
when run. This is an alternative to rclone prompting for the password or
setting the RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS variable.

The argument to this should be a command with a space separated list of
arguments. If one of the arguments has a space in then enclose it in ",
if you want a literal " in an argument then enclose the argument in "
and double the ". See CSV encoding for more info.

Eg

    --password-command echo hello
    --password-command echo "hello with space"
    --password-command echo "hello with ""quotes"" and space"

See the Configuration Encryption for more info.

See a Windows PowerShell example on the Wiki.

-P, --progress

This flag makes rclone update the stats in a static block in the
terminal providing a realtime overview of the transfer.

Any log messages will scroll above the static block. Log messages will
push the static block down to the bottom of the terminal where it will
stay.

Normally this is updated every 500mS but this period can be overridden
with the --stats flag.

This can be used with the --stats-one-line flag for a simpler display.

Note: On Windows until this bug is fixed all non-ASCII characters will
be replaced with . when --progress is in use.

--progress-terminal-title

This flag, when used with -P/--progress, will print the string ETA: %s
to the terminal title.

-q, --quiet

This flag will limit rclone's output to error messages only.

--refresh-times

The --refresh-times flag can be used to update modification times of
existing files when they are out of sync on backends which don't support
hashes.

This is useful if you uploaded files with the incorrect timestamps and
you now wish to correct them.

This flag is only useful for destinations which don't support hashes
(e.g. crypt).

This can be used any of the sync commands sync, copy or move.

To use this flag you will need to be doing a modification time sync (so
not using --size-only or --checksum). The flag will have no effect when
using --size-only or --checksum.

If this flag is used when rclone comes to upload a file it will check to
see if there is an existing file on the destination. If this file
matches the source with size (and checksum if available) but has a
differing timestamp then instead of re-uploading it, rclone will update
the timestamp on the destination file. If the checksum does not match
rclone will upload the new file. If the checksum is absent (e.g. on a
crypt backend) then rclone will update the timestamp.

Note that some remotes can't set the modification time without
re-uploading the file so this flag is less useful on them.

Normally if you are doing a modification time sync rclone will update
modification times without --refresh-times provided that the remote
supports checksums and the checksums match on the file. However if the
checksums are absent then rclone will upload the file rather than
setting the timestamp as this is the safe behaviour.

--retries int

Retry the entire sync if it fails this many times it fails (default 3).

Some remotes can be unreliable and a few retries help pick up the files
which didn't get transferred because of errors.

Disable retries with --retries 1.

--retries-sleep=TIME

This sets the interval between each retry specified by --retries

The default is 0. Use 0 to disable.

--size-only

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal. If you set this flag then rclone will check only the
size.

This can be useful transferring files from Dropbox which have been
modified by the desktop sync client which doesn't set checksums of
modification times in the same way as rclone.

--stats=TIME

Commands which transfer data (sync, copy, copyto, move, moveto) will
print data transfer stats at regular intervals to show their progress.

This sets the interval.

The default is 1m. Use 0 to disable.

If you set the stats interval then all commands can show stats. This can
be useful when running other commands, check or mount for example.

Stats are logged at INFO level by default which means they won't show at
default log level NOTICE. Use --stats-log-level NOTICE or -v to make
them show. See the Logging section for more info on log levels.

Note that on macOS you can send a SIGINFO (which is normally ctrl-T in
the terminal) to make the stats print immediately.

--stats-file-name-length integer

By default, the --stats output will truncate file names and paths longer
than 40 characters. This is equivalent to providing
--stats-file-name-length 40. Use --stats-file-name-length 0 to disable
any truncation of file names printed by stats.

--stats-log-level string

Log level to show --stats output at. This can be DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE, or
ERROR. The default is INFO. This means at the default level of logging
which is NOTICE the stats won't show - if you want them to then use
--stats-log-level NOTICE. See the Logging section for more info on log
levels.

--stats-one-line

When this is specified, rclone condenses the stats into a single line
showing the most important stats only.

--stats-one-line-date

When this is specified, rclone enables the single-line stats and
prepends the display with a date string. The default is
2006/01/02 15:04:05 -

--stats-one-line-date-format

When this is specified, rclone enables the single-line stats and
prepends the display with a user-supplied date string. The date string
MUST be enclosed in quotes. Follow golang specs for date formatting
syntax.

--stats-unit=bits|bytes

By default, data transfer rates will be printed in bytes per second.

This option allows the data rate to be printed in bits per second.

Data transfer volume will still be reported in bytes.

The rate is reported as a binary unit, not SI unit. So 1 Mbit/s equals
1,048,576 bit/s and not 1,000,000 bit/s.

The default is bytes.

--suffix=SUFFIX

When using sync, copy or move any files which would have been
overwritten or deleted will have the suffix added to them. If there is a
file with the same path (after the suffix has been added), then it will
be overwritten.

The remote in use must support server-side move or copy and you must use
the same remote as the destination of the sync.

This is for use with files to add the suffix in the current directory or
with --backup-dir. See --backup-dir for more info.

For example

    rclone copy -i /path/to/local/file remote:current --suffix .bak

will copy /path/to/local to remote:current, but for any files which
would have been updated or deleted have .bak added.

If using rclone sync with --suffix and without --backup-dir then it is
recommended to put a filter rule in excluding the suffix otherwise the
sync will delete the backup files.

    rclone sync -i /path/to/local/file remote:current --suffix .bak --exclude "*.bak"

--suffix-keep-extension

When using --suffix, setting this causes rclone put the SUFFIX before
the extension of the files that it backs up rather than after.

So let's say we had --suffix -2019-01-01, without the flag file.txt
would be backed up to file.txt-2019-01-01 and with the flag it would be
backed up to file-2019-01-01.txt. This can be helpful to make sure the
suffixed files can still be opened.

--syslog

On capable OSes (not Windows or Plan9) send all log output to syslog.

This can be useful for running rclone in a script or rclone mount.

--syslog-facility string

If using --syslog this sets the syslog facility (e.g. KERN, USER). See
man syslog for a list of possible facilities. The default facility is
DAEMON.

--temp-dir=DIR

Specify the directory rclone will use for temporary files, to override
the default. Make sure the directory exists and have accessible
permissions.

By default the operating system's temp directory will be used: - On Unix
systems, $TMPDIR if non-empty, else /tmp. - On Windows, the first
non-empty value from %TMP%, %TEMP%, %USERPROFILE%, or the Windows
directory.

When overriding the default with this option, the specified path will be
set as value of environment variable TMPDIR on Unix systems and TMP and
TEMP on Windows.

You can use the config paths command to see the current value.

--tpslimit float

Limit transactions per second to this number. Default is 0 which is used
to mean unlimited transactions per second.

A transaction is roughly defined as an API call; its exact meaning will
depend on the backend. For HTTP based backends it is an HTTP
PUT/GET/POST/etc and its response. For FTP/SFTP it is a round trip
transaction over TCP.

For example, to limit rclone to 10 transactions per second use
--tpslimit 10, or to 1 transaction every 2 seconds use --tpslimit 0.5.

Use this when the number of transactions per second from rclone is
causing a problem with the cloud storage provider (e.g. getting you
banned or rate limited).

This can be very useful for rclone mount to control the behaviour of
applications using it.

This limit applies to all HTTP based backends and to the FTP and SFTP
backends. It does not apply to the local backend or the Storj backend.

See also --tpslimit-burst.

--tpslimit-burst int

Max burst of transactions for --tpslimit (default 1).

Normally --tpslimit will do exactly the number of transaction per second
specified. However if you supply --tps-burst then rclone can save up
some transactions from when it was idle giving a burst of up to the
parameter supplied.

For example if you provide --tpslimit-burst 10 then if rclone has been
idle for more than 10*--tpslimit then it can do 10 transactions very
quickly before they are limited again.

This may be used to increase performance of --tpslimit without changing
the long term average number of transactions per second.

--track-renames

By default, rclone doesn't keep track of renamed files, so if you rename
a file locally then sync it to a remote, rclone will delete the old file
on the remote and upload a new copy.

If you use this flag, and the remote supports server-side copy or
server-side move, and the source and destination have a compatible hash,
then this will track renames during sync operations and perform renaming
server-side.

Files will be matched by size and hash - if both match then a rename
will be considered.

If the destination does not support server-side copy or move, rclone
will fall back to the default behaviour and log an error level message
to the console.

Encrypted destinations are not currently supported by --track-renames if
--track-renames-strategy includes hash.

Note that --track-renames is incompatible with --no-traverse and that it
uses extra memory to keep track of all the rename candidates.

Note also that --track-renames is incompatible with --delete-before and
will select --delete-after instead of --delete-during.

--track-renames-strategy (hash,modtime,leaf,size)

This option changes the matching criteria for --track-renames.

The matching is controlled by a comma separated selection of these
tokens:

-   modtime - the modification time of the file - not supported on all
    backends
-   hash - the hash of the file contents - not supported on all backends
-   leaf - the name of the file not including its directory name
-   size - the size of the file (this is always enabled)

So using --track-renames-strategy modtime,leaf would match files based
on modification time, the leaf of the file name and the size only.

Using --track-renames-strategy modtime or leaf can enable
--track-renames support for encrypted destinations.

If nothing is specified, the default option is matching by hashes.

Note that the hash strategy is not supported with encrypted
destinations.

--delete-(before,during,after)

This option allows you to specify when files on your destination are
deleted when you sync folders.

Specifying the value --delete-before will delete all files present on
the destination, but not on the source before starting the transfer of
any new or updated files. This uses two passes through the file systems,
one for the deletions and one for the copies.

Specifying --delete-during will delete files while checking and
uploading files. This is the fastest option and uses the least memory.

Specifying --delete-after (the default value) will delay deletion of
files until all new/updated files have been successfully transferred.
The files to be deleted are collected in the copy pass then deleted
after the copy pass has completed successfully. The files to be deleted
are held in memory so this mode may use more memory. This is the safest
mode as it will only delete files if there have been no errors
subsequent to that. If there have been errors before the deletions start
then you will get the message
not deleting files as there were IO errors.

--fast-list

When doing anything which involves a directory listing (e.g. sync, copy,
ls - in fact nearly every command), rclone normally lists a directory
and processes it before using more directory lists to process any
subdirectories. This can be parallelised and works very quickly using
the least amount of memory.

However, some remotes have a way of listing all files beneath a
directory in one (or a small number) of transactions. These tend to be
the bucket-based remotes (e.g. S3, B2, GCS, Swift, Hubic).

If you use the --fast-list flag then rclone will use this method for
listing directories. This will have the following consequences for the
listing:

-   It will use fewer transactions (important if you pay for them)
-   It will use more memory. Rclone has to load the whole listing into
    memory.
-   It may be faster because it uses fewer transactions
-   It may be slower because it can't be parallelized

rclone should always give identical results with and without
--fast-list.

If you pay for transactions and can fit your entire sync listing into
memory then --fast-list is recommended. If you have a very big sync to
do then don't use --fast-list otherwise you will run out of memory.

If you use --fast-list on a remote which doesn't support it, then rclone
will just ignore it.

--timeout=TIME

This sets the IO idle timeout. If a transfer has started but then
becomes idle for this long it is considered broken and disconnected.

The default is 5m. Set to 0 to disable.

--transfers=N

The number of file transfers to run in parallel. It can sometimes be
useful to set this to a smaller number if the remote is giving a lot of
timeouts or bigger if you have lots of bandwidth and a fast remote.

The default is to run 4 file transfers in parallel.

-u, --update

This forces rclone to skip any files which exist on the destination and
have a modified time that is newer than the source file.

This can be useful in avoiding needless transfers when transferring to a
remote which doesn't support modification times directly (or when using
--use-server-modtime to avoid extra API calls) as it is more accurate
than a --size-only check and faster than using --checksum. On such
remotes (or when using --use-server-modtime) the time checked will be
the uploaded time.

If an existing destination file has a modification time older than the
source file's, it will be updated if the sizes are different. If the
sizes are the same, it will be updated if the checksum is different or
not available.

If an existing destination file has a modification time equal (within
the computed modify window) to the source file's, it will be updated if
the sizes are different. The checksum will not be checked in this case
unless the --checksum flag is provided.

In all other cases the file will not be updated.

Consider using the --modify-window flag to compensate for time skews
between the source and the backend, for backends that do not support mod
times, and instead use uploaded times. However, if the backend does not
support checksums, note that sync'ing or copying within the time skew
window may still result in additional transfers for safety.

--use-mmap

If this flag is set then rclone will use anonymous memory allocated by
mmap on Unix based platforms and VirtualAlloc on Windows for its
transfer buffers (size controlled by --buffer-size). Memory allocated
like this does not go on the Go heap and can be returned to the OS
immediately when it is finished with.

If this flag is not set then rclone will allocate and free the buffers
using the Go memory allocator which may use more memory as memory pages
are returned less aggressively to the OS.

It is possible this does not work well on all platforms so it is
disabled by default; in the future it may be enabled by default.

--use-server-modtime

Some object-store backends (e.g, Swift, S3) do not preserve file
modification times (modtime). On these backends, rclone stores the
original modtime as additional metadata on the object. By default it
will make an API call to retrieve the metadata when the modtime is
needed by an operation.

Use this flag to disable the extra API call and rely instead on the
server's modified time. In cases such as a local to remote sync using
--update, knowing the local file is newer than the time it was last
uploaded to the remote is sufficient. In those cases, this flag can
speed up the process and reduce the number of API calls necessary.

Using this flag on a sync operation without also using --update would
cause all files modified at any time other than the last upload time to
be uploaded again, which is probably not what you want.

-v, -vv, --verbose

With -v rclone will tell you about each file that is transferred and a
small number of significant events.

With -vv rclone will become very verbose telling you about every file it
considers and transfers. Please send bug reports with a log with this
setting.

-V, --version

Prints the version number

SSL/TLS options

The outgoing SSL/TLS connections rclone makes can be controlled with
these options. For example this can be very useful with the HTTP or
WebDAV backends. Rclone HTTP servers have their own set of configuration
for SSL/TLS which you can find in their documentation.

--ca-cert string

This loads the PEM encoded certificate authority certificate and uses it
to verify the certificates of the servers rclone connects to.

If you have generated certificates signed with a local CA then you will
need this flag to connect to servers using those certificates.

--client-cert string

This loads the PEM encoded client side certificate.

This is used for mutual TLS authentication.

The --client-key flag is required too when using this.

--client-key string

This loads the PEM encoded client side private key used for mutual TLS
authentication. Used in conjunction with --client-cert.

--no-check-certificate=true/false

--no-check-certificate controls whether a client verifies the server's
certificate chain and host name. If --no-check-certificate is true, TLS
accepts any certificate presented by the server and any host name in
that certificate. In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle
attacks.

This option defaults to false.

This should be used only for testing.

Configuration Encryption

Your configuration file contains information for logging in to your
cloud services. This means that you should keep your rclone.conf file in
a secure location.

If you are in an environment where that isn't possible, you can add a
password to your configuration. This means that you will have to supply
the password every time you start rclone.

To add a password to your rclone configuration, execute rclone config.

    >rclone config
    Current remotes:

    e) Edit existing remote
    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/s/q>

Go into s, Set configuration password:

    e/n/d/s/q> s
    Your configuration is not encrypted.
    If you add a password, you will protect your login information to cloud services.
    a) Add Password
    q) Quit to main menu
    a/q> a
    Enter NEW configuration password:
    password:
    Confirm NEW password:
    password:
    Password set
    Your configuration is encrypted.
    c) Change Password
    u) Unencrypt configuration
    q) Quit to main menu
    c/u/q>

Your configuration is now encrypted, and every time you start rclone you
will have to supply the password. See below for details. In the same
menu, you can change the password or completely remove encryption from
your configuration.

There is no way to recover the configuration if you lose your password.

rclone uses nacl secretbox which in turn uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to
encrypt and authenticate your configuration with secret-key
cryptography. The password is SHA-256 hashed, which produces the key for
secretbox. The hashed password is not stored.

While this provides very good security, we do not recommend storing your
encrypted rclone configuration in public if it contains sensitive
information, maybe except if you use a very strong password.

If it is safe in your environment, you can set the RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
environment variable to contain your password, in which case it will be
used for decrypting the configuration.

You can set this for a session from a script. For unix like systems save
this to a file called set-rclone-password:

    #!/bin/echo Source this file don't run it

    read -s RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
    export RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS

Then source the file when you want to use it. From the shell you would
do source set-rclone-password. It will then ask you for the password and
set it in the environment variable.

An alternate means of supplying the password is to provide a script
which will retrieve the password and print on standard output. This
script should have a fully specified path name and not rely on any
environment variables. The script is supplied either via
--password-command="..." command line argument or via the
RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND environment variable.

One useful example of this is using the passwordstore application to
retrieve the password:

    export RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND="pass rclone/config"

If the passwordstore password manager holds the password for the rclone
configuration, using the script method means the password is primarily
protected by the passwordstore system, and is never embedded in the
clear in scripts, nor available for examination using the standard
commands available. It is quite possible with long running rclone
sessions for copies of passwords to be innocently captured in log files
or terminal scroll buffers, etc. Using the script method of supplying
the password enhances the security of the config password considerably.

If you are running rclone inside a script, unless you are using the
--password-command method, you might want to disable password prompts.
To do that, pass the parameter --ask-password=false to rclone. This will
make rclone fail instead of asking for a password if RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
doesn't contain a valid password, and --password-command has not been
supplied.

Whenever running commands that may be affected by options in a
configuration file, rclone will look for an existing file according to
the rules described above, and load any it finds. If an encrypted file
is found, this includes decrypting it, with the possible consequence of
a password prompt. When executing a command line that you know are not
actually using anything from such a configuration file, you can avoid it
being loaded by overriding the location, e.g. with one of the documented
special values for memory-only configuration. Since only backend options
can be stored in configuration files, this is normally unnecessary for
commands that do not operate on backends, e.g. genautocomplete. However,
it will be relevant for commands that do operate on backends in general,
but are used without referencing a stored remote, e.g. listing local
filesystem paths, or connection strings: rclone --config="" ls .

Developer options

These options are useful when developing or debugging rclone. There are
also some more remote specific options which aren't documented here
which are used for testing. These start with remote name e.g.
--drive-test-option - see the docs for the remote in question.

--cpuprofile=FILE

Write CPU profile to file. This can be analysed with go tool pprof.

--dump flag,flag,flag

The --dump flag takes a comma separated list of flags to dump info
about.

Note that some headers including Accept-Encoding as shown may not be
correct in the request and the response may not show Content-Encoding if
the go standard libraries auto gzip encoding was in effect. In this case
the body of the request will be gunzipped before showing it.

The available flags are:

--dump headers

Dump HTTP headers with Authorization: lines removed. May still contain
sensitive info. Can be very verbose. Useful for debugging only.

Use --dump auth if you do want the Authorization: headers.

--dump bodies

Dump HTTP headers and bodies - may contain sensitive info. Can be very
verbose. Useful for debugging only.

Note that the bodies are buffered in memory so don't use this for
enormous files.

--dump requests

Like --dump bodies but dumps the request bodies and the response
headers. Useful for debugging download problems.

--dump responses

Like --dump bodies but dumps the response bodies and the request
headers. Useful for debugging upload problems.

--dump auth

Dump HTTP headers - will contain sensitive info such as Authorization:
headers - use --dump headers to dump without Authorization: headers. Can
be very verbose. Useful for debugging only.

--dump filters

Dump the filters to the output. Useful to see exactly what include and
exclude options are filtering on.

--dump goroutines

This dumps a list of the running go-routines at the end of the command
to standard output.

--dump openfiles

This dumps a list of the open files at the end of the command. It uses
the lsof command to do that so you'll need that installed to use it.

--memprofile=FILE

Write memory profile to file. This can be analysed with go tool pprof.

Filtering

For the filtering options

-   --delete-excluded
-   --filter

See the remote control section.

Logging

rclone has 4 levels of logging, ERROR, NOTICE, INFO and DEBUG.

By default, rclone logs to standard error. This means you can redirect
standard error and still see the normal output of rclone commands (e.g.
rclone ls).

By default, rclone will produce Error and Notice level messages.

If you use the -q flag, rclone will only produce Error messages.

If you use the -v flag, rclone will produce Error, Notice and Info
messages.

If you use the -vv flag, rclone will produce Error, Notice, Info and
Debug messages.

You can also control the log levels with the --log-level flag.

If you use the --log-file=FILE option, rclone will redirect Error, Info
and Debug messages along with standard error to FILE.

If you use the --syslog flag then rclone will log to syslog and the
--syslog-facility control which facility it uses.

Rclone prefixes all log messages with their level in capitals, e.g. INFO
which makes it easy to grep the log file for different kinds of
information.

Exit Code

If any errors occur during the command execution, rclone will exit with
a non-zero exit code. This allows scripts to detect when rclone
operations have failed.

During the startup phase, rclone will exit immediately if an error is
detected in the configuration. There will always be a log message
immediately before exiting.

When rclone is running it will accumulate errors as it goes along, and
only exit with a non-zero exit code if (after retries) there were still
failed transfers. For every error counted there will be a high priority
log message (visible with -q) showing the message and which file caused
the problem. A high priority message is also shown when starting a retry
so the user can see that any previous error messages may not be valid
after the retry. If rclone has done a retry it will log a high priority
message if the retry was successful.

Environment Variables

Rclone can be configured entirely using environment variables. These can
be used to set defaults for options or config file entries.

Options

Every option in rclone can have its default set by environment variable.

To find the name of the environment variable, first, take the long
option name, strip the leading --, change - to _, make upper case and
prepend RCLONE_.

For example, to always set --stats 5s, set the environment variable
RCLONE_STATS=5s. If you set stats on the command line this will override
the environment variable setting.

Or to always use the trash in drive --drive-use-trash, set
RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH=true.

The same parser is used for the options and the environment variables so
they take exactly the same form.

The options set by environment variables can be seen with the -vv flag,
e.g. rclone version -vv.

Config file

You can set defaults for values in the config file on an individual
remote basis. The names of the config items are documented in the page
for each backend.

To find the name of the environment variable, you need to set, take
RCLONE_CONFIG_ + name of remote + _ + name of config file option and
make it all uppercase.

For example, to configure an S3 remote named mys3: without a config file
(using unix ways of setting environment variables):

    $ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_TYPE=s3
    $ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
    $ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
    $ rclone lsd mys3:
              -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
    $ rclone listremotes | grep mys3
    mys3:

Note that if you want to create a remote using environment variables you
must create the ..._TYPE variable as above.

Note that the name of a remote created using environment variable is
case insensitive, in contrast to regular remotes stored in config file
as documented above. You must write the name in uppercase in the
environment variable, but as seen from example above it will be listed
and can be accessed in lowercase, while you can also refer to the same
remote in uppercase:

    $ rclone lsd mys3:
              -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
    $ rclone lsd MYS3:
              -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket

Note that you can only set the options of the immediate backend, so
RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3CRYPT_ACCESS_KEY_ID has no effect, if myS3Crypt is a
crypt remote based on an S3 remote. However RCLONE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID will
set the access key of all remotes using S3, including myS3Crypt.

Note also that now rclone has connection strings, it is probably easier
to use those instead which makes the above example

    rclone lsd :s3,access_key_id=XXX,secret_access_key=XXX:

Precedence

The various different methods of backend configuration are read in this
order and the first one with a value is used.

-   Parameters in connection strings, e.g. myRemote,skip_links:
-   Flag values as supplied on the command line, e.g. --skip-links
-   Remote specific environment vars, e.g.
    RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_SKIP_LINKS (see above).
-   Backend-specific environment vars, e.g. RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS.
-   Backend generic environment vars, e.g. RCLONE_SKIP_LINKS.
-   Config file, e.g. skip_links = true.
-   Default values, e.g. false - these can't be changed.

So if both --skip-links is supplied on the command line and an
environment variable RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS is set, the command line
flag will take preference.

The backend configurations set by environment variables can be seen with
the -vv flag, e.g. rclone about myRemote: -vv.

For non backend configuration the order is as follows:

-   Flag values as supplied on the command line, e.g. --stats 5s.
-   Environment vars, e.g. RCLONE_STATS=5s.
-   Default values, e.g. 1m - these can't be changed.

Other environment variables

-   RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS set to contain your config file password (see
    Configuration Encryption section)
-   HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY (or the lowercase versions
    thereof).
    -   HTTPS_PROXY takes precedence over HTTP_PROXY for https requests.
    -   The environment values may be either a complete URL or a
        "host[:port]" for, in which case the "http" scheme is assumed.
-   USER and LOGNAME values are used as fallbacks for current username.
    The primary method for looking up username is OS-specific: Windows
    API on Windows, real user ID in /etc/passwd on Unix systems. In the
    documentation the current username is simply referred to as $USER.
-   RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR - rclone sets this variable for use in config
    files and sub processes to point to the directory holding the config
    file.

The options set by environment variables can be seen with the -vv and
--log-level=DEBUG flags, e.g. rclone version -vv.

Configuring rclone on a remote / headless machine

Some of the configurations (those involving oauth2) require an Internet
connected web browser.

If you are trying to set rclone up on a remote or headless box with no
browser available on it (e.g. a NAS or a server in a datacenter) then
you will need to use an alternative means of configuration. There are
two ways of doing it, described below.

Configuring using rclone authorize

On the headless box run rclone config but answer N to the
Use auto config? question.

    ...
    Remote config
    Use auto config?
     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes (default)
    n) No
    y/n> n
    For this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has
    a web browser available.

    For more help and alternate methods see: https://rclone.org/remote_setup/

    Execute the following on the machine with the web browser (same rclone
    version recommended):

        rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive"

    Then paste the result below:
    result>

Then on your main desktop machine

    rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive"
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    Paste the following into your remote machine --->
    SECRET_TOKEN
    <---End paste

Then back to the headless box, paste in the code

    result> SECRET_TOKEN
    --------------------
    [acd12]
    client_id = 
    client_secret = 
    token = SECRET_TOKEN
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d>

Configuring by copying the config file

Rclone stores all of its config in a single configuration file. This can
easily be copied to configure a remote rclone.

So first configure rclone on your desktop machine with

    rclone config

to set up the config file.

Find the config file by running rclone config file, for example

    $ rclone config file
    Configuration file is stored at:
    /home/user/.rclone.conf

Now transfer it to the remote box (scp, cut paste, ftp, sftp, etc.) and
place it in the correct place (use rclone config file on the remote box
to find out where).

Filtering, includes and excludes

Filter flags determine which files rclone sync, move, ls, lsl, md5sum,
sha1sum, size, delete, check and similar commands apply to.

They are specified in terms of path/file name patterns; path/file lists;
file age and size, or presence of a file in a directory. Bucket based
remotes without the concept of directory apply filters to object key,
age and size in an analogous way.

Rclone purge does not obey filters.

To test filters without risk of damage to data, apply them to rclone ls,
or with the --dry-run and -vv flags.

Rclone filter patterns can only be used in filter command line options,
not in the specification of a remote.

E.g. rclone copy "remote:dir*.jpg" /path/to/dir does not have a filter
effect. rclone copy remote:dir /path/to/dir --include "*.jpg" does.

Important Avoid mixing any two of --include..., --exclude... or
--filter... flags in an rclone command. The results may not be what you
expect. Instead use a --filter... flag.

Patterns for matching path/file names

Pattern syntax

Here is a formal definition of the pattern syntax, examples are below.

Rclone matching rules follow a glob style:

    *         matches any sequence of non-separator (/) characters
    **        matches any sequence of characters including / separators
    ?         matches any single non-separator (/) character
    [ [ ! ] { character-range } ]
              character class (must be non-empty)
    { pattern-list }
              pattern alternatives
    {{ regexp }}
              regular expression to match
    c         matches character c (c != *, **, ?, \, [, {, })
    \c        matches reserved character c (c = *, **, ?, \, [, {, }) or character class

character-range:

    c         matches character c (c != \, -, ])
    \c        matches reserved character c (c = \, -, ])
    lo - hi   matches character c for lo <= c <= hi

pattern-list:

    pattern { , pattern }
              comma-separated (without spaces) patterns

character classes (see Go regular expression reference) include:

    Named character classes (e.g. [\d], [^\d], [\D], [^\D])
    Perl character classes (e.g. \s, \S, \w, \W)
    ASCII character classes (e.g. [[:alnum:]], [[:alpha:]], [[:punct:]], [[:xdigit:]])

regexp for advanced users to insert a regular expression - see below for
more info:

    Any re2 regular expression not containing `}}`

If the filter pattern starts with a / then it only matches at the top
level of the directory tree, relative to the root of the remote (not
necessarily the root of the drive). If it does not start with / then it
is matched starting at the end of the path/file name but it only matches
a complete path element - it must match from a / separator or the
beginning of the path/file.

    file.jpg   - matches "file.jpg"
               - matches "directory/file.jpg"
               - doesn't match "afile.jpg"
               - doesn't match "directory/afile.jpg"
    /file.jpg  - matches "file.jpg" in the root directory of the remote
               - doesn't match "afile.jpg"
               - doesn't match "directory/file.jpg"

The top level of the remote may not be the top level of the drive.

E.g. for a Microsoft Windows local directory structure

    F:
    ├── bkp
    ├── data
    │   ├── excl
    │   │   ├── 123.jpg
    │   │   └── 456.jpg
    │   ├── incl
    │   │   └── document.pdf

To copy the contents of folder data into folder bkp excluding the
contents of subfolder exclthe following command treats F:\data and
F:\bkp as top level for filtering.

rclone copy F:\data\ F:\bkp\ --exclude=/excl/**

Important Use / in path/file name patterns and not \ even if running on
Microsoft Windows.

Simple patterns are case sensitive unless the --ignore-case flag is
used.

Without --ignore-case (default)

    potato - matches "potato"
           - doesn't match "POTATO"

With --ignore-case

    potato - matches "potato"
           - matches "POTATO"

Using regular expressions in filter patterns

The syntax of filter patterns is glob style matching (like bash uses) to
make things easy for users. However this does not provide absolute
control over the matching, so for advanced users rclone also provides a
regular expression syntax.

The regular expressions used are as defined in the Go regular expression
reference. Regular expressions should be enclosed in {{ }}. They will
match only the last path segment if the glob doesn't start with / or the
whole path name if it does.

Here is how the {{regexp}} is transformed into an full regular
expression to match the entire path:

    {{regexp}}  becomes (^|/)(regexp)$
    /{{regexp}} becomes ^(regexp)$

Regexp syntax can be mixed with glob syntax, for example

    *.{{jpe?g}} to match file.jpg, file.jpeg but not file.png

You can also use regexp flags - to set case insensitive, for example

    *.{{(?i)jpg}} to match file.jpg, file.JPG but not file.png

Be careful with wildcards in regular expressions - you don't want them
to match path separators normally. To match any file name starting with
start and ending with end write

    {{start[^/]*end\.jpg}}

Not

    {{start.*end\.jpg}}

Which will match a directory called start with a file called end.jpg in
it as the .* will match / characters.

Note that you can use -vv --dump filters to show the filter patterns in
regexp format - rclone implements the glob patters by transforming them
into regular expressions.

How filter rules are applied to files

Rclone path/file name filters are made up of one or more of the
following flags:

-   --include
-   --include-from
-   --exclude
-   --exclude-from
-   --filter
-   --filter-from

There can be more than one instance of individual flags.

Rclone internally uses a combined list of all the include and exclude
rules. The order in which rules are processed can influence the result
of the filter.

All flags of the same type are processed together in the order above,
regardless of what order the different types of flags are included on
the command line.

Multiple instances of the same flag are processed from left to right
according to their position in the command line.

To mix up the order of processing includes and excludes use --filter...
flags.

Within --include-from, --exclude-from and --filter-from flags rules are
processed from top to bottom of the referenced file.

If there is an --include or --include-from flag specified, rclone
implies a - ** rule which it adds to the bottom of the internal rule
list. Specifying a + rule with a --filter... flag does not imply that
rule.

Each path/file name passed through rclone is matched against the
combined filter list. At first match to a rule the path/file name is
included or excluded and no further filter rules are processed for that
path/file.

If rclone does not find a match, after testing against all rules
(including the implied rule if appropriate), the path/file name is
included.

Any path/file included at that stage is processed by the rclone command.

--files-from and --files-from-raw flags over-ride and cannot be combined
with other filter options.

To see the internal combined rule list, in regular expression form, for
a command add the --dump filters flag. Running an rclone command with
--dump filters and -vv flags lists the internal filter elements and
shows how they are applied to each source path/file. There is not
currently a means provided to pass regular expression filter options
into rclone directly though character class filter rules contain
character classes. Go regular expression reference

How filter rules are applied to directories

Rclone commands are applied to path/file names not directories. The
entire contents of a directory can be matched to a filter by the pattern
directory/* or recursively by directory/**.

Directory filter rules are defined with a closing / separator.

E.g. /directory/subdirectory/ is an rclone directory filter rule.

Rclone commands can use directory filter rules to determine whether they
recurse into subdirectories. This potentially optimises access to a
remote by avoiding listing unnecessary directories. Whether optimisation
is desirable depends on the specific filter rules and source remote
content.

Directory recursion optimisation occurs if either:

-   A source remote does not support the rclone ListR primitive. local,
    sftp, Microsoft OneDrive and WebDav do not support ListR. Google
    Drive and most bucket type storage do. Full list

-   On other remotes (those that support ListR), if the rclone command
    is not naturally recursive, and provided it is not run with the
    --fast-list flag. ls, lsf -R and size are naturally recursive but
    sync, copy and move are not.

-   Whenever the --disable ListR flag is applied to an rclone command.

Rclone commands imply directory filter rules from path/file filter
rules. To view the directory filter rules rclone has implied for a
command specify the --dump filters flag.

E.g. for an include rule

    /a/*.jpg

Rclone implies the directory include rule

    /a/

Directory filter rules specified in an rclone command can limit the
scope of an rclone command but path/file filters still have to be
specified.

E.g. rclone ls remote: --include /directory/ will not match any files.
Because it is an --include option the --exclude ** rule is implied, and
the /directory/ pattern serves only to optimise access to the remote by
ignoring everything outside of that directory.

E.g. rclone ls remote: --filter-from filter-list.txt with a file
filter-list.txt:

    - /dir1/
    - /dir2/
    + *.pdf
    - **

All files in directories dir1 or dir2 or their subdirectories are
completely excluded from the listing. Only files of suffix pdf in the
root of remote: or its subdirectories are listed. The - ** rule prevents
listing of any path/files not previously matched by the rules above.

Option exclude-if-present creates a directory exclude rule based on the
presence of a file in a directory and takes precedence over other rclone
directory filter rules.

When using pattern list syntax, if a pattern item contains either / or
**, then rclone will not able to imply a directory filter rule from this
pattern list.

E.g. for an include rule

    {dir1/**,dir2/**}

Rclone will match files below directories dir1 or dir2 only, but will
not be able to use this filter to exclude a directory dir3 from being
traversed.

Directory recursion optimisation may affect performance, but normally
not the result. One exception to this is sync operations with option
--create-empty-src-dirs, where any traversed empty directories will be
created. With the pattern list example {dir1/**,dir2/**} above, this
would create an empty directory dir3 on destination (when it exists on
source). Changing the filter to {dir1,dir2}/**, or splitting it into two
include rules --include dir1/** --include dir2/**, will match the same
files while also filtering directories, with the result that an empty
directory dir3 will no longer be created.

--exclude - Exclude files matching pattern

Excludes path/file names from an rclone command based on a single
exclude rule.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

--exclude should not be used with --include, --include-from, --filter or
--filter-from flags.

--exclude has no effect when combined with --files-from or
--files-from-raw flags.

E.g. rclone ls remote: --exclude *.bak excludes all .bak files from
listing.

E.g. rclone size remote: "--exclude /dir/**" returns the total size of
all files on remote: excluding those in root directory dir and sub
directories.

E.g. on Microsoft Windows rclone ls remote: --exclude "*\[{JP,KR,HK}\]*"
lists the files in remote: with [JP] or [KR] or [HK] in their name.
Quotes prevent the shell from interpreting the \ characters.\ characters
escape the [ and ] so an rclone filter treats them literally rather than
as a character-range. The { and } define an rclone pattern list. For
other operating systems single quotes are required ie
rclone ls remote: --exclude '*\[{JP,KR,HK}\]*'

--exclude-from - Read exclude patterns from file

Excludes path/file names from an rclone command based on rules in a
named file. The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules.

For an example exclude-file.txt:

    # a sample exclude rule file
    *.bak
    file2.jpg

rclone ls remote: --exclude-from exclude-file.txt lists the files on
remote: except those named file2.jpg or with a suffix .bak. That is
equivalent to rclone ls remote: --exclude file2.jpg --exclude "*.bak".

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

The --exclude-from flag is useful where multiple exclude filter rules
are applied to an rclone command.

--exclude-from should not be used with --include, --include-from,
--filter or --filter-from flags.

--exclude-from has no effect when combined with --files-from or
--files-from-raw flags.

--exclude-from followed by - reads filter rules from standard input.

--include - Include files matching pattern

Adds a single include rule based on path/file names to an rclone
command.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

--include has no effect when combined with --files-from or
--files-from-raw flags.

--include implies --exclude ** at the end of an rclone internal filter
list. Therefore if you mix --include and --include-from flags with
--exclude, --exclude-from, --filter or --filter-from, you must use
include rules for all the files you want in the include statement. For
more flexibility use the --filter-from flag.

E.g. rclone ls remote: --include "*.{png,jpg}" lists the files on
remote: with suffix .png and .jpg. All other files are excluded.

E.g. multiple rclone copy commands can be combined with --include and a
pattern-list.

    rclone copy /vol1/A remote:A
    rclone copy /vol1/B remote:B

is equivalent to:

    rclone copy /vol1 remote: --include "{A,B}/**"

E.g. rclone ls remote:/wheat --include "??[^[:punct:]]*" lists the files
remote: directory wheat (and subdirectories) whose third character is
not punctuation. This example uses an ASCII character class.

--include-from - Read include patterns from file

Adds path/file names to an rclone command based on rules in a named
file. The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules.

For an example include-file.txt:

    # a sample include rule file
    *.jpg
    file2.avi

rclone ls remote: --include-from include-file.txt lists the files on
remote: with name file2.avi or suffix .jpg. That is equivalent to
rclone ls remote: --include file2.avi --include "*.jpg".

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

The --include-from flag is useful where multiple include filter rules
are applied to an rclone command.

--include-from implies --exclude ** at the end of an rclone internal
filter list. Therefore if you mix --include and --include-from flags
with --exclude, --exclude-from, --filter or --filter-from, you must use
include rules for all the files you want in the include statement. For
more flexibility use the --filter-from flag.

--exclude-from has no effect when combined with --files-from or
--files-from-raw flags.

--exclude-from followed by - reads filter rules from standard input.

--filter - Add a file-filtering rule

Specifies path/file names to an rclone command, based on a single
include or exclude rule, in + or - format.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

--filter + differs from --include. In the case of --include rclone
implies an --exclude * rule which it adds to the bottom of the internal
rule list. --filter...+ does not imply that rule.

--filter has no effect when combined with --files-from or
--files-from-raw flags.

--filter should not be used with --include, --include-from, --exclude or
--exclude-from flags.

E.g. rclone ls remote: --filter "- *.bak" excludes all .bak files from a
list of remote:.

--filter-from - Read filtering patterns from a file

Adds path/file names to an rclone command based on rules in a named
file. The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules. Include
rules start with + and exclude rules with -. ! clears existing rules.
Rules are processed in the order they are defined.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

Arrange the order of filter rules with the most restrictive first and
work down.

E.g. for filter-file.txt:

    # a sample filter rule file
    - secret*.jpg
    + *.jpg
    + *.png
    + file2.avi
    - /dir/Trash/**
    + /dir/**
    # exclude everything else
    - *

rclone ls remote: --filter-from filter-file.txt lists the path/files on
remote: including all jpg and png files, excluding any matching
secret*.jpg and including file2.avi. It also includes everything in the
directory dir at the root of remote, except remote:dir/Trash which it
excludes. Everything else is excluded.

E.g. for an alternative filter-file.txt:

    - secret*.jpg
    + *.jpg
    + *.png
    + file2.avi
    - *

Files file1.jpg, file3.png and file2.avi are listed whilst secret17.jpg
and files without the suffix .jpgor.png` are excluded.

E.g. for an alternative filter-file.txt:

    + *.jpg
    + *.gif
    !
    + 42.doc
    - *

Only file 42.doc is listed. Prior rules are cleared by the !.

--files-from - Read list of source-file names

Adds path/files to an rclone command from a list in a named file. Rclone
processes the path/file names in the order of the list, and no others.

Other filter flags (--include, --include-from, --exclude,
--exclude-from, --filter and --filter-from) are ignored when
--files-from is used.

--files-from expects a list of files as its input. Leading or trailing
whitespace is stripped from the input lines. Lines starting with # or ;
are ignored.

Rclone commands with a --files-from flag traverse the remote, treating
the names in --files-from as a set of filters.

If the --no-traverse and --files-from flags are used together an rclone
command does not traverse the remote. Instead it addresses each
path/file named in the file individually. For each path/file name, that
requires typically 1 API call. This can be efficient for a short
--files-from list and a remote containing many files.

Rclone commands do not error if any names in the --files-from file are
missing from the source remote.

The --files-from flag can be repeated in a single rclone command to read
path/file names from more than one file. The files are read from left to
right along the command line.

Paths within the --files-from file are interpreted as starting with the
root specified in the rclone command. Leading / separators are ignored.
See --files-from-raw if you need the input to be processed in a raw
manner.

E.g. for a file files-from.txt:

    # comment
    file1.jpg
    subdir/file2.jpg

rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt /home/me/pics remote:pics copies
the following, if they exist, and only those files.

    /home/me/pics/file1.jpg        → remote:pics/file1.jpg
    /home/me/pics/subdir/file2.jpg → remote:pics/subdir/file2.jpg

E.g. to copy the following files referenced by their absolute paths:

    /home/user1/42
    /home/user1/dir/ford
    /home/user2/prefect

First find a common subdirectory - in this case /home and put the
remaining files in files-from.txt with or without leading /, e.g.

    user1/42
    user1/dir/ford
    user2/prefect

Then copy these to a remote:

    rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt /home remote:backup

The three files are transferred as follows:

    /home/user1/42       → remote:backup/user1/important
    /home/user1/dir/ford → remote:backup/user1/dir/file
    /home/user2/prefect  → remote:backup/user2/stuff

Alternatively if / is chosen as root files-from.txt will be:

    /home/user1/42
    /home/user1/dir/ford
    /home/user2/prefect

The copy command will be:

    rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt / remote:backup

Then there will be an extra home directory on the remote:

    /home/user1/42       → remote:backup/home/user1/42
    /home/user1/dir/ford → remote:backup/home/user1/dir/ford
    /home/user2/prefect  → remote:backup/home/user2/prefect

--files-from-raw - Read list of source-file names without any processing

This flag is the same as --files-from except that input is read in a raw
manner. Lines with leading / trailing whitespace, and lines starting
with ; or # are read without any processing. rclone lsf has a compatible
format that can be used to export file lists from remotes for input to
--files-from-raw.

--ignore-case - make searches case insensitive

By default, rclone filter patterns are case sensitive. The --ignore-case
flag makes all of the filters patterns on the command line case
insensitive.

E.g. --include "zaphod.txt" does not match a file Zaphod.txt. With
--ignore-case a match is made.

Quoting shell metacharacters

Rclone commands with filter patterns containing shell metacharacters may
not as work as expected in your shell and may require quoting.

E.g. linux, OSX (* metacharacter)

-   --include \*.jpg
-   --include '*.jpg'
-   --include='*.jpg'

Microsoft Windows expansion is done by the command, not shell, so
--include *.jpg does not require quoting.

If the rclone error
Command .... needs .... arguments maximum: you provided .... non flag arguments:
is encountered, the cause is commonly spaces within the name of a remote
or flag value. The fix then is to quote values containing spaces.

Other filters

--min-size - Don't transfer any file smaller than this

Controls the minimum size file within the scope of an rclone command.
Default units are KiB but abbreviations K, M, G, T or P are valid.

E.g. rclone ls remote: --min-size 50k lists files on remote: of 50 KiB
size or larger.

--max-size - Don't transfer any file larger than this

Controls the maximum size file within the scope of an rclone command.
Default units are KiB but abbreviations K, M, G, T or P are valid.

E.g. rclone ls remote: --max-size 1G lists files on remote: of 1 GiB
size or smaller.

--max-age - Don't transfer any file older than this

Controls the maximum age of files within the scope of an rclone command.
Default units are seconds or the following abbreviations are valid:

-   ms - Milliseconds
-   s - Seconds
-   m - Minutes
-   h - Hours
-   d - Days
-   w - Weeks
-   M - Months
-   y - Years

--max-age can also be specified as an absolute time in the following
formats:

-   RFC3339 - e.g. 2006-01-02T15:04:05Z or 2006-01-02T15:04:05+07:00
-   ISO8601 Date and time, local timezone - 2006-01-02T15:04:05
-   ISO8601 Date and time, local timezone - 2006-01-02 15:04:05
-   ISO8601 Date - 2006-01-02 (YYYY-MM-DD)

--max-age applies only to files and not to directories.

E.g. rclone ls remote: --max-age 2d lists files on remote: of 2 days old
or less.

--min-age - Don't transfer any file younger than this

Controls the minimum age of files within the scope of an rclone command.
(see --max-age for valid formats)

--min-age applies only to files and not to directories.

E.g. rclone ls remote: --min-age 2d lists files on remote: of 2 days old
or more.

Other flags

--delete-excluded - Delete files on dest excluded from sync

Important this flag is dangerous to your data - use with --dry-run and
-v first.

In conjunction with rclone sync, --delete-excluded deletes any files on
the destination which are excluded from the command.

E.g. the scope of rclone sync -i A: B: can be restricted:

    rclone --min-size 50k --delete-excluded sync A: B:

All files on B: which are less than 50 KiB are deleted because they are
excluded from the rclone sync command.

--dump filters - dump the filters to the output

Dumps the defined filters to standard output in regular expression
format.

Useful for debugging.

Exclude directory based on a file

The --exclude-if-present flag controls whether a directory is within the
scope of an rclone command based on the presence of a named file within
it.

This flag has a priority over other filter flags.

E.g. for the following directory structure:

    dir1/file1
    dir1/dir2/file2
    dir1/dir2/dir3/file3
    dir1/dir2/dir3/.ignore

The command rclone ls --exclude-if-present .ignore dir1 does not list
dir3, file3 or .ignore.

--exclude-if-present can only be used once in an rclone command.

Common pitfalls

The most frequent filter support issues on the rclone forum are:

-   Not using paths relative to the root of the remote
-   Not using / to match from the root of a remote
-   Not using ** to match the contents of a directory

GUI (Experimental)

Rclone can serve a web based GUI (graphical user interface). This is
somewhat experimental at the moment so things may be subject to change.

Run this command in a terminal and rclone will download and then display
the GUI in a web browser.

    rclone rcd --rc-web-gui

This will produce logs like this and rclone needs to continue to run to
serve the GUI:

    2019/08/25 11:40:14 NOTICE: A new release for gui is present at https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react/releases/download/v0.0.6/currentbuild.zip
    2019/08/25 11:40:14 NOTICE: Downloading webgui binary. Please wait. [Size: 3813937, Path :  /home/USER/.cache/rclone/webgui/v0.0.6.zip]
    2019/08/25 11:40:16 NOTICE: Unzipping
    2019/08/25 11:40:16 NOTICE: Serving remote control on http://127.0.0.1:5572/

This assumes you are running rclone locally on your machine. It is
possible to separate the rclone and the GUI - see below for details.

If you wish to check for updates then you can add --rc-web-gui-update to
the command line.

If you find your GUI broken, you may force it to update by add
--rc-web-gui-force-update.

By default, rclone will open your browser. Add
--rc-web-gui-no-open-browser to disable this feature.

Using the GUI

Once the GUI opens, you will be looking at the dashboard which has an
overall overview.

On the left hand side you will see a series of view buttons you can
click on:

-   Dashboard - main overview
-   Configs - examine and create new configurations
-   Explorer - view, download and upload files to the cloud storage
    systems
-   Backend - view or alter the backend config
-   Log out

(More docs and walkthrough video to come!)

How it works

When you run the rclone rcd --rc-web-gui this is what happens

-   Rclone starts but only runs the remote control API ("rc").
-   The API is bound to localhost with an auto-generated username and
    password.
-   If the API bundle is missing then rclone will download it.
-   rclone will start serving the files from the API bundle over the
    same port as the API
-   rclone will open the browser with a login_token so it can log
    straight in.

Advanced use

The rclone rcd may use any of the flags documented on the rc page.

The flag --rc-web-gui is shorthand for

-   Download the web GUI if necessary
-   Check we are using some authentication
-   --rc-user gui
-   --rc-pass <random password>
-   --rc-serve

These flags can be overridden as desired.

See also the rclone rcd documentation.

Example: Running a public GUI

For example the GUI could be served on a public port over SSL using an
htpasswd file using the following flags:

-   --rc-web-gui
-   --rc-addr :443
-   --rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd
-   --rc-cert /path/to/ssl.crt
-   --rc-key /path/to/ssl.key

Example: Running a GUI behind a proxy

If you want to run the GUI behind a proxy at /rclone you could use these
flags:

-   --rc-web-gui
-   --rc-baseurl rclone
-   --rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd

Or instead of htpasswd if you just want a single user and password:

-   --rc-user me
-   --rc-pass mypassword

Project

The GUI is being developed in the: rclone/rclone-webui-react repository.

Bug reports and contributions are very welcome :-)

If you have questions then please ask them on the rclone forum.

Remote controlling rclone with its API

If rclone is run with the --rc flag then it starts an HTTP server which
can be used to remote control rclone using its API.

You can either use the rclone rc command to access the API or use HTTP
directly.

If you just want to run a remote control then see the rcd command.

Supported parameters

--rc

Flag to start the http server listen on remote requests

--rc-addr=IP

IPaddress:Port or :Port to bind server to. (default "localhost:5572")

--rc-cert=KEY

SSL PEM key (concatenation of certificate and CA certificate)

--rc-client-ca=PATH

Client certificate authority to verify clients with

--rc-htpasswd=PATH

htpasswd file - if not provided no authentication is done

--rc-key=PATH

SSL PEM Private key

--rc-max-header-bytes=VALUE

Maximum size of request header (default 4096)

--rc-user=VALUE

User name for authentication.

--rc-pass=VALUE

Password for authentication.

--rc-realm=VALUE

Realm for authentication (default "rclone")

--rc-server-read-timeout=DURATION

Timeout for server reading data (default 1h0m0s)

--rc-server-write-timeout=DURATION

Timeout for server writing data (default 1h0m0s)

--rc-serve

Enable the serving of remote objects via the HTTP interface. This means
objects will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5572/ by default, so you
can browse to http://127.0.0.1:5572/ or http://127.0.0.1:5572/* to see a
listing of the remotes. Objects may be requested from remotes using this
syntax http://127.0.0.1:5572/[remote:path]/path/to/object

Default Off.

--rc-files /path/to/directory

Path to local files to serve on the HTTP server.

If this is set then rclone will serve the files in that directory. It
will also open the root in the web browser if specified. This is for
implementing browser based GUIs for rclone functions.

If --rc-user or --rc-pass is set then the URL that is opened will have
the authorization in the URL in the http://user:pass@localhost/ style.

Default Off.

--rc-enable-metrics

Enable OpenMetrics/Prometheus compatible endpoint at /metrics.

Default Off.

--rc-web-gui

Set this flag to serve the default web gui on the same port as rclone.

Default Off.

--rc-allow-origin

Set the allowed Access-Control-Allow-Origin for rc requests.

Can be used with --rc-web-gui if the rclone is running on different IP
than the web-gui.

Default is IP address on which rc is running.

--rc-web-fetch-url

Set the URL to fetch the rclone-web-gui files from.

Default
https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone-webui-react/releases/latest.

--rc-web-gui-update

Set this flag to check and update rclone-webui-react from the
rc-web-fetch-url.

Default Off.

--rc-web-gui-force-update

Set this flag to force update rclone-webui-react from the
rc-web-fetch-url.

Default Off.

--rc-web-gui-no-open-browser

Set this flag to disable opening browser automatically when using
web-gui.

Default Off.

--rc-job-expire-duration=DURATION

Expire finished async jobs older than DURATION (default 60s).

--rc-job-expire-interval=DURATION

Interval duration to check for expired async jobs (default 10s).

--rc-no-auth

By default rclone will require authorisation to have been set up on the
rc interface in order to use any methods which access any rclone
remotes. Eg operations/list is denied as it involved creating a remote
as is sync/copy.

If this is set then no authorisation will be required on the server to
use these methods. The alternative is to use --rc-user and --rc-pass and
use these credentials in the request.

Default Off.

Accessing the remote control via the rclone rc command

Rclone itself implements the remote control protocol in its rclone rc
command.

You can use it like this

    $ rclone rc rc/noop param1=one param2=two
    {
        "param1": "one",
        "param2": "two"
    }

Run rclone rc on its own to see the help for the installed remote
control commands.

JSON input

rclone rc also supports a --json flag which can be used to send more
complicated input parameters.

    $ rclone rc --json '{ "p1": [1,"2",null,4], "p2": { "a":1, "b":2 } }' rc/noop
    {
        "p1": [
            1,
            "2",
            null,
            4
        ],
        "p2": {
            "a": 1,
            "b": 2
        }
    }

If the parameter being passed is an object then it can be passed as a
JSON string rather than using the --json flag which simplifies the
command line.

    rclone rc operations/list fs=/tmp remote=test opt='{"showHash": true}'

Rather than

    rclone rc operations/list --json '{"fs": "/tmp", "remote": "test", "opt": {"showHash": true}}'

Special parameters

The rc interface supports some special parameters which apply to all
commands. These start with _ to show they are different.

Running asynchronous jobs with _async = true

Each rc call is classified as a job and it is assigned its own id. By
default jobs are executed immediately as they are created or
synchronously.

If _async has a true value when supplied to an rc call then it will
return immediately with a job id and the task will be run in the
background. The job/status call can be used to get information of the
background job. The job can be queried for up to 1 minute after it has
finished.

It is recommended that potentially long running jobs, e.g. sync/sync,
sync/copy, sync/move, operations/purge are run with the _async flag to
avoid any potential problems with the HTTP request and response timing
out.

Starting a job with the _async flag:

    $ rclone rc --json '{ "p1": [1,"2",null,4], "p2": { "a":1, "b":2 }, "_async": true }' rc/noop
    {
        "jobid": 2
    }

Query the status to see if the job has finished. For more information on
the meaning of these return parameters see the job/status call.

    $ rclone rc --json '{ "jobid":2 }' job/status
    {
        "duration": 0.000124163,
        "endTime": "2018-10-27T11:38:07.911245881+01:00",
        "error": "",
        "finished": true,
        "id": 2,
        "output": {
            "_async": true,
            "p1": [
                1,
                "2",
                null,
                4
            ],
            "p2": {
                "a": 1,
                "b": 2
            }
        },
        "startTime": "2018-10-27T11:38:07.911121728+01:00",
        "success": true
    }

job/list can be used to show the running or recently completed jobs

    $ rclone rc job/list
    {
        "jobids": [
            2
        ]
    }

Setting config flags with _config

If you wish to set config (the equivalent of the global flags) for the
duration of an rc call only then pass in the _config parameter.

This should be in the same format as the config key returned by
options/get.

For example, if you wished to run a sync with the --checksum parameter,
you would pass this parameter in your JSON blob.

    "_config":{"CheckSum": true}

If using rclone rc this could be passed as

    rclone rc operations/sync ... _config='{"CheckSum": true}'

Any config parameters you don't set will inherit the global defaults
which were set with command line flags or environment variables.

Note that it is possible to set some values as strings or integers - see
data types for more info. Here is an example setting the equivalent of
--buffer-size in string or integer format.

    "_config":{"BufferSize": "42M"}
    "_config":{"BufferSize": 44040192}

If you wish to check the _config assignment has worked properly then
calling options/local will show what the value got set to.

Setting filter flags with _filter

If you wish to set filters for the duration of an rc call only then pass
in the _filter parameter.

This should be in the same format as the filter key returned by
options/get.

For example, if you wished to run a sync with these flags

    --max-size 1M --max-age 42s --include "a" --include "b"

you would pass this parameter in your JSON blob.

    "_filter":{"MaxSize":"1M", "IncludeRule":["a","b"], "MaxAge":"42s"}

If using rclone rc this could be passed as

    rclone rc ... _filter='{"MaxSize":"1M", "IncludeRule":["a","b"], "MaxAge":"42s"}'

Any filter parameters you don't set will inherit the global defaults
which were set with command line flags or environment variables.

Note that it is possible to set some values as strings or integers - see
data types for more info. Here is an example setting the equivalent of
--buffer-size in string or integer format.

    "_filter":{"MinSize": "42M"}
    "_filter":{"MinSize": 44040192}

If you wish to check the _filter assignment has worked properly then
calling options/local will show what the value got set to.

Assigning operations to groups with _group = value

Each rc call has its own stats group for tracking its metrics. By
default grouping is done by the composite group name from prefix job/
and id of the job like so job/1.

If _group has a value then stats for that request will be grouped under
that value. This allows caller to group stats under their own name.

Stats for specific group can be accessed by passing group to core/stats:

    $ rclone rc --json '{ "group": "job/1" }' core/stats
    {
        "speed": 12345
        ...
    }

Data types

When the API returns types, these will mostly be straight forward
integer, string or boolean types.

However some of the types returned by the options/get call and taken by
the options/set calls as well as the vfsOpt, mountOpt and the _config
parameters.

-   Duration - these are returned as an integer duration in nanoseconds.
    They may be set as an integer, or they may be set with time string,
    eg "5s". See the options section for more info.
-   Size - these are returned as an integer number of bytes. They may be
    set as an integer or they may be set with a size suffix string, eg
    "10M". See the options section for more info.
-   Enumerated type (such as CutoffMode, DumpFlags, LogLevel,
    VfsCacheMode - these will be returned as an integer and may be set
    as an integer but more conveniently they can be set as a string, eg
    "HARD" for CutoffMode or DEBUG for LogLevel.
-   BandwidthSpec - this will be set and returned as a string, eg "1M".

Specifying remotes to work on

Remotes are specified with the fs=, srcFs=, dstFs= parameters depending
on the command being used.

The parameters can be a string as per the rest of rclone, eg
s3:bucket/path or :sftp:/my/dir. They can also be specified as JSON
blobs.

If specifyng a JSON blob it should be a object mapping strings to
strings. These values will be used to configure the remote. There are 3
special values which may be set:

-   type - set to type to specify a remote called :type:
-   _name - set to name to specify a remote called name:
-   _root - sets the root of the remote - may be empty

One of _name or type should normally be set. If the local backend is
desired then type should be set to local. If _root isn't specified then
it defaults to the root of the remote.

For example this JSON is equivalent to remote:/tmp

    {
        "_name": "remote",
        "_path": "/tmp"
    }

And this is equivalent to :sftp,host='example.com':/tmp

    {
        "type": "sftp",
        "host": "example.com",
        "_path": "/tmp"
    }

And this is equivalent to /tmp/dir

    {
        type = "local",
        _ path = "/tmp/dir"
    }

Supported commands

backend/command: Runs a backend command.

This takes the following parameters:

-   command - a string with the command name
-   fs - a remote name string e.g. "drive:"
-   arg - a list of arguments for the backend command
-   opt - a map of string to string of options

Returns:

-   result - result from the backend command

Example:

    rclone rc backend/command command=noop fs=. -o echo=yes -o blue -a path1 -a path2

Returns

    {
        "result": {
            "arg": [
                "path1",

Authentication is required for this call.

cache/expire: Purge a remote from cache

Purge a remote from the cache backend. Supports either a directory or a
file. Params: - remote = path to remote (required) - withData =
true/false to delete cached data (chunks) as well (optional)

Eg

    rclone rc cache/expire remote=path/to/sub/folder/
    rclone rc cache/expire remote=/ withData=true

cache/fetch: Fetch file chunks

Ensure the specified file chunks are cached on disk.

The chunks= parameter specifies the file chunks to check. It takes a
comma separated list of array slice indices. The slice indices are
similar to Python slices: start[:end]

start is the 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the file to
fetch inclusive. end is 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the
file to fetch exclusive. Both values can be negative, in which case they
count from the back of the file. The value "-5:" represents the last 5
chunks of a file.

Some valid examples are: ":5,-5:" -> the first and last five chunks
"0,-2" -> the first and the second last chunk "0:10" -> the first ten
chunks

Any parameter with a key that starts with "file" can be used to specify
files to fetch, e.g.

    rclone rc cache/fetch chunks=0 file=hello file2=home/goodbye

File names will automatically be encrypted when the a crypt remote is
used on top of the cache.

debug/set-block-profile-rate: Set runtime.SetBlockProfileRate for blocking profiling.

SetBlockProfileRate controls the fraction of goroutine blocking events
that are reported in the blocking profile. The profiler aims to sample
an average of one blocking event per rate nanoseconds spent blocked.

To include every blocking event in the profile, pass rate = 1. To turn
off profiling entirely, pass rate <= 0.

After calling this you can use this to see the blocking profile:

    go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/block

Parameters:

-   rate - int

debug/set-mutex-profile-fraction: Set runtime.SetMutexProfileFraction for mutex profiling.

SetMutexProfileFraction controls the fraction of mutex contention events
that are reported in the mutex profile. On average 1/rate events are
reported. The previous rate is returned.

To turn off profiling entirely, pass rate 0. To just read the current
rate, pass rate < 0. (For n>1 the details of sampling may change.)

Once this is set you can look use this to profile the mutex contention:

    go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/mutex

Parameters:

-   rate - int

Results:

-   previousRate - int

-   leaveRoot - boolean, set to true not to delete the root See the
    rmdirs command command for more information on the above.

Authentication is required for this call.

operations/size: Count the number of bytes and files in remote

This takes the following parameters:

-   fs - a remote name string e.g. "drive:path/to/dir"

Returns:

-   count - number of files
-   bytes - number of bytes in those files

See the size command command for more information on the above.

Authentication is required for this call.

operations/stat: Give information about the supplied file or directory

This takes the following parameters

-   fs - a remote name string eg "drive:"
-   remote - a path within that remote eg "dir"
-   opt - a dictionary of options to control the listing (optional)
    -   see operations/list for the options

The result is

-   item - an object as described in the lsjson command. Will be null if
    not found.

Note that if you are only interested in files then it is much more
efficient to set the filesOnly flag in the options.

See the lsjson command for more information on the above and examples.

Authentication is required for this call.

operations/uploadfile: Upload file using multiform/form-data

This takes the following parameters:

-   fs - a remote name string e.g. "drive:"
-   remote - a path within that remote e.g. "dir"
-   each part in body represents a file to be uploaded See the
    uploadfile command command for more information on the above.

Authentication is required for this call.

options/blocks: List all the option blocks

Returns: - options - a list of the options block names

options/get: Get all the global options

Returns an object where keys are option block names and values are an
object with the current option values in.

Note that these are the global options which are unaffected by use of
the _config and _filter parameters. If you wish to read the parameters
set in _config then use options/config and for _filter use
options/filter.

This shows the internal names of the option within rclone which should
map to the external options very easily with a few exceptions.

options/local: Get the currently active config for this call

Returns an object with the keys "config" and "filter". The "config" key
contains the local config and the "filter" key contains the local
filters.

Note that these are the local options specific to this rc call. If
_config was not supplied then they will be the global options. Likewise
with "_filter".

This call is mostly useful for seeing if _config and _filter passing is
working.

This shows the internal names of the option within rclone which should
map to the external options very easily with a few exceptions.

options/set: Set an option

Parameters:

-   option block name containing an object with
    -   key: value

Repeated as often as required.

Only supply the options you wish to change. If an option is unknown it
will be silently ignored. Not all options will have an effect when
changed like this.

For example:

This sets DEBUG level logs (-vv) (these can be set by number or string)

    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": "DEBUG"}}'
    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": 8}}'

And this sets INFO level logs (-v)

    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": "INFO"}}'

And this sets NOTICE level logs (normal without -v)

    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": "NOTICE"}}'

Authentication is required for this call.

vfs/forget: Forget files or directories in the directory cache.

This forgets the paths in the directory cache causing them to be re-read
from the remote when needed.

If no paths are passed in then it will forget all the paths in the
directory cache.

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Otherwise pass files or dirs in as file=path or dir=path. Any parameter
key starting with file will forget that file and any starting with dir
will forget that dir, e.g.

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=hello file2=goodbye dir=home/junk

This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not supplied
and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be used. If there
is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter must be supplied.

vfs/list: List active VFSes.

This lists the active VFSes.

It returns a list under the key "vfses" where the values are the VFS
names that could be passed to the other VFS commands in the "fs"
parameter.

vfs/poll-interval: Get the status or update the value of the poll-interval option.

Without any parameter given this returns the current status of the
poll-interval setting.

When the interval=duration parameter is set, the poll-interval value is
updated and the polling function is notified. Setting interval=0
disables poll-interval.

    rclone rc vfs/poll-interval interval=5m

The timeout=duration parameter can be used to specify a time to wait for
the current poll function to apply the new value. If timeout is less or
equal 0, which is the default, wait indefinitely.

The new poll-interval value will only be active when the timeout is not
reached.

If poll-interval is updated or disabled temporarily, some changes might
not get picked up by the polling function, depending on the used remote.

This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not supplied
and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be used. If there
is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter must be supplied.

vfs/refresh: Refresh the directory cache.

This reads the directories for the specified paths and freshens the
directory cache.

If no paths are passed in then it will refresh the root directory.

    rclone rc vfs/refresh

Otherwise pass directories in as dir=path. Any parameter key starting
with dir will refresh that directory, e.g.

    rclone rc vfs/refresh dir=home/junk dir2=data/misc

If the parameter recursive=true is given the whole directory tree will
get refreshed. This refresh will use --fast-list if enabled.

This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not supplied
and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be used. If there
is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter must be supplied.

vfs/stats: Stats for a VFS.

This returns stats for the selected VFS.

    {
        // Status of the disk cache - only present if --vfs-cache-mode > off
        "diskCache": {
            "bytesUsed": 0,
            "erroredFiles": 0,
            "files": 0,
            "hashType": 1,
            "outOfSpace": false,
            "path": "/home/user/.cache/rclone/vfs/local/mnt/a",
            "pathMeta": "/home/user/.cache/rclone/vfsMeta/local/mnt/a",
            "uploadsInProgress": 0,
            "uploadsQueued": 0
        },
        "fs": "/mnt/a",
        "inUse": 1,
        // Status of the in memory metadata cache
        "metadataCache": {
            "dirs": 1,
            "files": 0
        },
        // Options as returned by options/get
        "opt": {
            "CacheMaxAge": 3600000000000,
            // ...
            "WriteWait": 1000000000
        }
    }

This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not supplied
and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be used. If there
is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter must be supplied.

Accessing the remote control via HTTP

Rclone implements a simple HTTP based protocol.

Each endpoint takes an JSON object and returns a JSON object or an
error. The JSON objects are essentially a map of string names to values.

All calls must made using POST.

The input objects can be supplied using URL parameters, POST parameters
or by supplying "Content-Type: application/json" and a JSON blob in the
body. There are examples of these below using curl.

The response will be a JSON blob in the body of the response. This is
formatted to be reasonably human-readable.

Error returns

If an error occurs then there will be an HTTP error status (e.g. 500)
and the body of the response will contain a JSON encoded error object,
e.g.

    {
        "error": "Expecting string value for key \"remote\" (was float64)",
        "input": {
            "fs": "/tmp",
            "remote": 3
        },
        "status": 400
        "path": "operations/rmdir",
    }

The keys in the error response are - error - error string - input - the
input parameters to the call - status - the HTTP status code - path -
the path of the call

CORS

The sever implements basic CORS support and allows all origins for that.
The response to a preflight OPTIONS request will echo the requested
"Access-Control-Request-Headers" back.

Using POST with URL parameters only

    curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5572/rc/noop?potato=1&sausage=2'

Response

    {
        "potato": "1",
        "sausage": "2"
    }

Here is what an error response looks like:

    curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5572/rc/error?potato=1&sausage=2'

    {
        "error": "arbitrary error on input map[potato:1 sausage:2]",
        "input": {
            "potato": "1",
            "sausage": "2"
        }
    }

Note that curl doesn't return errors to the shell unless you use the -f
option

    $ curl -f -X POST 'http://localhost:5572/rc/error?potato=1&sausage=2'
    curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 400 Bad Request
    $ echo $?
    22

Using POST with a form

    curl --data "potato=1" --data "sausage=2" http://localhost:5572/rc/noop

Response

    {
        "potato": "1",
        "sausage": "2"
    }

Note that you can combine these with URL parameters too with the POST
parameters taking precedence.

    curl --data "potato=1" --data "sausage=2" "http://localhost:5572/rc/noop?rutabaga=3&sausage=4"

Response

    {
        "potato": "1",
        "rutabaga": "3",
        "sausage": "4"
    }

Using POST with a JSON blob

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"potato":2,"sausage":1}' http://localhost:5572/rc/noop

response

    {
        "password": "xyz",
        "username": "xyz"
    }

This can be combined with URL parameters too if required. The JSON blob
takes precedence.

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"potato":2,"sausage":1}' 'http://localhost:5572/rc/noop?rutabaga=3&potato=4'

    {
        "potato": 2,
        "rutabaga": "3",
        "sausage": 1
    }

Debugging rclone with pprof

If you use the --rc flag this will also enable the use of the go
profiling tools on the same port.

To use these, first install go.

Debugging memory use

To profile rclone's memory use you can run:

    go tool pprof -web http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap

This should open a page in your browser showing what is using what
memory.

You can also use the -text flag to produce a textual summary

    $ go tool pprof -text http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap

Debugging go routine leaks

Memory leaks are most often caused by go routine leaks keeping memory
alive which should have been garbage collected.

See all active go routines using

    curl http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1

Or go to http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1 in your
browser.

Other profiles to look at

You can see a summary of profiles available at
http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/

Here is how to use some of them:

-   Memory: go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap
-   Go routines:
    curl http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1
-   30-second CPU profile:
    go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/profile
-   5-second execution trace:
    wget http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/trace?seconds=5
-   Goroutine blocking profile
    -   Enable first with: rclone rc debug/set-block-profile-rate rate=1
        (docs)
    -   go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/block
-   Contended mutexes:
    -   Enable first with:
        rclone rc debug/set-mutex-profile-fraction rate=1 (docs)
    -   go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/mutex

See the net/http/pprof docs for more info on how to use the profiling
and for a general overview see the Go team's blog post on profiling go
programs.

The profiling hook is zero overhead unless it is used.

Overview of cloud storage systems

Each cloud storage system is slightly different. Rclone attempts to
provide a unified interface to them, but some underlying differences
show through.

Features

Here is an overview of the major features of each cloud storage system.

Notes

¹ Dropbox supports its own custom hash. This is an SHA256 sum of all the
4 MiB block SHA256s.

² SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and md5sum
or sha1sum as well as echo are in the remote's PATH.

³ WebDAV supports hashes when used with Owncloud and Nextcloud only.

⁴ WebDAV supports modtimes when used with Owncloud and Nextcloud only.

⁵ Microsoft OneDrive Personal supports SHA1 hashes, whereas OneDrive for
business and SharePoint server support Microsoft's own QuickXorHash.

⁶ Mail.ru uses its own modified SHA1 hash

⁷ pCloud only supports SHA1 (not MD5) in its EU region

⁸ Opendrive does not support creation of duplicate files using their web
client interface or other stock clients, but the underlying storage
platform has been determined to allow duplicate files, and it is
possible to create them with rclone. It may be that this is a mistake or
an unsupported feature.

Hash

The cloud storage system supports various hash types of the objects. The
hashes are used when transferring data as an integrity check and can be
specifically used with the --checksum flag in syncs and in the check
command.

To use the verify checksums when transferring between cloud storage
systems they must support a common hash type.

ModTime

The cloud storage system supports setting modification times on objects.
If it does then this enables a using the modification times as part of
the sync. If not then only the size will be checked by default, though
the MD5SUM can be checked with the --checksum flag.

All cloud storage systems support some kind of date on the object and
these will be set when transferring from the cloud storage system.

Case Insensitive

If a cloud storage systems is case sensitive then it is possible to have
two files which differ only in case, e.g. file.txt and FILE.txt. If a
cloud storage system is case insensitive then that isn't possible.

This can cause problems when syncing between a case insensitive system
and a case sensitive system. The symptom of this is that no matter how
many times you run the sync it never completes fully.

The local filesystem and SFTP may or may not be case sensitive depending
on OS.

-   Windows - usually case insensitive, though case is preserved
-   OSX - usually case insensitive, though it is possible to format case
    sensitive
-   Linux - usually case sensitive, but there are case insensitive file
    systems (e.g. FAT formatted USB keys)

Most of the time this doesn't cause any problems as people tend to avoid
files whose name differs only by case even on case sensitive systems.

Duplicate files

If a cloud storage system allows duplicate files then it can have two
objects with the same name.

This confuses rclone greatly when syncing - use the rclone dedupe
command to rename or remove duplicates.

Restricted filenames

Some cloud storage systems might have restrictions on the characters
that are usable in file or directory names. When rclone detects such a
name during a file upload, it will transparently replace the restricted
characters with similar looking Unicode characters. To handle the
different sets of restricted characters for different backends, rclone
uses something it calls encoding.

This process is designed to avoid ambiguous file names as much as
possible and allow to move files between many cloud storage systems
transparently.

The name shown by rclone to the user or during log output will only
contain a minimal set of replaced characters to ensure correct
formatting and not necessarily the actual name used on the cloud
storage.

This transformation is reversed when downloading a file or parsing
rclone arguments. For example, when uploading a file named my file?.txt
to Onedrive, it will be displayed as my file?.txt on the console, but
stored as my file？.txt to Onedrive (the ? gets replaced by the similar
looking ？ character, the so-called "fullwidth question mark"). The
reverse transformation allows to read a file unusual/name.txt from
Google Drive, by passing the name unusual／name.txt on the command line
(the / needs to be replaced by the similar looking ／ character).

Caveats

The filename encoding system works well in most cases, at least where
file names are written in English or similar languages. You might not
even notice it: It just works. In some cases it may lead to issues,
though. E.g. when file names are written in Chinese, or Japanese, where
it is always the Unicode fullwidth variants of the punctuation marks
that are used.

On Windows, the characters :, * and ? are examples of restricted
characters. If these are used in filenames on a remote that supports it,
Rclone will transparently convert them to their fullwidth Unicode
variants ＊, ？ and ： when downloading to Windows, and back again when
uploading. This way files with names that are not allowed on Windows can
still be stored.

However, if you have files on your Windows system originally with these
same Unicode characters in their names, they will be included in the
same conversion process. E.g. if you create a file in your Windows
filesystem with name Test：1.jpg, where ： is the Unicode fullwidth
colon symbol, and use rclone to upload it to Google Drive, which
supports regular : (halfwidth question mark), rclone will replace the
fullwidth : with the halfwidth : and store the file as Test:1.jpg in
Google Drive. Since both Windows and Google Drive allows the name
Test：1.jpg, it would probably be better if rclone just kept the name as
is in this case.

With the opposite situation; if you have a file named Test:1.jpg, in
your Google Drive, e.g. uploaded from a Linux system where : is valid in
file names. Then later use rclone to copy this file to your Windows
computer you will notice that on your local disk it gets renamed to
Test：1.jpg. The original filename is not legal on Windows, due to the
:, and rclone therefore renames it to make the copy possible. That is
all good. However, this can also lead to an issue: If you already had a
different file named Test：1.jpg on Windows, and then use rclone to copy
either way. Rclone will then treat the file originally named Test:1.jpg
on Google Drive and the file originally named Test：1.jpg on Windows as
the same file, and replace the contents from one with the other.

Its virtually impossible to handle all cases like these correctly in all
situations, but by customizing the encoding option, changing the set of
characters that rclone should convert, you should be able to create a
configuration that works well for your specific situation. See also the
example below.

(Windows was used as an example of a file system with many restricted
characters, and Google drive a storage system with few.)

Default restricted characters

The table below shows the characters that are replaced by default.

When a replacement character is found in a filename, this character will
be escaped with the ‛ character to avoid ambiguous file names. (e.g. a
file named ␀.txt would shown as ‛␀.txt)

Each cloud storage backend can use a different set of characters, which
will be specified in the documentation for each backend.

The default encoding will also encode these file names as they are
problematic with many cloud storage systems.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes

Some backends only support a sequence of well formed UTF-8 bytes as file
or directory names.

In this case all invalid UTF-8 bytes will be replaced with a quoted
representation of the byte value to allow uploading a file to such a
backend. For example, the invalid byte 0xFE will be encoded as ‛FE.

A common source of invalid UTF-8 bytes are local filesystems, that store
names in a different encoding than UTF-8 or UTF-16, like latin1. See the
local filenames section for details.

Encoding option

Most backends have an encoding option, specified as a flag
--backend-encoding where backend is the name of the backend, or as a
config parameter encoding (you'll need to select the Advanced config in
rclone config to see it).

This will have default value which encodes and decodes characters in
such a way as to preserve the maximum number of characters (see above).

However this can be incorrect in some scenarios, for example if you have
a Windows file system with Unicode fullwidth characters ＊, ？ or ：,
that you want to remain as those characters on the remote rather than
being translated to regular (halfwidth) *, ? and :.

The --backend-encoding flags allow you to change that. You can disable
the encoding completely with --backend-encoding None or set
encoding = None in the config file.

Encoding takes a comma separated list of encodings. You can see the list
of all possible values by passing an invalid value to this flag, e.g.
--local-encoding "help". The command rclone help flags encoding will
show you the defaults for the backends.

Encoding example: FTP

To take a specific example, the FTP backend's default encoding is

    --ftp-encoding "Slash,Del,Ctl,RightSpace,Dot"

However, let's say the FTP server is running on Windows and can't have
any of the invalid Windows characters in file names. You are backing up
Linux servers to this FTP server which do have those characters in file
names. So you would add the Windows set which are

    Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot

to the existing ones, giving:

    Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot,Del,RightSpace

This can be specified using the --ftp-encoding flag or using an encoding
parameter in the config file.

Encoding example: Windows

As a nother example, take a Windows system where there is a file with
name Test：1.jpg, where ： is the Unicode fullwidth colon symbol. When
using rclone to copy this to a remote which supports :, the regular
(halfwidth) colon (such as Google Drive), you will notice that the file
gets renamed to Test:1.jpg.

To avoid this you can change the set of characters rclone should convert
for the local filesystem, using command-line argument --local-encoding.
Rclone's default behavior on Windows corresponds to

    --local-encoding "Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot"

If you want to use fullwidth characters ：, ＊ and ？ in your filenames
without rclone changing them when uploading to a remote, then set the
same as the default value but without Colon,Question,Asterisk:

    --local-encoding "Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot"

Alternatively, you can disable the conversion of any characters with
--local-encoding None.

Instead of using command-line argument --local-encoding, you may also
set it as environment variable RCLONE_LOCAL_ENCODING, or configure a
remote of type local in your config, and set the encoding option there.

The risk by doing this is that if you have a filename with the regular
(halfwidth) :, * and ? in your cloud storage, and you try to download it
to your Windows filesystem, this will fail. These characters are not
valid in filenames on Windows, and you have told rclone not to work
around this by converting them to valid fullwidth variants.

MIME Type

MIME types (also known as media types) classify types of documents using
a simple text classification, e.g. text/html or application/pdf.

Some cloud storage systems support reading (R) the MIME type of objects
and some support writing (W) the MIME type of objects.

The MIME type can be important if you are serving files directly to HTTP
from the storage system.

If you are copying from a remote which supports reading (R) to a remote
which supports writing (W) then rclone will preserve the MIME types.
Otherwise they will be guessed from the extension, or the remote itself
may assign the MIME type.

Optional Features

All rclone remotes support a base command set. Other features depend
upon backend-specific capabilities.

Purge

This deletes a directory quicker than just deleting all the files in the
directory.

† Note Swift, Hubic, and Storj implement this in order to delete
directory markers but they don't actually have a quicker way of deleting
files other than deleting them individually.

‡ StreamUpload is not supported with Nextcloud

Copy

Used when copying an object to and from the same remote. This known as a
server-side copy so you can copy a file without downloading it and
uploading it again. It is used if you use rclone copy or rclone move if
the remote doesn't support Move directly.

If the server doesn't support Copy directly then for copy operations the
file is downloaded then re-uploaded.

Move

Used when moving/renaming an object on the same remote. This is known as
a server-side move of a file. This is used in rclone move if the server
doesn't support DirMove.

If the server isn't capable of Move then rclone simulates it with Copy
then delete. If the server doesn't support Copy then rclone will
download the file and re-upload it.

DirMove

This is used to implement rclone move to move a directory if possible.
If it isn't then it will use Move on each file (which falls back to Copy
then download and upload - see Move section).

CleanUp

This is used for emptying the trash for a remote by rclone cleanup.

If the server can't do CleanUp then rclone cleanup will return an error.

‡‡ Note that while Box implements this it has to delete every file
individually so it will be slower than emptying the trash via the WebUI

ListR

The remote supports a recursive list to list all the contents beneath a
directory quickly. This enables the --fast-list flag to work. See the
rclone docs for more details.

StreamUpload

Some remotes allow files to be uploaded without knowing the file size in
advance. This allows certain operations to work without spooling the
file to local disk first, e.g. rclone rcat.

LinkSharing

Sets the necessary permissions on a file or folder and prints a link
that allows others to access them, even if they don't have an account on
the particular cloud provider.

About

Rclone about prints quota information for a remote. Typical output
includes bytes used, free, quota and in trash.

If a remote lacks about capability rclone about remote:returns an error.

Backends without about capability cannot determine free space for an
rclone mount, or use policy mfs (most free space) as a member of an
rclone union remote.

See rclone about command

EmptyDir

The remote supports empty directories. See Limitations for details. Most
Object/Bucket-based remotes do not support this.

Docker Volume Plugin

Introduction

Docker 1.9 has added support for creating named volumes via command-line
interface and mounting them in containers as a way to share data between
them. Since Docker 1.10 you can create named volumes with Docker Compose
by descriptions in docker-compose.yml files for use by container groups
on a single host. As of Docker 1.12 volumes are supported by Docker
Swarm included with Docker Engine and created from descriptions in swarm
compose v3 files for use with swarm stacks across multiple cluster
nodes.

Docker Volume Plugins augment the default local volume driver included
in Docker with stateful volumes shared across containers and hosts.
Unlike local volumes, your data will not be deleted when such volume is
removed. Plugins can run managed by the docker daemon, as a native
system service (under systemd, sysv or upstart) or as a standalone
executable. Rclone can run as docker volume plugin in all these modes.
It interacts with the local docker daemon via plugin API and handles
mounting of remote file systems into docker containers so it must run on
the same host as the docker daemon or on every Swarm node.

Getting started

In the first example we will use the SFTP rclone volume with Docker
engine on a standalone Ubuntu machine.

Start from installing Docker on the host.

The FUSE driver is a prerequisite for rclone mounting and should be
installed on host:

    sudo apt-get -y install fuse

Create two directories required by rclone docker plugin:

    sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config
    sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache

Install the managed rclone docker plugin for your architecture (here
amd64):

    docker plugin install rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64 args="-v" --alias rclone --grant-all-permissions
    docker plugin list

Create your SFTP volume:

    docker volume create firstvolume -d rclone -o type=sftp -o sftp-host=_hostname_ -o sftp-user=_username_ -o sftp-pass=_password_ -o allow-other=true

Note that since all options are static, you don't even have to run
rclone config or create the rclone.conf file (but the config directory
should still be present). In the simplest case you can use localhost as
hostname and your SSH credentials as username and password. You can also
change the remote path to your home directory on the host, for example
-o path=/home/username.

Time to create a test container and mount the volume into it:

    docker run --rm -it -v firstvolume:/mnt --workdir /mnt ubuntu:latest bash

If all goes well, you will enter the new container and change right to
the mounted SFTP remote. You can type ls to list the mounted directory
or otherwise play with it. Type exit when you are done. The container
will stop but the volume will stay, ready to be reused. When it's not
needed anymore, remove it:

    docker volume list
    docker volume remove firstvolume

Now let us try something more elaborate: Google Drive volume on
multi-node Docker Swarm.

You should start from installing Docker and FUSE, creating plugin
directories and installing rclone plugin on every swarm node. Then setup
the Swarm.

Google Drive volumes need an access token which can be setup via web
browser and will be periodically renewed by rclone. The managed plugin
cannot run a browser so we will use a technique similar to the rclone
setup on a headless box.

Run rclone config on another machine equipped with web browser and
graphical user interface. Create the Google Drive remote. When done,
transfer the resulting rclone.conf to the Swarm cluster and save as
/var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config/rclone.conf on every node. By
default this location is accessible only to the root user so you will
need appropriate privileges. The resulting config will look like this:

    [gdrive]
    type = drive
    scope = drive
    drive_id = 1234567...
    root_folder_id = 0Abcd...
    token = {"access_token":...}

Now create the file named example.yml with a swarm stack description
like this:

    version: '3'
    services:
      heimdall:
        image: linuxserver/heimdall:latest
        ports: [8080:80]
        volumes: [configdata:/config]
    volumes:
      configdata:
        driver: rclone
        driver_opts:
          remote: 'gdrive:heimdall'
          allow_other: 'true'
          vfs_cache_mode: full
          poll_interval: 0

and run the stack:

    docker stack deploy example -c ./example.yml

After a few seconds docker will spread the parsed stack description over
cluster, create the example_heimdall service on port 8080, run service
containers on one or more cluster nodes and request the
example_configdata volume from rclone plugins on the node hosts. You can
use the following commands to confirm results:

    docker service ls
    docker service ps example_heimdall
    docker volume ls

Point your browser to http://cluster.host.address:8080 and play with the
service. Stop it with docker stack remove example when you are done.
Note that the example_configdata volume(s) created on demand at the
cluster nodes will not be automatically removed together with the stack
but stay for future reuse. You can remove them manually by invoking the
docker volume remove example_configdata command on every node.

Creating Volumes via CLI

Volumes can be created with docker volume create. Here are a few
examples:

    docker volume create vol1 -d rclone -o remote=storj: -o vfs-cache-mode=full
    docker volume create vol2 -d rclone -o remote=:storj,access_grant=xxx:heimdall
    docker volume create vol3 -d rclone -o type=storj -o path=heimdall -o storj-access-grant=xxx -o poll-interval=0

Note the -d rclone flag that tells docker to request volume from the
rclone driver. This works even if you installed managed driver by its
full name rclone/docker-volume-rclone because you provided the
--alias rclone option.

Volumes can be inspected as follows:

    docker volume list
    docker volume inspect vol1

Volume Configuration

Rclone flags and volume options are set via the -o flag to the
docker volume create command. They include backend-specific parameters
as well as mount and VFS options. Also there are a few special -o
options: remote, fs, type, path, mount-type and persist.

remote determines an existing remote name from the config file, with
trailing colon and optionally with a remote path. See the full syntax in
the rclone documentation. This option can be aliased as fs to prevent
confusion with the remote parameter of such backends as crypt or alias.

The remote=:backend:dir/subdir syntax can be used to create on-the-fly
(config-less) remotes, while the type and path options provide a simpler
alternative for this. Using two split options

    -o type=backend -o path=dir/subdir

is equivalent to the combined syntax

    -o remote=:backend:dir/subdir

but is arguably easier to parameterize in scripts. The path part is
optional.

Mount and VFS options as well as backend parameters are named like their
twin command-line flags without the -- CLI prefix. Optionally you can
use underscores instead of dashes in option names. For example,
--vfs-cache-mode full becomes -o vfs-cache-mode=full or
-o vfs_cache_mode=full. Boolean CLI flags without value will gain the
true value, e.g. --allow-other becomes -o allow-other=true or
-o allow_other=true.

Please note that you can provide parameters only for the backend
immediately referenced by the backend type of mounted remote. If this is
a wrapping backend like alias, chunker or crypt, you cannot provide
options for the referred to remote or backend. This limitation is
imposed by the rclone connection string parser. The only workaround is
to feed plugin with rclone.conf or configure plugin arguments (see
below).

Special Volume Options

mount-type determines the mount method and in general can be one of:
mount, cmount, or mount2. This can be aliased as mount_type. It should
be noted that the managed rclone docker plugin currently does not
support the cmount method and mount2 is rarely needed. This option
defaults to the first found method, which is usually mount so you
generally won't need it.

persist is a reserved boolean (true/false) option. In future it will
allow to persist on-the-fly remotes in the plugin rclone.conf file.

Connection Strings

The remote value can be extended with connection strings as an
alternative way to supply backend parameters. This is equivalent to the
-o backend options with one syntactic difference. Inside connection
string the backend prefix must be dropped from parameter names but in
the -o param=value array it must be present. For instance, compare the
following option array

    -o remote=:sftp:/home -o sftp-host=localhost

with equivalent connection string:

    -o remote=:sftp,host=localhost:/home

This difference exists because flag options -o key=val include not only
backend parameters but also mount/VFS flags and possibly other settings.
Also it allows to discriminate the remote option from the crypt-remote
(or similarly named backend parameters) and arguably simplifies
scripting due to clearer value substitution.

Using with Swarm or Compose

Both Docker Swarm and Docker Compose use YAML-formatted text files to
describe groups (stacks) of containers, their properties, networks and
volumes. Compose uses the compose v2 format, Swarm uses the compose v3
format. They are mostly similar, differences are explained in the docker
documentation.

Volumes are described by the children of the top-level volumes: node.
Each of them should be named after its volume and have at least two
elements, the self-explanatory driver: rclone value and the driver_opts:
structure playing the same role as -o key=val CLI flags:

    volumes:
      volume_name_1:
        driver: rclone
        driver_opts:
          remote: 'gdrive:'
          allow_other: 'true'
          vfs_cache_mode: full
          token: '{"type": "borrower", "expires": "2021-12-31"}'
          poll_interval: 0

Notice a few important details: - YAML prefers _ in option names instead
of -. - YAML treats single and double quotes interchangeably. Simple
strings and integers can be left unquoted. - Boolean values must be
quoted like 'true' or "false" because these two words are reserved by
YAML. - The filesystem string is keyed with remote (or with fs).
Normally you can omit quotes here, but if the string ends with colon,
you must quote it like remote: "storage_box:". - YAML is picky about
surrounding braces in values as this is in fact another syntax for
key/value mappings. For example, JSON access tokens usually contain
double quotes and surrounding braces, so you must put them in single
quotes.

Installing as Managed Plugin

Docker daemon can install plugins from an image registry and run them
managed. We maintain the docker-volume-rclone plugin image on Docker
Hub.

Rclone volume plugin requires Docker Engine >= 19.03.15

The plugin requires presence of two directories on the host before it
can be installed. Note that plugin will not create them automatically.
By default they must exist on host at the following locations (though
you can tweak the paths): - /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config is
reserved for the rclone.conf config file and must exist even if it's
empty and the config file is not present. -
/var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache holds the plugin state file as well
as optional VFS caches.

You can install managed plugin with default settings as follows:

    docker plugin install rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64 --grant-all-permissions --alias rclone

The :amd64 part of the image specification after colon is called a tag.
Usually you will want to install the latest plugin for your
architecture. In this case the tag will just name it, like amd64 above.
The following plugin architectures are currently available: - amd64 -
arm64 - arm-v7

Sometimes you might want a concrete plugin version, not the latest one.
Then you should use image tag in the form :ARCHITECTURE-VERSION. For
example, to install plugin version v1.56.2 on architecture arm64 you
will use tag arm64-1.56.2 (note the removed v) so the full image
specification becomes rclone/docker-volume-rclone:arm64-1.56.2.

We also provide the latest plugin tag, but since docker does not support
multi-architecture plugins as of the time of this writing, this tag is
currently an alias for amd64. By convention the latest tag is the
default one and can be omitted, thus both
rclone/docker-volume-rclone:latest and just rclone/docker-volume-rclone
will refer to the latest plugin release for the amd64 platform.

Also the amd64 part can be omitted from the versioned rclone plugin
tags. For example, rclone image reference
rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64-1.56.2 can be abbreviated as
rclone/docker-volume-rclone:1.56.2 for convenience. However, for
non-intel architectures you still have to use the full tag as amd64 or
latest will fail to start.

Managed plugin is in fact a special container running in a namespace
separate from normal docker containers. Inside it runs the
rclone serve docker command. The config and cache directories are
bind-mounted into the container at start. The docker daemon connects to
a unix socket created by the command inside the container. The command
creates on-demand remote mounts right inside, then docker machinery
propagates them through kernel mount namespaces and bind-mounts into
requesting user containers.

You can tweak a few plugin settings after installation when it's
disabled (not in use), for instance:

    docker plugin disable rclone
    docker plugin set rclone RCLONE_VERBOSE=2 config=/etc/rclone args="--vfs-cache-mode=writes --allow-other"
    docker plugin enable rclone
    docker plugin inspect rclone

Note that if docker refuses to disable the plugin, you should find and
remove all active volumes connected with it as well as containers and
swarm services that use them. This is rather tedious so please carefully
plan in advance.

You can tweak the following settings: args, config, cache, HTTP_PROXY,
HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY and RCLONE_VERBOSE. It's your task to keep plugin
settings in sync across swarm cluster nodes.

args sets command-line arguments for the rclone serve docker command
(none by default). Arguments should be separated by space so you will
normally want to put them in quotes on the docker plugin set command
line. Both serve docker flags and generic rclone flags are supported,
including backend parameters that will be used as defaults for volume
creation. Note that plugin will fail (due to this docker bug) if the
args value is empty. Use e.g. args="-v" as a workaround.

config=/host/dir sets alternative host location for the config
directory. Plugin will look for rclone.conf here. It's not an error if
the config file is not present but the directory must exist. Please note
that plugin can periodically rewrite the config file, for example when
it renews storage access tokens. Keep this in mind and try to avoid
races between the plugin and other instances of rclone on the host that
might try to change the config simultaneously resulting in corrupted
rclone.conf. You can also put stuff like private key files for SFTP
remotes in this directory. Just note that it's bind-mounted inside the
plugin container at the predefined path /data/config. For example, if
your key file is named sftp-box1.key on the host, the corresponding
volume config option should read
-o sftp-key-file=/data/config/sftp-box1.key.

cache=/host/dir sets alternative host location for the cache directory.
The plugin will keep VFS caches here. Also it will create and maintain
the docker-plugin.state file in this directory. When the plugin is
restarted or reinstalled, it will look in this file to recreate any
volumes that existed previously. However, they will not be re-mounted
into consuming containers after restart. Usually this is not a problem
as the docker daemon normally will restart affected user containers
after failures, daemon restarts or host reboots.

RCLONE_VERBOSE sets plugin verbosity from 0 (errors only, by default) to
2 (debugging). Verbosity can be also tweaked via args="-v [-v] ...".
Since arguments are more generic, you will rarely need this setting. The
plugin output by default feeds the docker daemon log on local host. Log
entries are reflected as errors in the docker log but retain their
actual level assigned by rclone in the encapsulated message string.

HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY customize the plugin proxy settings.

You can set custom plugin options right when you install it, in one go:

    docker plugin remove rclone
    docker plugin install rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64 \
           --alias rclone --grant-all-permissions \
           args="-v --allow-other" config=/etc/rclone
    docker plugin inspect rclone

Healthchecks

The docker plugin volume protocol doesn't provide a way for plugins to
inform the docker daemon that a volume is (un-)available. As a
workaround you can setup a healthcheck to verify that the mount is
responding, for example:

    services:
      my_service:
        image: my_image
        healthcheck:
          test: ls /path/to/rclone/mount || exit 1
          interval: 1m
          timeout: 15s
          retries: 3
          start_period: 15s

Running Plugin under Systemd

In most cases you should prefer managed mode. Moreover, MacOS and
Windows do not support native Docker plugins. Please use managed mode on
these systems. Proceed further only if you are on Linux.

First, install rclone. You can just run it (type rclone serve docker and
hit enter) for the test.

Install FUSE:

    sudo apt-get -y install fuse

Download two systemd configuration files: docker-volume-rclone.service
and docker-volume-rclone.socket.

Put them to the /etc/systemd/system/ directory:

    cp docker-volume-plugin.service /etc/systemd/system/
    cp docker-volume-plugin.socket  /etc/systemd/system/

Please note that all commands in this section must be run as root but we
omit sudo prefix for brevity. Now create directories required by the
service:

    mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-volumes/rclone
    mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config
    mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache

Run the docker plugin service in the socket activated mode:

    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl start docker-volume-rclone.service
    systemctl enable docker-volume-rclone.socket
    systemctl start docker-volume-rclone.socket
    systemctl restart docker

Or run the service directly: - run systemctl daemon-reload to let
systemd pick up new config - run
systemctl enable docker-volume-rclone.service to make the new service
start automatically when you power on your machine. - run
systemctl start docker-volume-rclone.service to start the service now. -
run systemctl restart docker to restart docker daemon and let it detect
the new plugin socket. Note that this step is not needed in managed mode
where docker knows about plugin state changes.

The two methods are equivalent from the user perspective, but I
personally prefer socket activation.

Troubleshooting

You can see managed plugin settings with

    docker plugin list
    docker plugin inspect rclone

Note that docker (including latest 20.10.7) will not show actual values
of args, just the defaults.

Use journalctl --unit docker to see managed plugin output as part of the
docker daemon log. Note that docker reflects plugin lines as errors but
their actual level can be seen from encapsulated message string.

You will usually install the latest version of managed plugin for your
platform. Use the following commands to print the actual installed
version:

    PLUGID=$(docker plugin list --no-trunc | awk '/rclone/{print$1}')
    sudo runc --root /run/docker/runtime-runc/plugins.moby exec $PLUGID rclone version

You can even use runc to run shell inside the plugin container:

    sudo runc --root /run/docker/runtime-runc/plugins.moby exec --tty $PLUGID bash

Also you can use curl to check the plugin socket connectivity:

    docker plugin list --no-trunc
    PLUGID=123abc...
    sudo curl -H Content-Type:application/json -XPOST -d {} --unix-socket /run/docker/plugins/$PLUGID/rclone.sock http://localhost/Plugin.Activate

though this is rarely needed.

Caveats

Finally I'd like to mention a caveat with updating volume settings.
Docker CLI does not have a dedicated command like docker volume update.
It may be tempting to invoke docker volume create with updated options
on existing volume, but there is a gotcha. The command will do nothing,
it won't even return an error. I hope that docker maintainers will fix
this some day. In the meantime be aware that you must remove your volume
before recreating it with new settings:

    docker volume remove my_vol
    docker volume create my_vol -d rclone -o opt1=new_val1 ...

and verify that settings did update:

    docker volume list
    docker volume inspect my_vol

If docker refuses to remove the volume, you should find containers or
swarm services that use it and stop them first.

Getting started

-   Install rclone and setup your remotes.
-   Bisync will create its working directory at ~/.cache/rclone/bisync
    on Linux or C:\Users\MyLogin\AppData\Local\rclone\bisync on Windows.
    Make sure that this location is writable.
-   Run bisync with the --resync flag, specifying the paths to the local
    and remote sync directory roots.
-   For successive sync runs, leave off the --resync flag.
-   Consider using a filters file for excluding unnecessary files and
    directories from the sync.
-   Consider setting up the --check-access feature for safety.
-   On Linux, consider setting up a crontab entry. bisync can safely run
    in concurrent cron jobs thanks to lock files it maintains.

Here is a typical run log (with timestamps removed for clarity):

      rclone bisync remote1:path1 remote2:path2 [flags]

    Positional arguments:
      Path1, Path2  Local path, or remote storage with ':' plus optional path.
                    Type 'rclone listremotes' for list of configured remotes.

    Optional Flags:
          --check-access            Ensure expected `RCLONE_TEST` files are found on
                                    both Path1 and Path2 filesystems, else abort.
          --check-filename FILENAME Filename for `--check-access` (default: `RCLONE_TEST`)
          --check-sync CHOICE       Controls comparison of final listings:
                                    `true | false | only` (default: true)
                                    If set to `only`, bisync will only compare listings
                                    from the last run but skip actual sync.
          --filters-file PATH       Read filtering patterns from a file
          --max-delete PERCENT      Safety check on maximum percentage of deleted files allowed.
                                    If exceeded, the bisync run will abort. (default: 50%)
          --force                   Bypass `--max-delete` safety check and run the sync.
                                    Consider using with `--verbose`
          --remove-empty-dirs       Remove empty directories at the final cleanup step.
      -1, --resync                  Performs the resync run.
                                    Warning: Path1 files may overwrite Path2 versions.

      -h, --help                    help for bisync

Arbitrary rclone flags may be specified on the bisync command line, for
example
rclone bsync ./testdir/path1/ gdrive:testdir/path2/ --drive-skip-gdocs -v -v --timeout 10s
Note that interactions of various rclone flags with bisync process flow
has not been fully tested yet.

Paths

Path1 and Path2 arguments may be references to any mix of local
directory paths (absolute or relative), UNC paths (//server/share/path),
Windows drive paths (with a drive letter and :) or configured remotes
with optional subdirectory paths. Cloud references are distinguished by
having a : in the argument (see Windows support below).

Path1 and Path2 are treated equally, in that neither has priority for
file changes, and access efficiency does not change whether a remote is
on Path1 or Path2.

The listings in bisync working directory (default:
~/.cache/rclone/bisync) are named based on the Path1 and Path2 arguments
so that separate syncs to individual directories within the tree may be
set up, e.g.: path_to_local_tree..dropbox_subdir.lst.

Any empty directories after the sync on both the Path1 and Path2
filesystems are not deleted by default. If the --remove-empty-dirs flag
is specified, then both paths will have any empty directories purged as
the last step in the process.

Command-line flags

--resync

This will effectively make both Path1 and Path2 filesystems contain a
matching superset of all files. Path2 files that do not exist in Path1
will be copied to Path1, and the process will then sync the Path1 tree
to Path2.

The base directories on the both Path1 and Path2 filesystems must exist
or bisync will fail. This is required for safety - that bisync can
verify that both paths are valid.

When using --resync a newer version of a file on the Path2 filesystem
will be overwritten by the Path1 filesystem version. Carefully evaluate
deltas using --dry-run.

For a resync run, one of the paths may be empty (no files in the path
tree). The resync run should result in files on both paths, else a
normal non-resync run will fail.

For a non-resync run, either path being empty (no files in the tree)
fails with
Empty current PathN listing. Cannot sync to an empty directory: X.pathN.lst
This is a safety check that an unexpected empty path does not result in
deleting everything in the other path.

--check-access

Access check files are an additional safety measure against data loss.
bisync will ensure it can find matching RCLONE_TEST files in the same
places in the Path1 and Path2 filesystems. Time stamps and file contents
are not important, just the names and locations. Place one or more
RCLONE_TEST files in the Path1 or Path2 filesystem and then do either a
run without --check-access or a --resync to set matching files on both
filesystems. If you have symbolic links in your sync tree it is
recommended to place RCLONE_TEST files in the linked-to directory tree
to protect against bisync assuming a bunch of deleted files if the
linked-to tree should not be accessible. Also see the --check-filename
flag.

--max-delete

As a safety check, if greater than the --max-delete percent of files
were deleted on either the Path1 or Path2 filesystem, then bisync will
abort with a warning message, without making any changes. The default
--max-delete is 50%. One way to trigger this limit is to rename a
directory that contains more than half of your files. This will appear
to bisync as a bunch of deleted files and a bunch of new files. This
safety check is intended to block bisync from deleting all of the files
on both filesystems due to a temporary network access issue, or if the
user had inadvertently deleted the files on one side or the other. To
force the sync either set a different delete percentage limit, e.g.
--max-delete 75 (allows up to 75% deletion), or use --force to bypass
the check.

Also see the all files changed check.

--filters-file

By using rclone filter features you can exclude file types or directory
sub-trees from the sync. See the bisync filters section and generic
--filter-from documentation. An example filters file contains filters
for non-allowed files for synching with Dropbox.

If you make changes to your filters file then bisync requires a run with
--resync. This is a safety feature, which avoids existing files on the
Path1 and/or Path2 side from seeming to disappear from view (since they
are excluded in the new listings), which would fool bisync into seeing
them as deleted (as compared to the prior run listings), and then bisync
would proceed to delete them for real.

To block this from happening bisync calculates an MD5 hash of the
filters file and stores the hash in a .md5 file in the same place as
your filters file. On the next runs with --filters-file set, bisync
re-calculates the MD5 hash of the current filters file and compares it
to the hash stored in .md5 file. If they don't match the run aborts with
a critical error and thus forces you to do a --resync, likely avoiding a
disaster.

--check-sync

Enabled by default, the check-sync function checks that all of the same
files exist in both the Path1 and Path2 history listings. This
check-sync integrity check is performed at the end of the sync run by
default. Any untrapped failing copy/deletes between the two paths might
result in differences between the two listings and in the untracked file
content differences between the two paths. A resync run would correct
the error.

Note that the default-enabled integrity check locally executes a load of
both the final Path1 and Path2 listings, and thus adds to the run time
of a sync. Using --check-sync=false will disable it and may
significantly reduce the sync run times for very large numbers of files.

The check may be run manually with --check-sync=only. It runs only the
integrity check and terminates without actually synching.

Operation

Runtime flow details

bisync retains the listings of the Path1 and Path2 filesystems from the
prior run. On each successive run it will:

-   list files on path1 and path2, and check for changes on each side.
    Changes include New, Newer, Older, and Deleted files.
-   Propagate changes on path1 to path2, and vice-versa.

Safety measures

-   Lock file prevents multiple simultaneous runs when taking a while.
    This can be particularly useful if bisync is run by cron scheduler.
-   Handle change conflicts non-destructively by creating ..path1 and
    ..path2 file versions.
-   File system access health check using RCLONE_TEST files (see the
    --check-access flag).
-   Abort on excessive deletes - protects against a failed listing being
    interpreted as all the files were deleted. See the --max-delete and
    --force flags.
-   If something evil happens, bisync goes into a safe state to block
    damage by later runs. (See Error Handling)

All files changed check

if all prior existing files on either of the filesystems have changed
(e.g. timestamps have changed due to changing the system's timezone)
then bisync will abort without making any changes. Any new files are not
considered for this check. You could use --force to force the sync
(whichever side has the changed timestamp files wins). Alternately, a
--resync may be used (Path1 versions will be pushed to Path2). Consider
the situation carefully and perhaps use --dry-run before you commit to
the changes.

Modification time

Bisync relies on file timestamps to identify changed files and will
refuse to operate if backend lacks the modification time support.

If you or your application should change the content of a file without
changing the modification time then bisync will not notice the change,
and thus will not copy it to the other side.

Note that on some cloud storage systems it is not possible to have file
timestamps that match precisely between the local and other filesystems.

Bisync's approach to this problem is by tracking the changes on each
side separately over time with a local database of files in that side
then applying the resulting changes on the other side.

Error handling

Certain bisync critical errors, such as file copy/move failing, will
result in a bisync lockout of following runs. The lockout is asserted
because the sync status and history of the Path1 and Path2 filesystems
cannot be trusted, so it is safer to block any further changes until
someone checks things out. The recovery is to do a --resync again.

It is recommended to use --resync --dry-run --verbose initially and
carefully review what changes will be made before running the --resync
without --dry-run.

Most of these events come up due to a error status from an internal
call. On such a critical error the {...}.path1.lst and {...}.path2.lst
listing files are renamed to extension .lst-err, which blocks any future
bisync runs (since the normal .lst files are not found). Bisync keeps
them under bisync subdirectory of the rclone cache direcory, typically
at ${HOME}/.cache/rclone/bisync/ on Linux.

Some errors are considered temporary and re-running the bisync is not
blocked. The critical return blocks further bisync runs.

Lock file

When bisync is running, a lock file is created in the bisync working
directory, typically at ~/.cache/rclone/bisync/PATH1..PATH2.lck on
Linux. If bisync should crash or hang, the lock file will remain in
place and block any further runs of bisync for the same paths. Delete
the lock file as part of debugging the situation. The lock file
effectively blocks follow-on (e.g., scheduled by cron) runs when the
prior invocation is taking a long time. The lock file contains PID of
the blocking process, which may help in debug.

Note that while concurrent bisync runs are allowed, be very cautious
that there is no overlap in the trees being synched between concurrent
runs, lest there be replicated files, deleted files and general mayhem.

Return codes

rclone bisync returns the following codes to calling program: - 0 on a
successful run, - 1 for a non-critical failing run (a rerun may be
successful), - 2 for a critically aborted run (requires a --resync to
recover).

Limitations

Supported backends

Bisync is considered BETA and has been tested with the following
backends: - Local filesystem - Google Drive - Dropbox - OneDrive - S3 -
SFTP

It has not been fully tested with other services yet. If it works, or
sorta works, please let us know and we'll update the list. Run the test
suite to check for proper operation as described below.

First release of rclone bisync requires that underlying backend
supported the modification time feature and will refuse to run
otherwise. This limitation will be lifted in a future rclone bisync
release.

Concurrent modifications

When using Local, FTP or SFTP remotes rclone does not create temporary
files at the destination when copying, and thus if the connection is
lost the created file may be corrupt, which will likely propagate back
to the original path on the next sync, resulting in data loss. This will
be solved in a future release, there is no workaround at the moment.

Files that change during a bisync run may result in data loss. This has
been seen in a highly dynamic environment, where the filesystem is
getting hammered by running processes during the sync. The solution is
to sync at quiet times or filter out unnecessary directories and files.

Empty directories

New empty directories on one path are not propagated to the other side.
This is because bisync (and rclone) natively works on files not
directories. The following sequence is a workaround but will not
propagate the delete of an empty directory to the other side:

    rclone bisync PATH1 PATH2
    rclone copy PATH1 PATH2 --filter "+ */" --filter "- **" --create-empty-src-dirs
    rclone copy PATH2 PATH2 --filter "+ */" --filter "- **" --create-empty-src-dirs

Renamed directories

Renaming a folder on the Path1 side results is deleting all files on the
Path2 side and then copying all files again from Path1 to Path2. Bisync
sees this as all files in the old directory name as deleted and all
files in the new directory name as new. Similarly, renaming a directory
on both sides to the same name will result in creating ..path1 and
..path2 files on both sides. Currently the most effective and efficient
method of renaming a directory is to rename it on both sides, then do a
--resync.

Case sensitivity

Synching with case-insensitive filesystems, such as Windows or Box, can
result in file name conflicts. This will be fixed in a future release.
The near term workaround is to make sure that files on both sides don't
have spelling case differences (Smile.jpg vs. smile.jpg).

Windows support

Bisync has been tested on Windows 8.1, Windows 10 Pro 64-bit and on
Windows Github runners.

Drive letters are allowed, including drive letters mapped to network
drives (rclone bisync J:\localsync GDrive:). If a drive letter is
omitted, the shell current drive is the default. Drive letters are a
single character follows by :, so cloud names must be more than one
character long.

Absolute paths (with or without a drive letter), and relative paths
(with or without a drive letter) are supported.

Working directory is created at
C:\Users\MyLogin\AppData\Local\rclone\bisync.

Note that bisync output may show a mix of forward / and back \ slashes.

Be careful of case independent directory and file naming on Windows vs.
case dependent Linux

Filtering

See filtering documentation for how filter rules are written and
interpreted.

Bisync's --filters-file flag slightly extends the rclone's --filter-from
filtering mechanism. For a given bisync run you may provide only one
--filters-file. The --include*, --exclude*, and --filter flags are also
supported.

How to filter directories

Filtering portions of the directory tree is a critical feature for
synching.

Examples of directory trees (always beneath the Path1/Path2 root level)
you may want to exclude from your sync: - Directory trees containing
only software build intermediate files. - Directory trees containing
application temporary files and data such as the Windows
C:\Users\MyLogin\AppData\ tree. - Directory trees containing files that
are large, less important, or are getting thrashed continuously by
ongoing processes.

On the other hand, there may be only select directories that you
actually want to sync, and exclude all others. See the Example
include-style filters for Windows user directories below.

Filters file writing guidelines

1.  Begin with excluding directory trees:
    -   e.g. `- /AppData/`
    -   ** on the end is not necessary. Once a given directory level is
        excluded then everything beneath it won't be looked at by
        rclone.
    -   Exclude such directories that are unneeded, are big, dynamically
        thrashed, or where there may be access permission issues.
    -   Excluding such dirs first will make rclone operations (much)
        faster.
    -   Specific files may also be excluded, as with the Dropbox
        exclusions example below.
2.  Decide if its easier (or cleaner) to:
    -   Include select directories and therefore exclude everything else
        -- or --
    -   Exclude select directories and therefore include everything else
3.  Include select directories:
    -   Add lines like: `+ /Documents/PersonalFiles/**` to select which
        directories to include in the sync.
    -   ** on the end specifies to include the full depth of the
        specified tree.
    -   With Include-style filters, files at the Path1/Path2 root are
        not included. They may be included with `+ /*`.
    -   Place RCLONE_TEST files within these included directory trees.
        They will only be looked for in these directory trees.
    -   Finish by excluding everything else by adding `- **` at the end
        of the filters file.
    -   Disregard step 4.
4.  Exclude select directories:
    -   Add more lines like in step 1. For example:
        -/Desktop/tempfiles/, or `- /testdir/.    Again, a**` on the end
        is not necessary.
    -   Do not add a `- **` in the file. Without this line, everything
        will be included that has not be explicitly excluded.
    -   Disregard step 3.

A few rules for the syntax of a filter file expanding on filtering
documentation:

-   Lines may start with spaces and tabs - rclone strips leading
    whitespace.
-   If the first non-whitespace character is a # then the line is a
    comment and will be ignored.
-   Blank lines are ignored.
-   The first non-whitespace character on a filter line must be a + or
    -.
-   Exactly 1 space is allowed between the +/- and the path term.
-   Only forward slashes (/) are used in path terms, even on Windows.
-   The rest of the line is taken as the path term. Trailing whitespace
    is taken literally, and probably is an error.

Example include-style filters for Windows user directories

This Windows include-style example is based on the sync root (Path1) set
to C:\Users\MyLogin. The strategy is to select specific directories to
be synched with a network drive (Path2).

-   `- /AppData/` excludes an entire tree of Windows stored stuff that
    need not be synched. In my case, AppData has >11 GB of stuff I don't
    care about, and there are some subdirectories beneath AppData that
    are not accessible to my user login, resulting in bisync critical
    aborts.
-   Windows creates cache files starting with both upper and lowercase
    NTUSER at C:\Users\MyLogin. These files may be dynamic, locked, and
    are generally don't care.
-   There are just a few directories with my data that I do want
    synched, in the form of `+
    /. By selecting only the directory trees I   want to avoid the dozen plus directories that various apps make   atC:`.
-   Include files in the root of the sync point, C:\Users\MyLogin, by
    adding the `+ /*` line.
-   This is an Include-style filters file, therefore it ends with `- **`
    which excludes everything not explicitly included.

    - /AppData/
    - NTUSER*
    - ntuser*
    + /Documents/Family/**
    + /Documents/Sketchup/**
    + /Documents/Microcapture_Photo/**
    + /Documents/Microcapture_Video/**
    + /Desktop/**
    + /Pictures/**
    + /*
    - **

Note also that Windows implements several "library" links such as
C:\Users\MyLogin\My Documents\My Music pointing to
C:\Users\MyLogin\Music. rclone sees these as links, so you must add
--links to the bisync command line if you which to follow these links. I
find that I get permission errors in trying to follow the links, so I
don't include the rclone --links flag, but then you get lots of
Can't follow symlink… noise from rclone about not following the links.
This noise can be quashed by adding --quiet to the bisync command line.

Example exclude-style filters files for use with Dropbox

-   Dropbox disallows synching the listed temporary and
    configuration/data files. The `- ` filters exclude these files where
    ever they may occur in the sync tree. Consider adding similar
    exclusions for file types you don't need to sync, such as core dump
    and software build files.
-   bisync testing creates /testdir/ at the top level of the sync tree,
    and usually deletes the tree after the test. If a normal sync should
    run while the /testdir/ tree exists the --check-access phase may
    fail due to unbalanced RCLONE_TEST files. The `- /testdir/` filter
    blocks this tree from being synched. You don't need this exclusion
    if you are not doing bisync development testing.
-   Everything else beneath the Path1/Path2 root will be synched.
-   RCLONE_TEST files may be placed anywhere within the tree, including

How --check-access handles filters

At the start of a bisync run, listings are gathered for Path1 and Path2
while using the user's --filters-file. During the check access phase,
bisync scans these listings for RCLONE_TEST files. Any RCLONE_TEST files
hidden by the --filters-file are not in the listings and thus not
checked during the check access phase.

Troubleshooting

Reading bisync logs

Here are two normal runs. The first one has a newer file on the remote.
The second has no deltas between local and remote.

    2021/05/16 00:24:38 INFO  : Synching Path1 "/path/to/local/tree/" with Path2 "dropbox:/"

    2021/05/16 00:36:52 INFO  : Bisync successful

Dry run oddity

The --dry-run messages may indicate that it would try to delete some
files. For example, if a file is new on Path2 and does not exist on
Path1 then it would normally be copied to Path1, but with --dry-run
enabled those copies don't happen, which leads to the attempted delete
on the Path2, blocked again by --dry-run: ... Not deleting as --dry-run.

This whole confusing situation is an artifact of the --dry-run flag.
Scrutinize the proposed deletes carefully, and if the files would have
been copied to Path1 then the threatened deletes on Path2 may be
disregarded.

Retries

Rclone has built in retries. If you run with --verbose you'll see error
and retry messages such as shown below. This is usually not a bug. If at
the end of the run you see Bisync successful and not
Bisync critical error or Bisync aborted then the run was successful, and
you can ignore the error messages.

The following run shows an intermittent fail. Lines 5 and _6- are low
level messages. Line 6 is a bubbled-up warning message, conveying the
error. Rclone normally retries failing commands, so there may be
numerous such messages in the log.

Since there are no final error/warning messages on line 7, rclone has
recovered from failure after a retry, and the overall sync was
successful.

Denied downloads of "infected" or "abusive" files

Google Drive has a filter for certain file types (.exe, .apk, et cetera)
that by default cannot be copied from Google Drive to the local
filesystem. If you are having problems, run with --verbose to see
specifically which files are generating complaints. If the error is
This file has been identified as malware or spam and cannot be downloaded,
consider using the flag --drive-acknowledge-abuse.

Google Doc files

Google docs exist as virtual files on Google Drive and cannot be
transferred to other filesystems natively. While it is possible to
export a Google doc to a normal file (with .xlsx extension, for
example), it's not possible to import a normal file back into a Google
document.

Bisync's handling of Google Doc files is to flag them in the run log
output for user's attention and ignore them for any file transfers,
deletes, or syncs. They will show up with a length of -1 in the
listings. This bisync run is otherwise successful:

    2021/05/11 08:23:15 INFO  : Synching Path1 "/path/to/local/tree/base/" with Path2 "GDrive:"

Usage examples

Cron

Rclone does not yet have a built-in capability to monitor the local file
system for changes and must be blindly run periodically. On Windows this
can be done using a Task Scheduler, on Linux you can use Cron which is
described below.

The 1st example runs a sync every 5 minutes between a local directory
and an OwnCloud server, with output logged to a runlog file:

    # Minute (0-59)
    #      Hour (0-23)
    #           Day of Month (1-31)
    #                Month (1-12 or Jan-Dec)
    #                     Day of Week (0-6 or Sun-Sat)
    #                         Command
      */5  *    *    *    *   /path/to/rclone bisync /local/files MyCloud: --check-access --filters-file /path/to/bysync-filters.txt --log-file /path/to//bisync.log

See crontab syntax). for the details of crontab time interval
expressions.

If you run rclone bisync as a cron job, redirect stdout/stderr to a
file. The 2nd example runs a sync to Dropbox every hour and logs all
stdout (via the >>) and stderr (via 2>&1) to a log file.

    0 * * * * /path/to/rclone bisync /path/to/local/dropbox Dropbox: --check-access --filters-file /home/user/filters.txt >> /path/to/logs/dropbox-run.log 2>&1

Sharing an encrypted folder tree between hosts

bisync can keep a local folder in sync with a cloud service, but what if
you have some highly sensitive files to be synched?

Usage of a cloud service is for exchanging both routine and sensitive
personal files between one's home network, one's personal notebook when
on the road, and with one's work computer. The routine data is not
sensitive. For the sensitive data, configure an rclone crypt remote to
point to a subdirectory within the local disk tree that is bisync'd to
Dropbox, and then set up an bisync for this local crypt directory to a
directory outside of the main sync tree.

Linux server setup

-   /path/to/DBoxroot is the root of my local sync tree. There are
    numerous subdirectories.
-   /path/to/DBoxroot/crypt is the root subdirectory for files that are
    encrypted. This local directory target is setup as an rclone crypt
    remote named Dropcrypt:. See rclone.conf snippet below.
-   /path/to/my/unencrypted/files is the root of my sensitive files -
    not encrypted, not within the tree synched to Dropbox.
-   To sync my local unencrypted files with the encrypted Dropbox
    versions I manually run
    bisync /path/to/my/unencrypted/files DropCrypt:. This step could be
    bundled into a script to run before and after the full Dropbox tree
    sync in the last step, thus actively keeping the sensitive files in
    sync.
-   bisync /path/to/DBoxroot Dropbox: runs periodically via cron,
    keeping my full local sync tree in sync with Dropbox.

Windows notebook setup

-   The Dropbox client runs keeping the local tree
    C:\Users\MyLogin\Dropbox always in sync with Dropbox. I could have
    used rclone bisync instead.
-   A separate directory tree at C:\Users\MyLogin\Documents\DropLocal
    hosts the tree of unencrypted files/folders.
-   To sync my local unencrypted files with the encrypted Dropbox
    versions I manually run the following command:
    rclone bisync C:\Users\MyLogin\Documents\DropLocal Dropcrypt:.
-   The Dropbox client then syncs the changes with Dropbox.

rclone.conf snippet

    [Dropbox]
    type = dropbox
    ...

    [Dropcrypt]
    type = crypt
    remote = /path/to/DBoxroot/crypt          # on the Linux server
    remote = C:\Users\MyLogin\Dropbox\crypt   # on the Windows notebook
    filename_encryption = standard
    directory_name_encryption = true
    password = ...
    ...

Testing

You should read this section only if you are developing for rclone. You
need to have rclone source code locally to work with bisync tests.

Bisync has a dedicated test framework implemented in the bisync_test.go
file located in the rclone source tree. The test suite is based on the
go test command. Series of tests are stored in subdirectories below the
cmd/bisync/testdata directory. Individual tests can be invoked by their
directory name, e.g.
go test . -case basic -remote local -remote2 gdrive: -v

Tests will make a temporary folder on remote and purge it afterwards. If
during test run there are intermittent errors and rclone retries, these
errors will be captured and flagged as invalid MISCOMPAREs. Rerunning
the test will let it pass. Consider such failures as noise.

Test command syntax

    usage: go test ./cmd/bisync [options...]

    Options:
      -case NAME        Name(s) of the test case(s) to run. Multiple names should
                        be separated by commas. You can remove the `test_` prefix
                        and replace `_` by `-` in test name for convenience.
                        If not `all`, the name(s) should map to a directory under
                        `./cmd/bisync/testdata`.
                        Use `all` to run all tests (default: all)
      -remote PATH1     `local` or name of cloud service with `:` (default: local)
      -remote2 PATH2    `local` or name of cloud service with `:` (default: local)
      -no-compare       Disable comparing test results with the golden directory
                        (default: compare)
      -no-cleanup       Disable cleanup of Path1 and Path2 testdirs.
                        Useful for troubleshooting. (default: cleanup)
      -golden           Store results in the golden directory (default: false)
                        This flag can be used with multiple tests.
      -debug            Print debug messages
      -stop-at NUM      Stop test after given step number. (default: run to the end)
                        Implies `-no-compare` and `-no-cleanup`, if the test really
                        ends prematurely. Only meaningful for a single test case.
      -refresh-times    Force refreshing the target modtime, useful for Dropbox
                        (default: false)
      -verbose          Run tests verbosely

Note: unlike rclone flags which must be prefixed by double dash (--),
the test command flags can be equally prefixed by a single - or double
dash.

Running tests

-   go test . -case basic -remote local -remote2 local runs the
    test_basic test case using only the local filesystem, synching one
    local directory with another local directory. Test script output is
    to the console, while commands within scenario.txt have their output
    sent to the .../workdir/test.log file, which is finally compared to
    the golden copy.
-   The first argument after go test should be a relative name of the
    directory containing bisync source code. If you run tests right from
    there, the argument will be . (current directory) as in most
    examples below. If you run bisync tests from the rclone source
    directory, the command should be go test ./cmd/bisync ....
-   The test engine will mangle rclone output to ensure comparability
    with golden listings and logs.
-   Test scenarios are located in ./cmd/bisync/testdata. The test -case
    argument should match the full name of a subdirectory under that
    directory. Every test subdirectory name on disk must start with
    test_, this prefix can be omitted on command line for brevity. Also,
    underscores in the name can be replaced by dashes for convenience.
-   go test . -remote local -remote2 local -case all runs all tests.
-   Path1 and Path2 may either be the keyword local or may be names of
    configured cloud services.
    go test . -remote gdrive: -remote2 dropbox: -case basic will run the
    test between these two services, without transferring any files to
    the local filesystem.
-   Test run stdout and stderr console output may be directed to a file,
    e.g.
    go test . -remote gdrive: -remote2 local -case all > runlog.txt 2>&1

Test execution flow

1.  The base setup in the initial directory of the testcase is applied
    on the Path1 and Path2 filesystems (via rclone copy the initial
    directory to Path1, then rclone sync Path1 to Path2).
2.  The commands in the scenario.txt file are applied, with output
    directed to the test.log file in the test working directory.
    Typically, the first actual command in the scenario.txt file is to
    do a --resync, which establishes the baseline {...}.path1.lst and
    {...}.path2.lst files in the test working directory (.../workdir/
    relative to the temporary test directory). Various commands and
    listing snapshots are done within the test.
3.  Finally, the contents of the test working directory are compared to
    the contents of the testcase's golden directory.

Notes about testing

-   Test cases are in individual directories beneath
    ./cmd/bisync/testdata. A command line reference to a test is
    understood to reference a directory beneath testdata. For example,
    go test ./cmd/bisync -case dry-run -remote gdrive: -remote2 local
    refers to the test case in ./cmd/bisync/testdata/test_dry_run.
-   The test working directory is located at .../workdir relative to a
    temporary test directory, usually under /tmp on Linux.
-   The local test sync tree is created at a temporary directory named
    like bisync.XXX under system temporary directory.
-   The remote test sync tree is located at a temporary directory under
    <remote:>/bisync.XXX/.
-   path1 and/or path2 subdirectories are created in a temporary
    directory under the respective local or cloud test remote.
-   By default, the Path1 and Path2 test dirs and workdir will be
    deleted after each test run. The -no-cleanup flag disables purging
    these directories when validating and debugging a given test. These
    directories will be flushed before running another test, independent
    of the -no-cleanup usage.
-   You will likely want to add `-
    /testdir/to your normal   bisync--filters-fileso that normal syncs do not attempt to sync   the test temporary directories, which may haveRCLONE_TESTmiscompares   in some testcases which would otherwise trip the--check-accesssystem.   The--check-accessmechanism is hard-coded to ignoreRCLONE_TESTfiles beneathbisync/testdata`,
    so the test cases may reside on the synched tree even if there are
    check file mismatches in the test tree.
-   Some Dropbox tests can fail, notably printing the following message:
    src and dst identical but can't set mod time without deleting and re-uploading
    This is expected and happens due a way Dropbox handles modificaion
    times. You should use the -refresh-times test flag to make up for
    this.
-   If Dropbox tests hit request limit for you and print error message
    too_many_requests/...: Too many requests or write operations. then
    follow the Dropbox App ID instructions.

Updating golden results

Sometimes even a slight change in the bisync source can cause little
changes spread around many log files. Updating them manually would be a
nighmare.

The -golden flag will store the test.log and *.lst listings from each
test case into respective golden directories. Golden results will
automatically contain generic strings instead of local or cloud paths
which means that they should match when run with a different cloud
service.

Your normal workflow might be as follows: 1. Git-clone the rclone
sources locally 2. Modify bisync source and check that it builds 3. Run
the whole test suite go test ./cmd/bisync -remote local 4. If some tests
show log difference, recheck them individually, e.g.:
go test ./cmd/bisync -remote local -case basic 5. If you are convinced
with the difference, goldenize all tests at once:
go test ./cmd/bisync -remote local -golden 6. Use word diff:
git diff --word-diff ./cmd/bisync/testdata/. Please note that normal
line-level diff is generally useless here. 7. Check the difference
carefully! 8. Commit the change (git commit) only if you are sure. If
unsure, save your code changes then wipe the log diffs from git:
git reset [--hard].

Structure of test scenarios

-   <testname>/initial/ contains a tree of files that will be set as the
    initial condition on both Path1 and Path2 testdirs.
-   <testname>/modfiles/ contains files that will be used to modify the
    Path1 and/or Path2 filesystems.
-   <testname>/golden/ contains the expected content of the test working
    directory (workdir) at the completion of the testcase.
-   <testname>/scenario.txt contains the body of the test, in the form
    of various commands to modify files, run bisync, and snapshot
    listings. Output from these commands is captured to
    .../workdir/test.log for comparison to the golden files.

Supported test commands

-   test <some message> Print the line to the console and to the
    test.log: test sync is working correctly with options x, y, z
-   copy-listings <prefix> Save a copy of all .lst listings in the test
    working directory with the specified prefix:
    save-listings exclude-pass-run
-   move-listings <prefix> Similar to copy-listings but removes the
    source
-   purge-children <dir> This will delete all child files and purge all
    child subdirs under given directory but keep the parent intact. This
    behavior is important for tests with Google Drive because removing
    and re-creating the parent would change its ID.
-   delete-file <file> Delete a single file.
-   delete-glob <dir> <pattern> Delete a group of files located one
    level deep in the given directory with names maching a given glob
    pattern.
-   touch-glob YYYY-MM-DD <dir> <pattern> Change modification time on a
    group of files.
-   touch-copy YYYY-MM-DD <source-file> <dest-dir> Change file
    modification time then copy it to destination.
-   copy-file <source-file> <dest-dir> Copy a single file to given
    directory.
-   copy-as <source-file> <dest-file> Similar to above but destination
    must include both directory and the new file name at destination.
-   copy-dir <src> <dst> and sync-dir <src> <dst> Copy/sync a directory.
    Equivalent of rclone copy and rclone sync.
-   list-dirs <dir> Equivalent to rclone lsf -R --dirs-only <dir>
-   bisync [options] Runs bisync against -remote and -remote2.

Supported substitution terms

-   {testdir/} - the root dir of the testcase
-   {datadir/} - the modfiles dir under the testcase root
-   {workdir/} - the temporary test working directory
-   {path1/} - the root of the Path1 test directory tree
-   {path2/} - the root of the Path2 test directory tree
-   {session} - base name of the test listings
-   {/} - OS-specific path separator
-   {spc}, {tab}, {eol} - whitespace
-   {chr:HH} - raw byte with given hexadecimal code

Substitution results of the terms named like {dir/} will end with / (or
backslash on Windows), so it is not necessary to include slash in the
usage, for example delete-file {path1/}file1.txt.

Benchmarks

This section is work in progress.

Here are a few data points for scale, execution times, and memory usage.

The first set of data was taken between a local disk to Dropbox. The
speedtest.net download speed was ~170 Mbps, and upload speed was ~10
Mbps. 500 files (~9.5 MB each) had been already synched. 50 files were
added in a new directory, each ~9.5 MB, ~475 MB total.

  Delete local dir         Queued 50 deletes up: 9 sec         13 sec
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

This next data is from a user's application. They had ~400GB of data
over 1.96 million files being sync'ed between a Windows local disk and
some remote cloud. The file full path length was on average 35
characters (which factors into load time and RAM required).

-   Loading the prior listing into memory (1.96 million files, listing
    file size 140 MB) took ~30 sec and occupied about 1 GB of RAM.
-   Getting a fresh listing of the local file system (producing the 140
    MB output file) took about XXX sec.
-   Getting a fresh listing of the remote file system (producing the 140
    MB output file) took about XXX sec. The network download speed was
    measured at XXX Mb/s.
-   Once the prior and current Path1 and Path2 listings were loaded (a
    total of four to be loaded, two at a time), determining the deltas
    was pretty quick (a few seconds for this test case), and the
    transfer time for any files to be copied was dominated by the

rclone's bisync implementation was derived from the rclonesync-V2
project, including documentation and test mechanisms, with
[@cjnaz](https://github.com/cjnaz)'s full support and encouragement.

rclone bisync is similar in nature to a range of other projects:

-   unison
-   syncthing
-   cjnaz/rclonesync
-   ConorWilliams/rsinc
-   jwink3101/syncrclone
-   DavideRossi/upback

Bisync adopts the differential synchronization technique, which is based
on keeping history of changes performed by both synchronizing sides. See
the Dual Shadow Method section in the Neil Fraser's article.

Also note a number of academic publications by Benjamin Pierce about
Unison and synchronization in general.

1Fichier

This is a backend for the 1fichier cloud storage service. Note that a
Premium subscription is required to use the API.

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. remote:directory/subdirectory.

Configuration

The initial setup for 1Fichier involves getting the API key from the
website which you need to do in your browser.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / 1Fichier
       \ "fichier"
    [snip]
    Storage> fichier
    ** See help for fichier backend at: https://rclone.org/fichier/ **

    Your API Key, get it from https://1fichier.com/console/params.pl
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    api_key> example_key

    Edit advanced config? (y/n)
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> 
    Remote config
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = fichier
    api_key = example_key
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your 1Fichier account

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your 1Fichier account

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a 1Fichier directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Modified time and hashes

1Fichier does not support modification times. It supports the Whirlpool
hash algorithm.

Duplicated files

1Fichier can have two files with exactly the same name and path (unlike
a normal file system).

Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  \            0x5C        ＼
  <            0x3C        ＜
  >            0x3E        ＞
  "            0x22        ＂
  $            0x24        ＄
  `            0x60        ｀
  '            0x27        ＇

File names can also not start or end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the first or last character in the
name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

Limitations

rclone about is not supported by the 1Fichier backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use
policy mfs (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.

See List of backends that do not support rclone about See rclone about

Alias

The alias remote provides a new name for another remote.

Paths may be as deep as required or a local path, e.g.
remote:directory/subdirectory or /directory/subdirectory.

During the initial setup with rclone config you will specify the target
remote. The target remote can either be a local path or another remote.

Subfolders can be used in target remote. Assume an alias remote named
backup with the target mydrive:private/backup. Invoking
rclone mkdir backup:desktop is exactly the same as invoking
rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/desktop.

There will be no special handling of paths containing .. segments.
Invoking rclone mkdir backup:../desktop is exactly the same as invoking
rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/../desktop. The empty path is not
allowed as a remote. To alias the current directory use . instead.

Configuration

Here is an example of how to make an alias called remote for local
folder. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n

    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level in /mnt/storage/backup

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in /mnt/storage/backup

    rclone ls remote:

Copy another local directory to the alias directory called source

    rclone copy /home/source remote:source

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to alias (Alias for an existing
remote).

--alias-remote

Remote or path to alias.

Can be "myremote:path/to/dir", "myremote:bucket", "myremote:" or
"/local/path".

Amazon Drive

Amazon Drive, formerly known as Amazon Cloud Drive, is a cloud storage
service run by Amazon for consumers.

Status

Important: rclone supports Amazon Drive only if you have your own set of
API keys. Unfortunately the Amazon Drive developer program is now closed
to new entries so if you don't already have your own set of keys you
will not be able to use rclone with Amazon Drive.

For the history on why rclone no longer has a set of Amazon Drive API
keys see the forum.

If you happen to know anyone who works at Amazon then please ask them to
re-instate rclone into the Amazon Drive developer program - thanks!

Configuration

The initial setup for Amazon Drive involves getting a token from Amazon
which you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through
it.

The configuration process for Amazon Drive may involve using an oauth
proxy. This is used to keep the Amazon credentials out of the source
code. The proxy runs in Google's very secure App Engine environment and
doesn't store any credentials which pass through it.

Since rclone doesn't currently have its own Amazon Drive credentials so
you will either need to have your own client_id and client_secret with
Amazon Drive, or use a third-party oauth proxy in which case you will
need to enter client_id, client_secret, auth_url and token_url.

Note also if you are not using Amazon's auth_url and token_url, (ie you
filled in something for those) then if setting up on a remote machine
you can only use the copying the config method of configuration -
rclone authorize will not work.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/r/c/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value

    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [remote]
    client_id = your client ID goes here
    client_secret = your client secret goes here
    auth_url = Optional auth URL
    token_url = Optional token URL
    token = {"access_token":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","expiry":"2015-09-06T16:07:39.658438471+01:00"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Amazon. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is
on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to unblock it
temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your Amazon Drive

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Amazon Drive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Amazon Drive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Modified time and MD5SUMs

Amazon Drive doesn't allow modification times to be changed via the API
so these won't be accurate or used for syncing.

It does store MD5SUMs so for a more accurate sync, you can use the
--checksum flag.

Restricted filename characters

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  NUL          0x00         ␀
  /            0x2F        ／

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

Deleting files

Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash. Amazon don't
provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to empty the trash, so
you will have to do that with one of Amazon's apps or via the Amazon
Drive website. As of November 17, 2016, files are automatically deleted
by Amazon from the trash after 30 days.

Using with non .com Amazon accounts

Let's say you usually use amazon.co.uk. When you authenticate with
rclone it will take you to an amazon.com page to log in. Your
amazon.co.uk email and password should work here just fine.

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to amazon cloud drive (Amazon
Drive).

--acd-client-id

OAuth Client Id.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

-   Config: client_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_CLIENT_ID
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--acd-client-secret

OAuth Client Secret.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

-   Config: client_secret
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_CLIENT_SECRET
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to amazon cloud drive (Amazon
Drive).

--acd-token

OAuth Access Token as a JSON blob.

Properties:

-   Config: token
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_TOKEN
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--acd-auth-url

Auth server URL.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

Properties:

-   Config: auth_url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_AUTH_URL
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--acd-token-url

Token server url.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

Properties:

-   Config: token_url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_TOKEN_URL
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--acd-checkpoint

Checkpoint for internal polling (debug).

Properties:

-   Config: checkpoint
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_CHECKPOINT
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--acd-upload-wait-per-gb

Additional time per GiB to wait after a failed complete upload to see if
it appears.

Sometimes Amazon Drive gives an error when a file has been fully
uploaded but the file appears anyway after a little while. This happens
sometimes for files over 1 GiB in size and nearly every time for files
bigger than 10 GiB. This parameter controls the time rclone waits for
the file to appear.

The default value for this parameter is 3 minutes per GiB, so by default
it will wait 3 minutes for every GiB uploaded to see if the file
appears.

You can disable this feature by setting it to 0. This may cause conflict
errors as rclone retries the failed upload but the file will most likely
appear correctly eventually.

These values were determined empirically by observing lots of uploads of
big files for a range of file sizes.

Upload with the "-v" flag to see more info about what rclone is doing in
this situation.

Properties:

-   Config: upload_wait_per_gb
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_UPLOAD_WAIT_PER_GB
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 3m0s

--acd-templink-threshold

Files >= this size will be downloaded via their tempLink.

Files this size or more will be downloaded via their "tempLink". This is
to work around a problem with Amazon Drive which blocks downloads of
files bigger than about 10 GiB. The default for this is 9 GiB which
shouldn't need to be changed.

To download files above this threshold, rclone requests a "tempLink"
which downloads the file through a temporary URL directly from the
underlying S3 storage.

Properties:

-   Config: templink_threshold
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_TEMPLINK_THRESHOLD
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 9Gi

--acd-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: Slash,InvalidUtf8,Dot

Limitations

Note that Amazon Drive is case insensitive so you can't have a file
called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

Amazon Drive has rate limiting so you may notice errors in the sync (429
errors). rclone will automatically retry the sync up to 3 times by
default (see --retries flag) which should hopefully work around this
problem.

Amazon Drive has an internal limit of file sizes that can be uploaded to
the service. This limit is not officially published, but all files
larger than this will fail.

At the time of writing (Jan 2016) is in the area of 50 GiB per file.
This means that larger files are likely to fail.

Unfortunately there is no way for rclone to see that this failure is
because of file size, so it will retry the operation, as any other
failure. To avoid this problem, use --max-size 50000M option to limit
the maximum size of uploaded files. Note that --max-size does not split
files into segments, it only ignores files over this size.

rclone about is not supported by the Amazon Drive backend. Backends
without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount
or use policy mfs (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See List of backends that do not support rclone about See rclone about

Amazon S3 Storage Providers

The S3 backend can be used with a number of different providers:

-   AWS S3
-   Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) Object Storage System (OSS)
-   Ceph
-   DigitalOcean Spaces
-   Dreamhost
-   IBM COS S3
-   Minio
-   RackCorp Object Storage
-   Scaleway
-   Seagate Lyve Cloud
-   SeaweedFS
-   StackPath
-   Storj
-   Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS)
-   Wasabi

Paths are specified as remote:bucket (or remote: for the lsd command.)
You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. remote:bucket/path/to/dir.

Once you have made a remote (see the provider specific section above)
you can use it like this:

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:bucket

Configuration

Here is an example of making an s3 configuration for the AWS S3
provider. Most applies to the other providers as well, any differences
are described below.

Modified time

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
X-Amz-Meta-Mtime as floating point since the epoch, accurate to 1 ns.

If the modification time needs to be updated rclone will attempt to
perform a server side copy to update the modification if the object can
be copied in a single part. In the case the object is larger than 5Gb or
is in Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive storage the object will be
uploaded rather than copied.

Note that reading this from the object takes an additional HEAD request
as the metadata isn't returned in object listings.

Reducing costs

Avoiding HEAD requests to read the modification time

By default, rclone will use the modification time of objects stored in
S3 for syncing. This is stored in object metadata which unfortunately
takes an extra HEAD request to read which can be expensive (in time and
money).

The modification time is used by default for all operations that require
checking the time a file was last updated. It allows rclone to treat the
remote more like a true filesystem, but it is inefficient on S3 because
it requires an extra API call to retrieve the metadata.

The extra API calls can be avoided when syncing (using rclone sync or
rclone copy) in a few different ways, each with its own tradeoffs.

-   --size-only
    -   Only checks the size of files.
    -   Uses no extra transactions.
    -   If the file doesn't change size then rclone won't detect it has
        changed.
    -   rclone sync --size-only /path/to/source s3:bucket
-   --checksum
    -   Checks the size and MD5 checksum of files.
    -   Uses no extra transactions.
    -   The most accurate detection of changes possible.
    -   Will cause the source to read an MD5 checksum which, if it is a
        local disk, will cause lots of disk activity.
    -   If the source and destination are both S3 this is the
        recommended flag to use for maximum efficiency.
    -   rclone sync --checksum /path/to/source s3:bucket
-   --update --use-server-modtime
    -   Uses no extra transactions.
    -   Modification time becomes the time the object was uploaded.
    -   For many operations this is sufficient to determine if it needs
        uploading.
    -   Using --update along with --use-server-modtime, avoids the extra
        API call and uploads files whose local modification time is
        newer than the time it was last uploaded.
    -   Files created with timestamps in the past will be missed by the
        sync.
    -   rclone sync --update --use-server-modtime /path/to/source s3:bucket

These flags can and should be used in combination with --fast-list - see
below.

If using rclone mount or any command using the VFS (eg rclone serve)
commands then you might want to consider using the VFS flag --no-modtime
which will stop rclone reading the modification time for every object.
You could also use --use-server-modtime if you are happy with the
modification times of the objects being the time of upload.

Avoiding GET requests to read directory listings

Rclone's default directory traversal is to process each directory
individually. This takes one API call per directory. Using the
--fast-list flag will read all info about the the objects into memory
first using a smaller number of API calls (one per 1000 objects). See
the rclone docs for more details.

    rclone sync --fast-list --checksum /path/to/source s3:bucket

--fast-list trades off API transactions for memory use. As a rough guide
rclone uses 1k of memory per object stored, so using --fast-list on a
sync of a million objects will use roughly 1 GiB of RAM.

If you are only copying a small number of files into a big repository
then using --no-traverse is a good idea. This finds objects directly
instead of through directory listings. You can do a "top-up" sync very
cheaply by using --max-age and --no-traverse to copy only recent files,
eg

    rclone copy --max-age 24h --no-traverse /path/to/source s3:bucket

You'd then do a full rclone sync less often.

Note that --fast-list isn't required in the top-up sync.

Avoiding HEAD requests after PUT

By default, rclone will HEAD every object it uploads. It does this to
check the object got uploaded correctly.

You can disable this with the --s3-no-head option - see there for more
details.

Setting this flag increases the chance for undetected upload failures.

Hashes

For small objects which weren't uploaded as multipart uploads (objects
sized below --s3-upload-cutoff if uploaded with rclone) rclone uses the
ETag: header as an MD5 checksum.

However for objects which were uploaded as multipart uploads or with
server side encryption (SSE-AWS or SSE-C) the ETag header is no longer
the MD5 sum of the data, so rclone adds an additional piece of metadata
X-Amz-Meta-Md5chksum which is a base64 encoded MD5 hash (in the same
format as is required for Content-MD5).

For large objects, calculating this hash can take some time so the
addition of this hash can be disabled with --s3-disable-checksum. This
will mean that these objects do not have an MD5 checksum.

Note that reading this from the object takes an additional HEAD request
as the metadata isn't returned in object listings.

Cleanup

If you run rclone cleanup s3:bucket then it will remove all pending
multipart uploads older than 24 hours. You can use the -i flag to see
exactly what it will do. If you want more control over the expiry date
then run rclone backend cleanup s3:bucket -o max-age=1h to expire all
uploads older than one hour. You can use
rclone backend list-multipart-uploads s3:bucket to see the pending
multipart uploads.

Restricted filename characters

S3 allows any valid UTF-8 string as a key.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be replaced, as they can't be used in XML.

The following characters are replaced since these are problematic when
dealing with the REST API:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  NUL          0x00         ␀
  /            0x2F        ／

The encoding will also encode these file names as they don't seem to
work with the SDK properly:

  File name    Replacement
  ----------- -------------
  .                ．
  ..              ．．

Multipart uploads

rclone supports multipart uploads with S3 which means that it can upload
files bigger than 5 GiB.

Note that files uploaded both with multipart upload and through crypt
remotes do not have MD5 sums.

rclone switches from single part uploads to multipart uploads at the
point specified by --s3-upload-cutoff. This can be a maximum of 5 GiB
and a minimum of 0 (ie always upload multipart files).

The chunk sizes used in the multipart upload are specified by
--s3-chunk-size and the number of chunks uploaded concurrently is
specified by --s3-upload-concurrency.

Multipart uploads will use --transfers * --s3-upload-concurrency *
--s3-chunk-size extra memory. Single part uploads to not use extra
memory.

Single part transfers can be faster than multipart transfers or slower
depending on your latency from S3 - the more latency, the more likely
single part transfers will be faster.

Increasing --s3-upload-concurrency will increase throughput (8 would be
a sensible value) and increasing --s3-chunk-size also increases
throughput (16M would be sensible). Increasing either of these will use
more memory. The default values are high enough to gain most of the
possible performance without using too much memory.

Buckets and Regions

With Amazon S3 you can list buckets (rclone lsd) using any region, but
you can only access the content of a bucket from the region it was
created in. If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong region, you
will get an error, incorrect region, the bucket is not in 'XXX' region.

Authentication

There are a number of ways to supply rclone with a set of AWS
credentials, with and without using the environment.

The different authentication methods are tried in this order:

-   Directly in the rclone configuration file (env_auth = false in the
    config file):
    -   access_key_id and secret_access_key are required.
    -   session_token can be optionally set when using AWS STS.
-   Runtime configuration (env_auth = true in the config file):
    -   Export the following environment variables before running
        rclone:
        -   Access Key ID: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID or AWS_ACCESS_KEY
        -   Secret Access Key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY or AWS_SECRET_KEY
        -   Session Token: AWS_SESSION_TOKEN (optional)
    -   Or, use a named profile:
        -   Profile files are standard files used by AWS CLI tools
        -   By default it will use the profile in your home directory
            (e.g. ~/.aws/credentials on unix based systems) file and the
            "default" profile, to change set these environment
            variables:
            -   AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE to control which file.
            -   AWS_PROFILE to control which profile to use.
    -   Or, run rclone in an ECS task with an IAM role (AWS only).
    -   Or, run rclone on an EC2 instance with an IAM role (AWS only).
    -   Or, run rclone in an EKS pod with an IAM role that is associated
        with a service account (AWS only).

If none of these option actually end up providing rclone with AWS
credentials then S3 interaction will be non-authenticated (see below).

S3 Permissions

When using the sync subcommand of rclone the following minimum
permissions are required to be available on the bucket being written to:

-   ListBucket
-   DeleteObject
-   GetObject
-   PutObject
-   PutObjectACL

When using the lsd subcommand, the ListAllMyBuckets permission is
required.

Example policy:

    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::USER_SID:user/USER_NAME"
                },
                "Action": [
                    "s3:ListBucket",
                    "s3:DeleteObject",
                    "s3:GetObject",
                    "s3:PutObject",
                    "s3:PutObjectAcl"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                  "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*",
                  "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME"
                ]
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
            }
        ]
    }

Notes on above:

1.  This is a policy that can be used when creating bucket. It assumes
    that USER_NAME has been created.
2.  The Resource entry must include both resource ARNs, as one implies
    the bucket and the other implies the bucket's objects.

For reference, here's an Ansible script that will generate one or more
buckets that will work with rclone sync.

Key Management System (KMS)

If you are using server-side encryption with KMS then you must make sure
rclone is configured with server_side_encryption = aws:kms otherwise you
will find you can't transfer small objects - these will create checksum
errors.

Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive

You can upload objects using the glacier storage class or transition
them to glacier using a lifecycle policy. The bucket can still be synced
or copied into normally, but if rclone tries to access data from the
glacier storage class you will see an error like below.

    2017/09/11 19:07:43 Failed to sync: failed to open source object: Object in GLACIER, restore first: path/to/file

In this case you need to restore the object(s) in question before using
rclone.

Note that rclone only speaks the S3 API it does not speak the Glacier
Vault API, so rclone cannot directly access Glacier Vaults.

Object-lock enabled S3 bucket

According to AWS's documentation on S3 Object Lock:

  If you configure a default retention period on a bucket, requests to
  upload objects in such a bucket must include the Content-MD5 header.

As mentioned in the Hashes section, small files that are not uploaded as
multipart, use a different tag, causing the upload to fail. A simple
solution is to set the --s3-upload-cutoff 0 and force all the files to
be uploaded as multipart.

Enables requester pays option when interacting with S3 bucket.

Properties:

-   Config: requester_pays
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_REQUESTER_PAYS
-   Provider: AWS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--s3-sse-customer-algorithm

If using SSE-C, the server-side encryption algorithm used when storing
this object in S3.

Properties:

-   Config: sse_customer_algorithm
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_SSE_CUSTOMER_ALGORITHM
-   Provider: AWS,Ceph,Minio
-   Type: string
-   Required: false
-   Examples:
    -   ""
        -   None
    -   "AES256"
        -   AES256

--s3-sse-customer-key

If using SSE-C you must provide the secret encryption key used to
encrypt/decrypt your data.

Properties:

-   Config: sse_customer_key
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_SSE_CUSTOMER_KEY
-   Provider: AWS,Ceph,Minio
-   Type: string
-   Required: false
-   Examples:
    -   ""
        -   None

--s3-sse-customer-key-md5

If using SSE-C you may provide the secret encryption key MD5 checksum
(optional).

If you leave it blank, this is calculated automatically from the
sse_customer_key provided.

Properties:

-   Config: sse_customer_key_md5
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_SSE_CUSTOMER_KEY_MD5
-   Provider: AWS,Ceph,Minio
-   Type: string
-   Required: false
-   Examples:
    -   ""
        -   None

--s3-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload.

Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of chunk_size. The
minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.

Properties:

-   Config: upload_cutoff
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 200Mi

--s3-chunk-size

Chunk size to use for uploading.

When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff or files with unknown
size (e.g. from "rclone rcat" or uploaded with "rclone mount" or google
photos or google docs) they will be uploaded as multipart uploads using
this chunk size.

Note that "--s3-upload-concurrency" chunks of this size are buffered in
memory per transfer.

If you are transferring large files over high-speed links and you have
enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.

Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a large
file of known size to stay below the 10,000 chunks limit.

Files of unknown size are uploaded with the configured chunk_size. Since
the default chunk size is 5 MiB and there can be at most 10,000 chunks,
this means that by default the maximum size of a file you can stream
upload is 48 GiB. If you wish to stream upload larger files then you
will need to increase chunk_size.

Properties:

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 5Mi

--s3-max-upload-parts

Maximum number of parts in a multipart upload.

This option defines the maximum number of multipart chunks to use when
doing a multipart upload.

This can be useful if a service does not support the AWS S3
specification of 10,000 chunks.

Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a large
file of a known size to stay below this number of chunks limit.

Properties:

-   Config: max_upload_parts
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_MAX_UPLOAD_PARTS
-   Type: int
-   Default: 10000

--s3-copy-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to multipart copy.

Any files larger than this that need to be server-side copied will be
copied in chunks of this size.

The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.

Properties:

-   Config: copy_cutoff
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_COPY_CUTOFF
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 4.656Gi

--s3-disable-checksum

Don't store MD5 checksum with object metadata.

Normally rclone will calculate the MD5 checksum of the input before
uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great
for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files to
start uploading.

Properties:

-   Config: disable_checksum
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_DISABLE_CHECKSUM
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--s3-shared-credentials-file

Path to the shared credentials file.

If env_auth = true then rclone can use a shared credentials file.

If this variable is empty rclone will look for the
"AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE" env variable. If the env value is empty it
will default to the current user's home directory.

    Linux/OSX: "$HOME/.aws/credentials"
    Windows:   "%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials"

Properties:

-   Config: shared_credentials_file
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--s3-profile

Profile to use in the shared credentials file.

If env_auth = true then rclone can use a shared credentials file. This
variable controls which profile is used in that file.

If empty it will default to the environment variable "AWS_PROFILE" or
"default" if that environment variable is also not set.

Properties:

-   Config: profile
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_PROFILE
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--s3-session-token

An AWS session token.

Properties:

-   Config: session_token
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_SESSION_TOKEN
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--s3-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently.

If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links
and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing
this may help to speed up the transfers.

Properties:

-   Config: upload_concurrency
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
-   Type: int
-   Default: 4

--s3-force-path-style

If true use path style access if false use virtual hosted style.

If this is true (the default) then rclone will use path style access, if
false then rclone will use virtual path style. See the AWS S3 docs for
more info.

Some providers (e.g. AWS, Aliyun OSS, Netease COS, or Tencent COS)
require this set to false - rclone will do this automatically based on
the provider setting.

Properties:

-   Config: force_path_style
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: true

--s3-v2-auth

If true use v2 authentication.

If this is false (the default) then rclone will use v4 authentication.
If it is set then rclone will use v2 authentication.

Use this only if v4 signatures don't work, e.g. pre Jewel/v10 CEPH.

Properties:

-   Config: v2_auth
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_V2_AUTH
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--s3-use-accelerate-endpoint

If true use the AWS S3 accelerated endpoint.

See: AWS S3 Transfer acceleration

Properties:

-   Config: use_accelerate_endpoint
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_USE_ACCELERATE_ENDPOINT
-   Provider: AWS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--s3-leave-parts-on-error

If true avoid calling abort upload on a failure, leaving all
successfully uploaded parts on S3 for manual recovery.

It should be set to true for resuming uploads across different sessions.

WARNING: Storing parts of an incomplete multipart upload counts towards
space usage on S3 and will add additional costs if not cleaned up.

Properties:

-   Config: leave_parts_on_error
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_LEAVE_PARTS_ON_ERROR
-   Provider: AWS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--s3-list-chunk

Size of listing chunk (response list for each ListObject S3 request).

This option is also known as "MaxKeys", "max-items", or "page-size" from
the AWS S3 specification. Most services truncate the response list to
1000 objects even if requested more than that. In AWS S3 this is a
global maximum and cannot be changed, see AWS S3. In Ceph, this can be
increased with the "rgw list buckets max chunk" option.

Properties:

-   Config: list_chunk
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_LIST_CHUNK
-   Type: int
-   Default: 1000

--s3-list-version

Version of ListObjects to use: 1,2 or 0 for auto.

When S3 originally launched it only provided the ListObjects call to
enumerate objects in a bucket.

However in May 2016 the ListObjectsV2 call was introduced. This is much
higher performance and should be used if at all possible.

If set to the default, 0, rclone will guess according to the provider
set which list objects method to call. If it guesses wrong, then it may
be set manually here.

Properties:

-   Config: list_version
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_LIST_VERSION
-   Type: int
-   Default: 0

--s3-list-url-encode

Whether to url encode listings: true/false/unset

Some providers support URL encoding listings and where this is available
this is more reliable when using control characters in file names. If
this is set to unset (the default) then rclone will choose according to
the provider setting what to apply, but you can override rclone's choice
here.

Properties:

-   Config: list_url_encode
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_LIST_URL_ENCODE
-   Type: Tristate
-   Default: unset

--s3-no-check-bucket

If set, don't attempt to check the bucket exists or create it.

This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions
rclone does if you know the bucket exists already.

It can also be needed if the user you are using does not have bucket
creation permissions. Before v1.52.0 this would have passed silently due
to a bug.

Properties:

-   Config: no_check_bucket
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_NO_CHECK_BUCKET
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--s3-no-head

If set, don't HEAD uploaded objects to check integrity.

This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions
rclone does.

Setting it means that if rclone receives a 200 OK message after
uploading an object with PUT then it will assume that it got uploaded
properly.

In particular it will assume:

-   the metadata, including modtime, storage class and content type was
    as uploaded
-   the size was as uploaded

It reads the following items from the response for a single part PUT:

-   the MD5SUM
-   The uploaded date

For multipart uploads these items aren't read.

If an source object of unknown length is uploaded then rclone will do a
HEAD request.

Setting this flag increases the chance for undetected upload failures,
in particular an incorrect size, so it isn't recommended for normal
operation. In practice the chance of an undetected upload failure is
very small even with this flag.

Properties:

-   Config: no_head
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_NO_HEAD
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--s3-no-head-object

If set, do not do HEAD before GET when getting objects.

Properties:

-   Config: no_head_object
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_NO_HEAD_OBJECT
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--s3-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: Slash,InvalidUtf8,Dot

--s3-memory-pool-flush-time

How often internal memory buffer pools will be flushed.

Uploads which requires additional buffers (f.e multipart) will use
memory pool for allocations. This option controls how often unused
buffers will be removed from the pool.

Properties:

-   Config: memory_pool_flush_time
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_MEMORY_POOL_FLUSH_TIME
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 1m0s

--s3-memory-pool-use-mmap

Whether to use mmap buffers in internal memory pool.

Properties:

-   Config: memory_pool_use_mmap
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_MEMORY_POOL_USE_MMAP
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--s3-disable-http2

Disable usage of http2 for S3 backends.

There is currently an unsolved issue with the s3 (specifically minio)
backend and HTTP/2. HTTP/2 is enabled by default for the s3 backend but
can be disabled here. When the issue is solved this flag will be
removed.

See: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4673,
https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3631

Properties:

-   Config: disable_http2
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_DISABLE_HTTP2
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--s3-download-url

Custom endpoint for downloads. This is usually set to a CloudFront CDN
URL as AWS S3 offers cheaper egress for data downloaded through the
CloudFront network.

Properties:

-   Config: download_url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_DOWNLOAD_URL
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--s3-use-multipart-etag

Whether to use ETag in multipart uploads for verification

This should be true, false or left unset to use the default for the
provider.

Properties:

-   Config: use_multipart_etag
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_USE_MULTIPART_ETAG
-   Type: Tristate
-   Default: unset

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the "rclone backend" command for more info on how to pass options
and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
backend/command.

restore

Restore objects from GLACIER to normal storage

    rclone backend restore remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command can be used to restore one or more objects from GLACIER to
normal storage.

Usage Examples:

    rclone backend restore s3:bucket/path/to/object [-o priority=PRIORITY] [-o lifetime=DAYS]
    rclone backend restore s3:bucket/path/to/directory [-o priority=PRIORITY] [-o lifetime=DAYS]
    rclone backend restore s3:bucket [-o priority=PRIORITY] [-o lifetime=DAYS]

This flag also obeys the filters. Test first with -i/--interactive or
--dry-run flags

    rclone -i backend restore --include "*.txt" s3:bucket/path -o priority=Standard

All the objects shown will be marked for restore, then

    rclone backend restore --include "*.txt" s3:bucket/path -o priority=Standard

It returns a list of status dictionaries with Remote and Status keys.
The Status will be OK if it was successful or an error message if not.

    [
        {
            "Status": "OK",
            "Path": "test.txt"
        },
        {
            "Status": "OK",
            "Path": "test/file4.txt"
        }
    ]

Options:

-   "description": The optional description for the job.
-   "lifetime": Lifetime of the active copy in days
-   "priority": Priority of restore: Standard|Expedited|Bulk

list-multipart-uploads

List the unfinished multipart uploads

    rclone backend list-multipart-uploads remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command lists the unfinished multipart uploads in JSON format.

    rclone backend list-multipart s3:bucket/path/to/object

It returns a dictionary of buckets with values as lists of unfinished
multipart uploads.

You can call it with no bucket in which case it lists all bucket, with a
bucket or with a bucket and path.

    {
      "rclone": [
        {
          "Initiated": "2020-06-26T14:20:36Z",
          "Initiator": {
            "DisplayName": "XXX",
            "ID": "arn:aws:iam::XXX:user/XXX"
          },
          "Key": "KEY",
          "Owner": {
            "DisplayName": null,
            "ID": "XXX"
          },
          "StorageClass": "STANDARD",
          "UploadId": "XXX"
        }
      ],
      "rclone-1000files": [],
      "rclone-dst": []
    }

cleanup

Remove unfinished multipart uploads.

    rclone backend cleanup remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command removes unfinished multipart uploads of age greater than
max-age which defaults to 24 hours.

Note that you can use -i/--dry-run with this command to see what it
would do.

    rclone backend cleanup s3:bucket/path/to/object
    rclone backend cleanup -o max-age=7w s3:bucket/path/to/object

Durations are parsed as per the rest of rclone, 2h, 7d, 7w etc.

Options:

-   "max-age": Max age of upload to delete

Anonymous access to public buckets

If you want to use rclone to access a public bucket, configure with a
blank access_key_id and secret_access_key. Your config should end up
looking like this:

    [anons3]
    type = s3
    provider = AWS
    env_auth = false
    access_key_id =
    secret_access_key =
    region = us-east-1
    endpoint =
    location_constraint =
    acl = private
    server_side_encryption =
    storage_class =

Then use it as normal with the name of the public bucket, e.g.

    rclone lsd anons3:1000genomes

You will be able to list and copy data but not upload it.

Providers

AWS S3

This is the provider used as main example and described in the
configuration section above.

AWS Snowball Edge

AWS Snowball is a hardware appliance used for transferring bulk data
back to AWS. Its main software interface is S3 object storage.

To use rclone with AWS Snowball Edge devices, configure as standard for
an 'S3 Compatible Service' be sure to set upload_cutoff = 0 otherwise
you will run into authentication header issues as the snowball device
does not support query parameter based authentication.

eg.

    [snowball]
    type = s3
    provider = Other
    access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    endpoint = http://[IP of Snowball]:8080
    upload_cutoff = 0

Ceph

Ceph is an open-source, unified, distributed storage system designed for
excellent performance, reliability and scalability. It has an S3
compatible object storage interface.

To use rclone with Ceph, configure as above but leave the region blank
and set the endpoint. You should end up with something like this in your
config:

    [ceph]
    type = s3
    provider = Ceph
    env_auth = false
    access_key_id = XXX
    secret_access_key = YYY
    region =
    endpoint = https://ceph.endpoint.example.com
    location_constraint =
    acl =
    server_side_encryption =
    storage_class =

If you are using an older version of CEPH, e.g. 10.2.x Jewel, then you
may need to supply the parameter --s3-upload-cutoff 0 or put this in the
config file as upload_cutoff 0 to work around a bug which causes
uploading of small files to fail.

Note also that Ceph sometimes puts / in the passwords it gives users. If
you read the secret access key using the command line tools you will get
a JSON blob with the / escaped as \/. Make sure you only write / in the
secret access key.

Eg the dump from Ceph looks something like this (irrelevant keys
removed).

    {
        "user_id": "xxx",
        "display_name": "xxxx",
        "keys": [
            {
                "user": "xxx",
                "access_key": "xxxxxx",
                "secret_key": "xxxxxx\/xxxx"
            }
        ],
    }

Because this is a json dump, it is encoding the / as \/, so if you use
the secret key as xxxxxx/xxxx it will work fine.

Dreamhost

Dreamhost DreamObjects is an object storage system based on CEPH.

To use rclone with Dreamhost, configure as above but leave the region
blank and set the endpoint. You should end up with something like this
in your config:

    [dreamobjects]
    type = s3
    provider = DreamHost
    env_auth = false
    access_key_id = your_access_key
    secret_access_key = your_secret_key
    region =
    endpoint = objects-us-west-1.dream.io
    location_constraint =
    acl = private
    server_side_encryption =
    storage_class =

DigitalOcean Spaces

Spaces is an S3-interoperable object storage service from cloud provider
DigitalOcean.

To connect to DigitalOcean Spaces you will need an access key and secret
key. These can be retrieved on the "Applications & API" page of the
DigitalOcean control panel. They will be needed when prompted by
rclone config for your access_key_id and secret_access_key.

When prompted for a region or location_constraint, press enter to use
the default value. The region must be included in the endpoint setting
(e.g. nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com). The default values can be used for
other settings.

Going through the whole process of creating a new remote by running
rclone config, each prompt should be answered as shown below:

    Storage> s3
    env_auth> 1
    access_key_id> YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    secret_access_key> YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    region>
    endpoint> nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
    location_constraint>
    acl>
    storage_class>

The resulting configuration file should look like:

    [spaces]
    type = s3
    provider = DigitalOcean
    env_auth = false
    access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    region =
    endpoint = nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
    location_constraint =
    acl =
    server_side_encryption =
    storage_class =

Once configured, you can create a new Space and begin copying files. For
example:

    rclone mkdir spaces:my-new-space
    rclone copy /path/to/files spaces:my-new-space

IBM COS (S3)

        6)  Delete a file on remote.
            rclone delete IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket/file.txt

Minio

Minio is an object storage server built for cloud application developers
and devops.

It is very easy to install and provides an S3 compatible server which
can be used by rclone.

To use it, install Minio following the instructions here.

When it configures itself Minio will print something like this

    Endpoint:  http://192.168.1.106:9000  http://172.23.0.1:9000
    AccessKey: USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
    SecretKey: MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
    Region:    us-east-1
    SQS ARNs:  arn:minio:sqs:us-east-1:1:redis arn:minio:sqs:us-east-1:2:redis

    Browser Access:
       http://192.168.1.106:9000  http://172.23.0.1:9000

    Command-line Access: https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide
       $ mc config host add myminio http://192.168.1.106:9000 USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03

    Object API (Amazon S3 compatible):
       Go:         https://docs.minio.io/docs/golang-client-quickstart-guide
       Java:       https://docs.minio.io/docs/java-client-quickstart-guide
       Python:     https://docs.minio.io/docs/python-client-quickstart-guide
       JavaScript: https://docs.minio.io/docs/javascript-client-quickstart-guide
       .NET:       https://docs.minio.io/docs/dotnet-client-quickstart-guide

    Drive Capacity: 26 GiB Free, 165 GiB Total

These details need to go into rclone config like this. Note that it is
important to put the region in as stated above.

    env_auth> 1
    access_key_id> USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
    secret_access_key> MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
    region> us-east-1
    endpoint> http://192.168.1.106:9000
    location_constraint>
    server_side_encryption>

Which makes the config file look like this

    [minio]
    type = s3
    provider = Minio
    env_auth = false
    access_key_id = USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
    secret_access_key = MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
    region = us-east-1
    endpoint = http://192.168.1.106:9000
    location_constraint =
    server_side_encryption =

So once set up, for example, to copy files into a bucket

    rclone copy /path/to/files minio:bucket

RackCorp

RackCorp Object Storage is an S3 compatible object storage platform from
your friendly cloud provider RackCorp. The service is fast, reliable,
well priced and located in many strategic locations unserviced by
others, to ensure you can maintain data sovereignty.

Before you can use RackCorp Object Storage, you'll need to "sign up" for
an account on our "portal". Next you can create an access key, a
secret key and buckets, in your location of choice with ease. These
details are required for the next steps of configuration, when
rclone config asks for your access_key_id and secret_access_key.

Your config should end up looking a bit like this:

    [RCS3-demo-config]
    type = s3
    provider = RackCorp
    env_auth = true
    access_key_id = YOURACCESSKEY
    secret_access_key = YOURSECRETACCESSKEY
    region = au-nsw
    endpoint = s3.rackcorp.com
    location_constraint = au-nsw

Scaleway

Scaleway The Object Storage platform allows you to store anything from
backups, logs and web assets to documents and photos. Files can be
dropped from the Scaleway console or transferred through our API and CLI
or using any S3-compatible tool.

Scaleway provides an S3 interface which can be configured for use with
rclone like this:

    [scaleway]
    type = s3
    provider = Scaleway
    env_auth = false
    endpoint = s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
    access_key_id = SCWXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    secret_access_key = 1111111-2222-3333-44444-55555555555555
    region = nl-ams
    location_constraint =
    acl = private
    server_side_encryption =
    storage_class =

Seagate Lyve Cloud

Seagate Lyve Cloud is an S3 compatible object storage platform from
Seagate intended for enterprise use.

Here is a config run through for a remote called remote - you may choose
a different name of course. Note that to create an access key and secret
key you will need to create a service account first.

    $ rclone config
    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n

And the config file should end up looking like this:

    [remote]
    type = s3

    access_key_id = XXX
    secret_access_key = YYY
    endpoint = s3.us-east-1.lyvecloud.seagate.com

SeaweedFS

SeaweedFS is a distributed storage system for blobs, objects, files, and
data lake, with O(1) disk seek and a scalable file metadata store. It
has an S3 compatible object storage interface. SeaweedFS can also act as
a gateway to remote S3 compatible object store to cache data and
metadata with asynchronous write back, for fast local speed and minimize
access cost.

Assuming the SeaweedFS are configured with weed shell as such:

    > s3.bucket.create -name foo
    > s3.configure -access_key=any -secret_key=any -buckets=foo -user=me -actions=Read,Write,List,Tagging,Admin -apply
    {
      "identities": [
        {
          "name": "me",
          "credentials": [
            {
              "accessKey": "any",
              "secretKey": "any"
            }
          ],
          "actions": [
            "Read:foo",
            "Write:foo",
            "List:foo",
            "Tagging:foo",
            "Admin:foo"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

To use rclone with SeaweedFS, above configuration should end up with
something like this in your config:

    [seaweedfs_s3]
    type = s3
    provider = SeaweedFS
    access_key_id = any
    secret_access_key = any
    endpoint = localhost:8333

So once set up, for example to copy files into a bucket

    rclone copy /path/to/files seaweedfs_s3:foo

Wasabi

Wasabi is a cloud-based object storage service for a broad range of
applications and use cases. Wasabi is designed for individuals and
organizations that require a high-performance, reliable, and secure data

Storj

Storj is a decentralized cloud storage which can be used through its
native protocol or an S3 compatible gateway.

The S3 compatible gateway is configured using rclone config with a type
of s3 and with a provider name of Storj. Here is an example run of the
configurator.

    endpoint> 1 (as shown when creating the access grant)
    Edit advanced config?
    y) Yes
    n) No (default)
    y/n> n

Note that s3 credentials are generated when you create an access grant.

Backend quirks

-   --chunk-size is forced to be 64 MiB or greater. This will use more
    memory than the default of 5 MiB.
-   Server side copy is disabled as it isn't currently supported in the
    gateway.
-   GetTier and SetTier are not supported.

Backend bugs

Due to issue #39 uploading multipart files via the S3 gateway causes
them to lose their metadata. For rclone's purpose this means that the
modification time is not stored, nor is any MD5SUM (if one is available
from the source).

This has the following consequences:

-   Using rclone rcat will fail as the medatada doesn't match after
    upload
-   Uploading files with rclone mount will fail for the same reason
    -   This can worked around by using --vfs-cache-mode writes or
        --vfs-cache-mode full or setting --s3-upload-cutoff large
-   Files uploaded via a multipart upload won't have their modtimes
    -   This will mean that rclone sync will likely keep trying to
        upload files bigger than --s3-upload-cutoff
    -   This can be worked around with --checksum or --size-only or
        setting --s3-upload-cutoff large
    -   The maximum value for --s3-upload-cutoff is 5GiB though

One general purpose workaround is to set --s3-upload-cutoff 5G. This
means that rclone will upload files smaller than 5GiB as single parts.
Note that this can be set in the config file with upload_cutoff = 5G or
configured in the advanced settings. If you regularly transfer files
larger than 5G then using --checksum or --size-only in rclone sync is
the recommended workaround.

Comparison with the native protocol

Use the the native protocol to take advantage of client-side encryption
as well as to achieve the best possible download performance. Uploads
will be erasure-coded locally, thus a 1gb upload will result in 2.68gb
of data being uploaded to storage nodes across the network.

Use this backend and the S3 compatible Hosted Gateway to increase upload
performance and reduce the load on your systems and network. Uploads
will be encrypted and erasure-coded server-side, thus a 1GB upload will
result in only in 1GB of data being uploaded to storage nodes across the
network.

For more detailed comparison please check the documentation of the storj
backend.

Limitations

rclone about is not supported by the S3 backend. Backends without this
capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy
mfs (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.

See List of backends that do not support rclone about See rclone about

Backblaze B2

B2 is Backblaze's cloud storage system.

Paths are specified as remote:bucket (or remote: for the lsd command.)
You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. remote:bucket/path/to/dir.

Configuration

Here is an example of making a b2 configuration. First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process. To
authenticate you will either need your Account ID (a short hex number)
and Master Application Key (a long hex number) OR an Application Key,
which is the recommended method. See below for further details on
generating and using an Application Key.

    endpoint =
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

This remote is called remote and can now be used like this

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Create a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:bucket

Application Keys

B2 supports multiple Application Keys for different access permission to
B2 Buckets.

You can use these with rclone too; you will need to use rclone version
1.43 or later.

Follow Backblaze's docs to create an Application Key with the required
permission and add the applicationKeyId as the account and the
Application Key itself as the key.

Note that you must put the applicationKeyId as the account – you can't
use the master Account ID. If you try then B2 will return 401 errors.

--fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

Modified time

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
X-Bz-Info-src_last_modified_millis as milliseconds since 1970-01-01 in
the Backblaze standard. Other tools should be able to use this as a
modified time.

Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported. Note that if
a modification time needs to be updated on an object then it will create
a new version of the object.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  \            0x5C        ＼

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

Note that in 2020-05 Backblaze started allowing  characters in file
names. Rclone hasn't changed its encoding as this could cause syncs to
re-transfer files. If you want rclone not to replace  then see the
--b2-encoding flag below and remove the BackSlash from the string. This
can be set in the config.

SHA1 checksums

The SHA1 checksums of the files are checked on upload and download and
will be used in the syncing process.

Large files (bigger than the limit in --b2-upload-cutoff) which are
uploaded in chunks will store their SHA1 on the object as
X-Bz-Info-large_file_sha1 as recommended by Backblaze.

For a large file to be uploaded with an SHA1 checksum, the source needs
to support SHA1 checksums. The local disk supports SHA1 checksums so
large file transfers from local disk will have an SHA1. See the overview
for exactly which remotes support SHA1.

Sources which don't support SHA1, in particular crypt will upload large
files without SHA1 checksums. This may be fixed in the future (see
#1767).

Files sizes below --b2-upload-cutoff will always have an SHA1 regardless
of the source.

Transfers

Backblaze recommends that you do lots of transfers simultaneously for
maximum speed. In tests from my SSD equipped laptop the optimum setting
is about --transfers 32 though higher numbers may be used for a slight
speed improvement. The optimum number for you may vary depending on your
hardware, how big the files are, how much you want to load your
computer, etc. The default of --transfers 4 is definitely too low for
Backblaze B2 though.

Note that uploading big files (bigger than 200 MiB by default) will use
a 96 MiB RAM buffer by default. There can be at most --transfers of
these in use at any moment, so this sets the upper limit on the memory
used.

Versions

When rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a new version of
it. Likewise when you delete a file, the old version will be marked
hidden and still be available. Conversely, you may opt in to a "hard
delete" of files with the --b2-hard-delete flag which would permanently
remove the file instead of hiding it.

Old versions of files, where available, are visible using the
--b2-versions flag.

If you wish to remove all the old versions then you can use the
rclone cleanup remote:bucket command which will delete all the old
versions of files, leaving the current ones intact. You can also supply
a path and only old versions under that path will be deleted, e.g.
rclone cleanup remote:bucket/path/to/stuff.

Note that cleanup will remove partially uploaded files from the bucket
if they are more than a day old.

When you purge a bucket, the current and the old versions will be
deleted then the bucket will be deleted.

However delete will cause the current versions of the files to become
hidden old versions.

Here is a session showing the listing and retrieval of an old version
followed by a cleanup of the old versions.

Show current version and all the versions with --b2-versions flag.

    $ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
            9 one.txt

    $ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
            9 one.txt
            8 one-v2016-07-04-141032-000.txt
           16 one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
           15 one-v2016-07-02-155621-000.txt

Retrieve an old version

    $ rclone -q --b2-versions copy b2:cleanup-test/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt /tmp

    $ ls -l /tmp/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 ncw ncw 16 Jul  2 17:46 /tmp/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt

Clean up all the old versions and show that they've gone.

    $ rclone -q cleanup b2:cleanup-test

    $ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
            9 one.txt

    $ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
            9 one.txt

Data usage

It is useful to know how many requests are sent to the server in
different scenarios.

All copy commands send the following 4 requests:

    /b2api/v1/b2_authorize_account
    /b2api/v1/b2_create_bucket
    /b2api/v1/b2_list_buckets
    /b2api/v1/b2_list_file_names

The b2_list_file_names request will be sent once for every 1k files in
the remote path, providing the checksum and modification time of the
listed files. As of version 1.33 issue #818 causes extra requests to be
sent when using B2 with Crypt. When a copy operation does not require
any files to be uploaded, no more requests will be sent.

Uploading files that do not require chunking, will send 2 requests per
file upload:

    /b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_url
    /b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/

Uploading files requiring chunking, will send 2 requests (one each to
start and finish the upload) and another 2 requests for each chunk:

    /b2api/v1/b2_start_large_file
    /b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_part_url
    /b2api/v1/b2_upload_part/
    /b2api/v1/b2_finish_large_file

Versions

Versions can be viewed with the --b2-versions flag. When it is set
rclone will show and act on older versions of files. For example

Listing without --b2-versions

    $ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
            9 one.txt

And with

    $ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
            9 one.txt
            8 one-v2016-07-04-141032-000.txt
           16 one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
           15 one-v2016-07-02-155621-000.txt

Showing that the current version is unchanged but older versions can be
seen. These have the UTC date that they were uploaded to the server to
the nearest millisecond appended to them.

Note that when using --b2-versions no file write operations are
permitted, so you can't upload files or delete them.

B2 and rclone link

Rclone supports generating file share links for private B2 buckets. They
can either be for a file for example:

    ./rclone link B2:bucket/path/to/file.txt
    https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file.txt?Authorization=xxxxxxxx

or if run on a directory you will get:

    ./rclone link B2:bucket/path
    https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path?Authorization=xxxxxxxx

you can then use the authorization token (the part of the url from the
?Authorization= on) on any file path under that directory. For example:

    https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file1?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
    https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/file2?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
    https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/folder/file3?Authorization=xxxxxxxx

Properties:

-   Config: account
-   Env Var: RCLONE_B2_ACCOUNT
-   Type: string
-   Required: true

--b2-key

Application Key.

Properties:

-   Config: key
-   Env Var: RCLONE_B2_KEY

-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to b2 (Backblaze B2).

--b2-endpoint

Endpoint for the service.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

-   Config: endpoint
-   Env Var: RCLONE_B2_ENDPOINT
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--b2-test-mode

A flag string for X-Bz-Test-Mode header for debugging.

This is for debugging purposes only. Setting it to one of the strings
below will cause b2 to return specific errors:

-   "fail_some_uploads"
-   "expire_some_account_authorization_tokens"
-   "force_cap_exceeded"

These will be set in the "X-Bz-Test-Mode" header which is documented in
the b2 integrations checklist.

Properties:

-   Config: test_mode
-   Env Var: RCLONE_B2_TEST_MODE
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--b2-versions

Include old versions in directory listings.

Note that when using this no file write operations are permitted, so you
can't upload files or delete them.

Properties:

-   Config: versions
-   Env Var: RCLONE_B2_VERSIONS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--b2-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload.

Files above this size will be uploaded in chunks of "--b2-chunk-size".

This value should be set no larger than 4.657 GiB (== 5 GB).

Properties:

-   Config: upload_cutoff
-   Env Var: RCLONE_B2_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 200Mi

--b2-copy-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to multipart copy.

Any files larger than this that need to be server-side copied will be
copied in chunks of this size.

The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 4.6 GiB.

Properties:

-   Config: copy_cutoff
-   Env Var: RCLONE_B2_COPY_CUTOFF
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 4Gi

--b2-chunk-size

Upload chunk size.

When uploading large files, chunk the file into this size.

Must fit in memory. These chunks are buffered in memory and there might
a maximum of "--transfers" chunks in progress at once.

5,000,000 Bytes is the minimum size.

Properties:

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_B2_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 96Mi

--b2-disable-checksum

Disable checksums for large (> upload cutoff) files.

Normally rclone will calculate the SHA1 checksum of the input before
uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great
for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files to
start uploading.

Properties:

-   Config: disable_checksum
-   Env Var: RCLONE_B2_DISABLE_CHECKSUM
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--b2-download-url

Custom endpoint for downloads.

This is usually set to a Cloudflare CDN URL as Backblaze offers free
egress for data downloaded through the Cloudflare network. Rclone works
with private buckets by sending an "Authorization" header. If the custom
endpoint rewrites the requests for authentication, e.g., in Cloudflare
Workers, this header needs to be handled properly. Leave blank if you
want to use the endpoint provided by Backblaze.

The URL provided here SHOULD have the protocol and SHOULD NOT have a
trailing slash or specify the /file/bucket subpath as rclone will
request files with "{download_url}/file/{bucket_name}/{path}".

Example: > https://mysubdomain.mydomain.tld (No trailing "/", "file" or
"bucket")

Properties:

-   Config: download_url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_B2_DOWNLOAD_URL
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--b2-download-auth-duration

Time before the authorization token will expire in s or suffix
ms|s|m|h|d.

The duration before the download authorization token will expire. The
minimum value is 1 second. The maximum value is one week.

Properties:

-   Config: download_auth_duration
-   Env Var: RCLONE_B2_DOWNLOAD_AUTH_DURATION
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 1w

--b2-memory-pool-flush-time

How often internal memory buffer pools will be flushed. Uploads which
requires additional buffers (f.e multipart) will use memory pool for
allocations. This option controls how often unused buffers will be
removed from the pool.

Properties:

-   Config: memory_pool_flush_time
-   Env Var: RCLONE_B2_MEMORY_POOL_FLUSH_TIME
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 1m0s

--b2-memory-pool-use-mmap

Whether to use mmap buffers in internal memory pool.

Properties:

-   Config: memory_pool_use_mmap
-   Env Var: RCLONE_B2_MEMORY_POOL_USE_MMAP
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--b2-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_B2_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: Slash,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot

Limitations

rclone about is not supported by the B2 backend. Backends without this
capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy
mfs (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.

See List of backends that do not support rclone about See rclone about

Box

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. remote:directory/subdirectory.

The initial setup for Box involves getting a token from Box which you
can do either in your browser, or with a config.json downloaded from Box
to use JWT authentication. rclone config walks you through it.

Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Box
       \ "box"
    [snip]
    Storage> box
    Box App Client Id - leave blank normally.
    client_id> 
    Box App Client Secret - leave blank normally.
    client_secret>
    Box App config.json location
    Leave blank normally.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    box_config_file>
    Box App Primary Access Token
    Leave blank normally.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    access_token>

    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("user").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
     1 / Rclone should act on behalf of a user
       \ "user"
     2 / Rclone should act on behalf of a service account
       \ "enterprise"
    box_sub_type>
    Remote config
    Use auto config?
     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [remote]
    client_id = 
    client_secret = 
    token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"XXX"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Box. This only runs from the moment it opens your
browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is on
http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to unblock it
temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your Box

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Box

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Box directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Using rclone with an Enterprise account with SSO

If you have an "Enterprise" account type with Box with single sign on
(SSO), you need to create a password to use Box with rclone. This can be
done at your Enterprise Box account by going to Settings, "Account" Tab,
and then set the password in the "Authentication" field.

Once you have done this, you can setup your Enterprise Box account using
the same procedure detailed above in the, using the password you have
just set.

Invalid refresh token

According to the box docs:

  Each refresh_token is valid for one use in 60 days.

This means that if you

-   Don't use the box remote for 60 days
-   Copy the config file with a box refresh token in and use it in two
    places
-   Get an error on a token refresh

then rclone will return an error which includes the text
Invalid refresh token.

To fix this you will need to use oauth2 again to update the refresh
token. You can use the methods in the remote setup docs, bearing in mind
that if you use the copy the config file method, you should not use that
remote on the computer you did the authentication on.

Here is how to do it.

    $ rclone config
    Current remotes:

    Name                 Type
    ====                 ====
    remote               box

    e) Edit existing remote
    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/r/c/s/q> e
    Choose a number from below, or type in an existing value
     1 > remote
    remote> remote
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = box
    token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"2017-07-08T23:40:08.059167677+01:00"}
    --------------------
    Edit remote
    Value "client_id" = ""
    Edit? (y/n)>
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> n
    Value "client_secret" = ""

     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = box
    token = {"access_token":"YYY","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"YYY","expiry":"2017-07-23T12:22:29.259137901+01:00"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Modified time and hashes

Box allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1 second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.

Box supports SHA1 type hashes, so you can use the --checksum flag.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  \            0x5C        ＼

File names can also not end with the following characters. These only
get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

Transfers

For files above 50 MiB rclone will use a chunked transfer. Rclone will
upload up to --transfers chunks at the same time (shared among all the
multipart uploads). Chunks are buffered in memory and are normally 8 MiB
so increasing --transfers will increase memory use.

Deleting files

Depending on the enterprise settings for your user, the item will either
be actually deleted from Box or moved to the trash.

Emptying the trash is supported via the rclone however cleanup command
however this deletes every trashed file and folder individually so it
may take a very long time. Emptying the trash via the WebUI does not
have this limitation so it is advised to empty the trash via the WebUI.

Root folder ID

You can set the root_folder_id for rclone. This is the directory
(identified by its Folder ID) that rclone considers to be the root of
your Box drive.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct
root to use itself.

However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.

In order to do this you will have to find the Folder ID of the directory
you wish rclone to display. This will be the last segment of the URL
when you open the relevant folder in the Box web interface.

So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
https://app.box.com/folder/11xxxxxxxxx8 in the browser, then you use
11xxxxxxxxx8 as the root_folder_id in the config.

Limitations

Note that Box is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

Box file names can't have the \ character in. rclone maps this to and
from an identical looking unicode equivalent ＼ (U+FF3C Fullwidth
Reverse Solidus).

Box only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.

rclone about is not supported by the Box backend. Backends without this
capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy
mfs (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.

See List of backends that do not support rclone about See rclone about

Cache (DEPRECATED)

The cache remote wraps another existing remote and stores file structure
and its data for long running tasks like rclone mount.

Status

The cache backend code is working but it currently doesn't have a
maintainer so there are outstanding bugs which aren't getting fixed.

The cache backend is due to be phased out in favour of the VFS caching
layer eventually which is more tightly integrated into rclone.

Until this happens we recommend only using the cache backend if you find
you can't work without it. There are many docs online describing the use
of the cache backend to minimize API hits and by-and-large these are out
of date and the cache backend isn't needed in those scenarios any more.

Configuration

To get started you just need to have an existing remote which can be
configured with cache.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called test-cache. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/r/c/s/q> n
    name> test-cache
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Cache a remote
       \ "cache"
    [snip]
    Storage> cache

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your drive

    rclone lsd test-cache:

List all the files in your drive

    rclone ls test-cache:

To start a cached mount

    rclone mount --allow-other test-cache: /var/tmp/test-cache

Write Features

Offline uploading

In an effort to make writing through cache more reliable, the backend
now supports this feature which can be activated by specifying a
cache-tmp-upload-path.

A files goes through these states when using this feature:

1.  An upload is started (usually by copying a file on the cache remote)
2.  When the copy to the temporary location is complete the file is part
    of the cached remote and looks and behaves like any other file
    (reading included)
3.  After cache-tmp-wait-time passes and the file is next in line,
    rclone move is used to move the file to the cloud provider
4.  Reading the file still works during the upload but most
    modifications on it will be prohibited
5.  Once the move is complete the file is unlocked for modifications as
    it becomes as any other regular file
6.  If the file is being read through cache when it's actually deleted
    from the temporary path then cache will simply swap the source to
    the cloud provider without interrupting the reading (small blip can
    happen though)

Files are uploaded in sequence and only one file is uploaded at a time.
Uploads will be stored in a queue and be processed based on the order
they were added. The queue and the temporary storage is persistent
across restarts but can be cleared on startup with the --cache-db-purge
flag.

Write Support

Writes are supported through cache. One caveat is that a mounted cache
remote does not add any retry or fallback mechanism to the upload
operation. This will depend on the implementation of the wrapped remote.
Consider using Offline uploading for reliable writes.

One special case is covered with cache-writes which will cache the file
data at the same time as the upload when it is enabled making it
available from the cache store immediately once the upload is finished.

Read Features

Multiple connections

To counter the high latency between a local PC where rclone is running
and cloud providers, the cache remote can split multiple requests to the
cloud provider for smaller file chunks and combines them together
locally where they can be available almost immediately before the reader
usually needs them.

This is similar to buffering when media files are played online. Rclone
will stay around the current marker but always try its best to stay
ahead and prepare the data before.

Plex Integration

There is a direct integration with Plex which allows cache to detect
during reading if the file is in playback or not. This helps cache to
adapt how it queries the cloud provider depending on what is needed for.

Scans will have a minimum amount of workers (1) while in a confirmed
playback cache will deploy the configured number of workers.

This integration opens the doorway to additional performance
improvements which will be explored in the near future.

Note: If Plex options are not configured, cache will function with its
configured options without adapting any of its settings.

How to enable? Run rclone config and add all the Plex options (endpoint,
username and password) in your remote and it will be automatically
enabled.

Affected settings: - cache-workers: Configured value during confirmed
playback or 1 all the other times

Certificate Validation

When the Plex server is configured to only accept secure connections, it
is possible to use .plex.direct URLs to ensure certificate validation
succeeds. These URLs are used by Plex internally to connect to the Plex
server securely.

The format for these URLs is the following:

https://ip-with-dots-replaced.server-hash.plex.direct:32400/

The ip-with-dots-replaced part can be any IPv4 address, where the dots
have been replaced with dashes, e.g. 127.0.0.1 becomes 127-0-0-1.

To get the server-hash part, the easiest way is to visit

https://plex.tv/api/resources?includeHttps=1&X-Plex-Token=your-plex-token

This page will list all the available Plex servers for your account with
at least one .plex.direct link for each. Copy one URL and replace the IP
address with the desired address. This can be used as the plex_url
value.

Known issues

Mount and --dir-cache-time

--dir-cache-time controls the first layer of directory caching which
works at the mount layer. Being an independent caching mechanism from
the cache backend, it will manage its own entries based on the
configured time.

To avoid getting in a scenario where dir cache has obsolete data and
cache would have the correct one, try to set --dir-cache-time to a lower
time than --cache-info-age. Default values are already configured in
this way.

Windows support - Experimental

There are a couple of issues with Windows mount functionality that still
require some investigations. It should be considered as experimental
thus far as fixes come in for this OS.

Most of the issues seem to be related to the difference between
filesystems on Linux flavors and Windows as cache is heavily dependent
on them.

Any reports or feedback on how cache behaves on this OS is greatly
appreciated.

Risk of throttling

Future iterations of the cache backend will make use of the pooling
functionality of the cloud provider to synchronize and at the same time
make writing through it more tolerant to failures.

There are a couple of enhancements in track to add these but in the
meantime there is a valid concern that the expiring cache listings can
lead to cloud provider throttles or bans due to repeated queries on it
for very large mounts.

Some recommendations: - don't use a very small interval for entry
information (--cache-info-age) - while writes aren't yet optimised, you
can still write through cache which gives you the advantage of adding
the file in the cache at the same time if configured to do so.

Future enhancements:

cache and crypt

One common scenario is to keep your data encrypted in the cloud provider
using the crypt remote. crypt uses a similar technique to wrap around an
existing remote and handles this translation in a seamless way.

There is an issue with wrapping the remotes in this order: cloud remote
-> crypt -> cache

During testing, I experienced a lot of bans with the remotes in this
order. I suspect it might be related to how crypt opens files on the
cloud provider which makes it think we're downloading the full file
instead of small chunks. Organizing the remotes in this order yields
better results: cloud remote -> cache -> crypt

absolute remote paths

cache can not differentiate between relative and absolute paths for the
wrapped remote. Any path given in the remote config setting and on the
command line will be passed to the wrapped remote as is, but for storing
the chunks on disk the path will be made relative by removing any
leading / character.

This behavior is irrelevant for most backend types, but there are
backends where a leading / changes the effective directory, e.g. in the
sftp backend paths starting with a / are relative to the root of the SSH
server and paths without are relative to the user home directory. As a
result sftp:bin and sftp:/bin will share the same cache folder, even if
they represent a different directory on the SSH server.

Cache and Remote Control (--rc)

Cache supports the new --rc mode in rclone and can be remote controlled
through the following end points: By default, the listener is disabled
if you do not add the flag.

rc cache/expire

Purge a remote from the cache backend. Supports either a directory or a
file. It supports both encrypted and unencrypted file names if cache is
wrapped by crypt.

Params: - remote = path to remote (required) - withData = true/false to
delete cached data (chunks) as well (optional, false by default)

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to cache (Cache a remote).

--cache-remote

Remote to cache.

Normally should contain a ':' and a path, e.g. "myremote:path/to/dir",
"myremote:bucket" or maybe "myremote:" (not recommended).

Properties:

-   Config: remote
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_REMOTE
-   Type: string
-   Required: true

--cache-plex-url

The URL of the Plex server.

Properties:

-   Config: plex_url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_URL
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--cache-plex-username

The username of the Plex user.

Properties:

-   Config: plex_username
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_USERNAME
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--cache-plex-password

The password of the Plex user.

NB Input to this must be obscured - see rclone obscure.

Properties:

-   Config: plex_password
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_PASSWORD
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--cache-chunk-size

The size of a chunk (partial file data).

Use lower numbers for slower connections. If the chunk size is changed,
any downloaded chunks will be invalid and cache-chunk-path will need to
be cleared or unexpected EOF errors will occur.

Properties:

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 5Mi
-   Examples:
    -   "1M"
        -   1 MiB
    -   "5M"
        -   5 MiB
    -   "10M"
        -   10 MiB

--cache-info-age

How long to cache file structure information (directory listings, file
size, times, etc.). If all write operations are done through the cache
then you can safely make this value very large as the cache store will
also be updated in real time.

Properties:

-   Config: info_age
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_INFO_AGE
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 6h0m0s
-   Examples:
    -   "1h"
        -   1 hour
    -   "24h"
        -   24 hours
    -   "48h"
        -   48 hours

--cache-chunk-total-size

The total size that the chunks can take up on the local disk.

If the cache exceeds this value then it will start to delete the oldest
chunks until it goes under this value.

Properties:

-   Config: chunk_total_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_TOTAL_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 10Gi
-   Examples:
    -   "500M"
        -   500 MiB
    -   "1G"
        -   1 GiB
    -   "10G"
        -   10 GiB

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to cache (Cache a remote).

--cache-plex-token

The plex token for authentication - auto set normally.

Properties:

-   Config: plex_token
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_TOKEN
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--cache-plex-insecure

Skip all certificate verification when connecting to the Plex server.

Properties:

-   Config: plex_insecure
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_INSECURE
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--cache-db-path

Directory to store file structure metadata DB.

The remote name is used as the DB file name.

Properties:

-   Config: db_path
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_DB_PATH
-   Type: string
-   Default: "$HOME/.cache/rclone/cache-backend"

--cache-chunk-path

Directory to cache chunk files.

Path to where partial file data (chunks) are stored locally. The remote
name is appended to the final path.

This config follows the "--cache-db-path". If you specify a custom
location for "--cache-db-path" and don't specify one for
"--cache-chunk-path" then "--cache-chunk-path" will use the same path as
"--cache-db-path".

Properties:

-   Config: chunk_path
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_PATH
-   Type: string
-   Default: "$HOME/.cache/rclone/cache-backend"

--cache-db-purge

Clear all the cached data for this remote on start.

Properties:

-   Config: db_purge
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_DB_PURGE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--cache-chunk-clean-interval

How often should the cache perform cleanups of the chunk storage.

The default value should be ok for most people. If you find that the
cache goes over "cache-chunk-total-size" too often then try to lower
this value to force it to perform cleanups more often.

Properties:

-   Config: chunk_clean_interval
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_CLEAN_INTERVAL
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 1m0s

--cache-read-retries

How many times to retry a read from a cache storage.

Since reading from a cache stream is independent from downloading file
data, readers can get to a point where there's no more data in the
cache. Most of the times this can indicate a connectivity issue if cache
isn't able to provide file data anymore.

For really slow connections, increase this to a point where the stream
is able to provide data but your experience will be very stuttering.

Properties:

-   Config: read_retries
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_READ_RETRIES
-   Type: int
-   Default: 10

--cache-workers

How many workers should run in parallel to download chunks.

Higher values will mean more parallel processing (better CPU needed) and
more concurrent requests on the cloud provider. This impacts several
aspects like the cloud provider API limits, more stress on the hardware
that rclone runs on but it also means that streams will be more fluid
and data will be available much more faster to readers.

Note: If the optional Plex integration is enabled then this setting will
adapt to the type of reading performed and the value specified here will
be used as a maximum number of workers to use.

Properties:

-   Config: workers
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_WORKERS
-   Type: int
-   Default: 4

--cache-chunk-no-memory

Disable the in-memory cache for storing chunks during streaming.

By default, cache will keep file data during streaming in RAM as well to
provide it to readers as fast as possible.

This transient data is evicted as soon as it is read and the number of
chunks stored doesn't exceed the number of workers. However, depending
on other settings like "cache-chunk-size" and "cache-workers" this
footprint can increase if there are parallel streams too (multiple files
being read at the same time).

If the hardware permits it, use this feature to provide an overall
better performance during streaming but it can also be disabled if RAM
is not available on the local machine.

Properties:

-   Config: chunk_no_memory
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_NO_MEMORY
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--cache-rps

Limits the number of requests per second to the source FS (-1 to
disable).

This setting places a hard limit on the number of requests per second
that cache will be doing to the cloud provider remote and try to respect
that value by setting waits between reads.

If you find that you're getting banned or limited on the cloud provider
through cache and know that a smaller number of requests per second will
allow you to work with it then you can use this setting for that.

A good balance of all the other settings should make this setting
useless but it is available to set for more special cases.

NOTE: This will limit the number of requests during streams but other
API calls to the cloud provider like directory listings will still pass.

Properties:

-   Config: rps
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_RPS
-   Type: int
-   Default: -1

--cache-writes

Cache file data on writes through the FS.

If you need to read files immediately after you upload them through
cache you can enable this flag to have their data stored in the cache
store at the same time during upload.

Properties:

-   Config: writes
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_WRITES
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--cache-tmp-upload-path

Directory to keep temporary files until they are uploaded.

This is the path where cache will use as a temporary storage for new
files that need to be uploaded to the cloud provider.

Specifying a value will enable this feature. Without it, it is
completely disabled and files will be uploaded directly to the cloud
provider

Properties:

-   Config: tmp_upload_path
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_TMP_UPLOAD_PATH
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--cache-tmp-wait-time

How long should files be stored in local cache before being uploaded.

This is the duration that a file must wait in the temporary location
cache-tmp-upload-path before it is selected for upload.

Note that only one file is uploaded at a time and it can take longer to
start the upload if a queue formed for this purpose.

Properties:

-   Config: tmp_wait_time
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_TMP_WAIT_TIME
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 15s

--cache-db-wait-time

How long to wait for the DB to be available - 0 is unlimited.

Only one process can have the DB open at any one time, so rclone waits
for this duration for the DB to become available before it gives an
error.

If you set it to 0 then it will wait forever.

Properties:

-   Config: db_wait_time
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_DB_WAIT_TIME
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 1s

Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the cache backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the "rclone backend" command for more info on how to pass options
and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
backend/command.

stats

Print stats on the cache backend in JSON format.

Chunker (BETA)

The chunker overlay transparently splits large files into smaller chunks
during upload to wrapped remote and transparently assembles them back
when the file is downloaded. This allows to effectively overcome size
limits imposed by storage providers.

Configuration

To use it, first set up the underlying remote following the
configuration instructions for that remote. You can also use a local
pathname instead of a remote.

First check your chosen remote is working - we'll call it remote:path
here. Note that anything inside remote:path will be chunked and anything
outside won't. This means that if you are using a bucket-based remote
(e.g. S3, B2, swift) then you should probably put the bucket in the
remote s3:bucket.

Now configure chunker using rclone config. We will call this one overlay
to separate it from the remote itself.

Specifying the remote

In normal use, make sure the remote has a : in. If you specify the
remote without a : then rclone will use a local directory of that name.
So if you use a remote of /path/to/secret/files then rclone will chunk
stuff in that directory. If you use a remote of name then rclone will
put files in a directory called name in the current directory.

Chunking

When rclone starts a file upload, chunker checks the file size. If it
doesn't exceed the configured chunk size, chunker will just pass the
file to the wrapped remote. If a file is large, chunker will
transparently cut data in pieces with temporary names and stream them
one by one, on the fly. Each data chunk will contain the specified
number of bytes, except for the last one which may have less data. If
file size is unknown in advance (this is called a streaming upload),
chunker will internally create a temporary copy, record its size and
repeat the above process.

When upload completes, temporary chunk files are finally renamed. This
scheme guarantees that operations can be run in parallel and look from
outside as atomic. A similar method with hidden temporary chunks is used
for other operations (copy/move/rename, etc.). If an operation fails,
hidden chunks are normally destroyed, and the target composite file
stays intact.

When a composite file download is requested, chunker transparently
assembles it by concatenating data chunks in order. As the split is
trivial one could even manually concatenate data chunks together to
obtain the original content.

When the list rclone command scans a directory on wrapped remote, the
potential chunk files are accounted for, grouped and assembled into
composite directory entries. Any temporary chunks are hidden.

List and other commands can sometimes come across composite files with
missing or invalid chunks, e.g. shadowed by like-named directory or
another file. This usually means that wrapped file system has been
directly tampered with or damaged. If chunker detects a missing chunk it
will by default print warning, skip the whole incomplete group of chunks
but proceed with current command. You can set the --chunker-fail-hard
flag to have commands abort with error message in such cases.

Chunk names

The default chunk name format is *.rclone_chunk.###, hence by default
chunk names are BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.001,
BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.002 etc. You can configure another name
format using the name_format configuration file option. The format uses
asterisk * as a placeholder for the base file name and one or more
consecutive hash characters # as a placeholder for sequential chunk
number. There must be one and only one asterisk. The number of
consecutive hash characters defines the minimum length of a string
representing a chunk number. If decimal chunk number has less digits
than the number of hashes, it is left-padded by zeros. If the decimal
string is longer, it is left intact. By default numbering starts from 1
but there is another option that allows user to start from 0, e.g. for
compatibility with legacy software.

For example, if name format is big_*-##.part and original file name is
data.txt and numbering starts from 0, then the first chunk will be named
big_data.txt-00.part, the 99th chunk will be big_data.txt-98.part and
the 302nd chunk will become big_data.txt-301.part.

Note that list assembles composite directory entries only when chunk
names match the configured format and treats non-conforming file names
as normal non-chunked files.

When using norename transactions, chunk names will additionally have a
unique file version suffix. For example,
BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.001_bp562k.

Metadata

Besides data chunks chunker will by default create metadata object for a
composite file. The object is named after the original file. Chunker
allows user to disable metadata completely (the none format). Note that
metadata is normally not created for files smaller than the configured
chunk size. This may change in future rclone releases.

Simple JSON metadata format

This is the default format. It supports hash sums and chunk validation
for composite files. Meta objects carry the following fields:

-   ver - version of format, currently 1
-   size - total size of composite file
-   nchunks - number of data chunks in file
-   md5 - MD5 hashsum of composite file (if present)
-   sha1 - SHA1 hashsum (if present)
-   txn - identifies current version of the file

There is no field for composite file name as it's simply equal to the
name of meta object on the wrapped remote. Please refer to respective
sections for details on hashsums and modified time handling.

No metadata

You can disable meta objects by setting the meta format option to none.
In this mode chunker will scan directory for all files that follow
configured chunk name format, group them by detecting chunks with the
same base name and show group names as virtual composite files. This
method is more prone to missing chunk errors (especially missing last
chunk) than format with metadata enabled.

Hashsums

Chunker supports hashsums only when a compatible metadata is present.
Hence, if you choose metadata format of none, chunker will report
hashsum as UNSUPPORTED.

Please note that by default metadata is stored only for composite files.
If a file is smaller than configured chunk size, chunker will
transparently redirect hash requests to wrapped remote, so support
depends on that. You will see the empty string as a hashsum of requested
type for small files if the wrapped remote doesn't support it.

Many storage backends support MD5 and SHA1 hash types, so does chunker.
With chunker you can choose one or another but not both. MD5 is set by
default as the most supported type. Since chunker keeps hashes for
composite files and falls back to the wrapped remote hash for
non-chunked ones, we advise you to choose the same hash type as
supported by wrapped remote so that your file listings look coherent.

If your storage backend does not support MD5 or SHA1 but you need
consistent file hashing, configure chunker with md5all or sha1all. These
two modes guarantee given hash for all files. If wrapped remote doesn't
support it, chunker will then add metadata to all files, even small.
However, this can double the amount of small files in storage and incur
additional service charges. You can even use chunker to force md5/sha1
support in any other remote at expense of sidecar meta objects by
setting e.g. chunk_type=sha1all to force hashsums and chunk_size=1P to
effectively disable chunking.

Normally, when a file is copied to chunker controlled remote, chunker
will ask the file source for compatible file hash and revert to
on-the-fly calculation if none is found. This involves some CPU overhead
but provides a guarantee that given hashsum is available. Also, chunker
will reject a server-side copy or move operation if source and
destination hashsum types are different resulting in the extra network
bandwidth, too. In some rare cases this may be undesired, so chunker
provides two optional choices: sha1quick and md5quick. If the source
does not support primary hash type and the quick mode is enabled,
chunker will try to fall back to the secondary type. This will save CPU
and bandwidth but can result in empty hashsums at destination. Beware of
consequences: the sync command will revert (sometimes silently) to
time/size comparison if compatible hashsums between source and target
are not found.

Modified time

Chunker stores modification times using the wrapped remote so support
depends on that. For a small non-chunked file the chunker overlay simply
manipulates modification time of the wrapped remote file. For a
composite file with metadata chunker will get and set modification time
of the metadata object on the wrapped remote. If file is chunked but
metadata format is none then chunker will use modification time of the
first data chunk.

Migrations

The idiomatic way to migrate to a different chunk size, hash type,
transaction style or chunk naming scheme is to:

-   Collect all your chunked files under a directory and have your
    chunker remote point to it.
-   Create another directory (most probably on the same cloud storage)
    and configure a new remote with desired metadata format, hash type,
    chunk naming etc.
-   Now run rclone sync -i oldchunks: newchunks: and all your data will
    be transparently converted in transfer. This may take some time, yet
    chunker will try server-side copy if possible.
-   After checking data integrity you may remove configuration section
    of the old remote.

If rclone gets killed during a long operation on a big composite file,
hidden temporary chunks may stay in the directory. They will not be
shown by the list command but will eat up your account quota. Please
note that the deletefile command deletes only active chunks of a file.
As a workaround, you can use remote of the wrapped file system to see
them. An easy way to get rid of hidden garbage is to copy littered
directory somewhere using the chunker remote and purge the original
directory. The copy command will copy only active chunks while the purge
will remove everything including garbage.

Caveats and Limitations

Chunker requires wrapped remote to support server-side move (or copy +
delete) operations, otherwise it will explicitly refuse to start. This
is because it internally renames temporary chunk files to their final
names when an operation completes successfully.

Chunker encodes chunk number in file name, so with default name_format
setting it adds 17 characters. Also chunker adds 7 characters of
temporary suffix during operations. Many file systems limit base file
name without path by 255 characters. Using rclone's crypt remote as a
base file system limits file name by 143 characters. Thus, maximum name
length is 231 for most files and 119 for chunker-over-crypt. A user in
need can change name format to e.g. *.rcc## and save 10 characters
(provided at most 99 chunks per file).

Note that a move implemented using the copy-and-delete method may incur
double charging with some cloud storage providers.

Chunker will not automatically rename existing chunks when you run
rclone config on a live remote and change the chunk name format. Beware
that in result of this some files which have been treated as chunks
before the change can pop up in directory listings as normal files and
vice versa. The same warning holds for the chunk size. If you
desperately need to change critical chunking settings, you should run
data migration as described above.

If wrapped remote is case insensitive, the chunker overlay will inherit
that property (so you can't have a file called "Hello.doc" and
"hello.doc" in the same directory).

Chunker included in rclone releases up to v1.54 can sometimes fail to
detect metadata produced by recent versions of rclone. We recommend
users to keep rclone up-to-date to avoid data corruption.

Changing transactions is dangerous and requires explicit migration.

Standard options

        -   Falling back to SHA1 if unsupported.
    -   "sha1quick"
        -   Similar to "md5quick" but prefers SHA1 over MD5.

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to chunker (Transparently
chunk/split large files).

--chunker-name-format

String format of chunk file names.

The two placeholders are: base file name (*) and chunk number (#...).
There must be one and only one asterisk and one or more consecutive hash
characters. If chunk number has less digits than the number of hashes,
it is left-padded by zeros. If there are more digits in the number, they
are left as is. Possible chunk files are ignored if their name does not
match given format.

Properties:

-   Config: fail_hard
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CHUNKER_FAIL_HARD
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false
-   Examples:
    -   "true"
        -   Report errors and abort current command.
    -   "false"
        -   Warn user, skip incomplete file and proceed.

--chunker-transactions

Choose how chunker should handle temporary files during transactions.

Properties:

-   Config: transactions
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CHUNKER_TRANSACTIONS
-   Type: string

        -   Leave temporary file names and write transaction ID to
            metadata file.
        -   Metadata is required for no rename transactions (meta format
            cannot be "none").
        -   If you are using norename transactions you should be careful
            not to downgrade Rclone
        -   as older versions of Rclone don't support this transaction
            style and will misinterpret
        -   files manipulated by norename transactions.
        -   This method is EXPERIMENTAL, don't use on production
            systems.
    -   "auto"
        -   Rename or norename will be used depending on capabilities of
            the backend.
        -   If meta format is set to "none", rename transactions will
            always be used.
        -   This method is EXPERIMENTAL, don't use on production
            systems.

Citrix ShareFile

Citrix ShareFile is a secure file sharing and transfer service aimed as
business.

Configuration

The initial setup for Citrix ShareFile involves getting a token from
Citrix ShareFile which you can in your browser. rclone config walks you
through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    XX / Citrix Sharefile
       \ "sharefile"
    Storage> sharefile
    ** See help for sharefile backend at: https://rclone.org/sharefile/ **

    ID of the root folder

    Leave blank to access "Personal Folders".  You can use one of the
    standard values here or any folder ID (long hex number ID).
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
     1 / Access the Personal Folders. (Default)
       \ ""
     2 / Access the Favorites folder.
       \ "favorites"
     3 / Access all the shared folders.
       \ "allshared"
     4 / Access all the individual connectors.
       \ "connectors"
     5 / Access the home, favorites, and shared folders as well as the connectors.
       \ "top"
    root_folder_id> 
    Edit advanced config? (y/n)
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> n
    Remote config
    Use auto config?
     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth?state=XXX
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = sharefile
    endpoint = https://XXX.sharefile.com
    token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"2019-09-30T19:41:45.878561877+01:00"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Citrix ShareFile. This only runs from the moment
it opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.
This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to
unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your ShareFile

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your ShareFile

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an ShareFile directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. remote:directory/subdirectory.

Modified time and hashes

ShareFile allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

ShareFile supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the --checksum flag.

Transfers

For files above 128 MiB rclone will use a chunked transfer. Rclone will
upload up to --transfers chunks at the same time (shared among all the
multipart uploads). Chunks are buffered in memory and are normally 64
MiB so increasing --transfers will increase memory use.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  \            0x5C        ＼
  *            0x2A        ＊
  <            0x3C        ＜
  >            0x3E        ＞
  ?            0x3F        ？
  :            0x3A        ：
  |            0x7C        ｜
  "            0x22        ＂

File names can also not start or end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the first or last character in the
name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠
  .            0x2E        ．

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

    Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,LeftSpace,LeftPeriod,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot

Limitations

Note that ShareFile is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

ShareFile only supports filenames up to 256 characters in length.

rclone about is not supported by the Citrix ShareFile backend. Backends
without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount
or use policy mfs (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See List of backends that do not support rclone about See rclone about

Crypt

Rclone crypt remotes encrypt and decrypt other remotes.

A remote of type crypt does not access a storage system directly, but
instead wraps another remote, which in turn accesses the storage system.
This is similar to how alias, union, chunker and a few others work. It
makes the usage very flexible, as you can add a layer, in this case an
encryption layer, on top of any other backend, even in multiple layers.
Rclone's functionality can be used as with any other remote, for example
you can mount a crypt remote.

Accessing a storage system through a crypt remote realizes client-side
encryption, which makes it safe to keep your data in a location you do
not trust will not get compromised. When working against the crypt
remote, rclone will automatically encrypt (before uploading) and decrypt
(after downloading) on your local system as needed on the fly, leaving
the data encrypted at rest in the wrapped remote. If you access the
storage system using an application other than rclone, or access the
wrapped remote directly using rclone, there will not be any
encryption/decryption: Downloading existing content will just give you
the encrypted (scrambled) format, and anything you upload will not
become encrypted.

The encryption is a secret-key encryption (also called symmetric key
encryption) algorithm, where a password (or pass phrase) is used to
generate real encryption key. The password can be supplied by user, or
you may chose to let rclone generate one. It will be stored in the
configuration file, in a lightly obscured form. If you are in an
environment where you are not able to keep your configuration secured,
you should add configuration encryption as protection. As long as you
have this configuration file, you will be able to decrypt your data.
Without the configuration file, as long as you remember the password (or
keep it in a safe place), you can re-create the configuration and gain
access to the existing data. You may also configure a corresponding
remote in a different installation to access the same data. See below
for guidance to changing password.

Encryption uses cryptographic salt, to permute the encryption key so
that the same string may be encrypted in different ways. When
configuring the crypt remote it is optional to enter a salt, or to let
rclone generate a unique salt. If omitted, rclone uses a built-in unique
string. Normally in cryptography, the salt is stored together with the
encrypted content, and do not have to be memorized by the user. This is
not the case in rclone, because rclone does not store any additional
information on the remotes. Use of custom salt is effectively a second
password that must be memorized.

File content encryption is performed using NaCl SecretBox, based on
XSalsa20 cipher and Poly1305 for integrity. Names (file- and directory
names) are also encrypted by default, but this has some implications and
is therefore possible to turned off.

Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called secret.

To use crypt, first set up the underlying remote. Follow the
rclone config instructions for the specific backend.

Before configuring the crypt remote, check the underlying remote is
working. In this example the underlying remote is called remote. We will
configure a path path within this remote to contain the encrypted
content. Anything inside remote:path will be encrypted and anything
outside will not.

Configure crypt using rclone config. In this example the crypt remote is
called secret, to differentiate it from the underlying remote.

When you are done you can use the crypt remote named secret just as you
would with any other remote, e.g. rclone copy D:\docs secret:\docs, and
rclone will encrypt and decrypt as needed on the fly. If you access the
wrapped remote remote:path directly you will bypass the encryption, and
anything you read will be in encrypted form, and anything you write will
be unencrypted. To avoid issues it is best to configure a dedicated path
for encrypted content, and access it exclusively through a crypt remote.

Important The crypt password stored in rclone.conf is lightly obscured.
That only protects it from cursory inspection. It is not secure unless
configuration encryption of rclone.conf is specified.

A long passphrase is recommended, or rclone config can generate a random
one.

The obscured password is created using AES-CTR with a static key. The
salt is stored verbatim at the beginning of the obscured password. This
static key is shared between all versions of rclone.

If you reconfigure rclone with the same passwords/passphrases elsewhere
it will be compatible, but the obscured version will be different due to
the different salt.

Rclone does not encrypt

-   file length - this can be calculated within 16 bytes
-   modification time - used for syncing

Specifying the remote

When configuring the remote to encrypt/decrypt, you may specify any
string that rclone accepts as a source/destination of other commands.

The primary use case is to specify the path into an already configured
remote (e.g. remote:path/to/dir or remote:bucket), such that data in a
remote untrusted location can be stored encrypted.

You may also specify a local filesystem path, such as /path/to/dir on
Linux, C:\path\to\dir on Windows. By creating a crypt remote pointing to
such a local filesystem path, you can use rclone as a utility for pure
local file encryption, for example to keep encrypted files on a
removable USB drive.

Note: A string which do not contain a : will by rclone be treated as a
relative path in the local filesystem. For example, if you enter the
name remote without the trailing :, it will be treated as a subdirectory
of the current directory with name "remote".

If a path remote:path/to/dir is specified, rclone stores encrypted files
in path/to/dir on the remote. With file name encryption, files saved to
secret:subdir/subfile are stored in the unencrypted path path/to/dir but
the subdir/subpath element is encrypted.

The path you specify does not have to exist, rclone will create it when
needed.

If you intend to use the wrapped remote both directly for keeping
unencrypted content, as well as through a crypt remote for encrypted
content, it is recommended to point the crypt remote to a separate
directory within the wrapped remote. If you use a bucket-based storage
system (e.g. Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2, Hubic) it is
generally advisable to wrap the crypt remote around a specific bucket
(s3:bucket). If wrapping around the entire root of the storage (s3:),
and use the optional file name encryption, rclone will encrypt the
bucket name.

Changing password

Should the password, or the configuration file containing a lightly
obscured form of the password, be compromised, you need to re-encrypt
your data with a new password. Since rclone uses secret-key encryption,
where the encryption key is generated directly from the password kept on
the client, it is not possible to change the password/key of already
encrypted content. Just changing the password configured for an existing
crypt remote means you will no longer able to decrypt any of the
previously encrypted content. The only possibility is to re-upload
everything via a crypt remote configured with your new password.

Depending on the size of your data, your bandwith, storage quota etc,
there are different approaches you can take: - If you have everything in
a different location, for example on your local system, you could remove
all of the prior encrypted files, change the password for your
configured crypt remote (or delete and re-create the crypt
configuration), and then re-upload everything from the alternative
location. - If you have enough space on the storage system you can
create a new crypt remote pointing to a separate directory on the same
backend, and then use rclone to copy everything from the original crypt
remote to the new, effectively decrypting everything on the fly using
the old password and re-encrypting using the new password. When done,
delete the original crypt remote directory and finally the rclone crypt
configuration with the old password. All data will be streamed from the
storage system and back, so you will get half the bandwith and be
charged twice if you have upload and download quota on the storage
system.

Note: A security problem related to the random password generator was
fixed in rclone version 1.53.3 (released 2020-11-19). Passwords
generated by rclone config in version 1.49.0 (released 2019-08-26) to
1.53.2 (released 2020-10-26) are not considered secure and should be
changed. If you made up your own password, or used rclone version older
than 1.49.0 or newer than 1.53.2 to generate it, you are not affected by
this issue. See issue #4783 for more details, and a tool you can use to
check if you are affected.

Example

Create the following file structure using "standard" file name
encryption.

    plaintext/
    ├── file0.txt
    ├── file1.txt
    └── subdir
        ├── file2.txt
        ├── file3.txt
        └── subsubdir
            └── file4.txt

Copy these to the remote, and list them

    $ rclone -q copy plaintext secret:
    $ rclone -q ls secret:
            7 file1.txt
            6 file0.txt
            8 subdir/file2.txt
           10 subdir/subsubdir/file4.txt
            9 subdir/file3.txt

The crypt remote looks like

    $ rclone -q ls remote:path
           55 hagjclgavj2mbiqm6u6cnjjqcg
           54 v05749mltvv1tf4onltun46gls
           57 86vhrsv86mpbtd3a0akjuqslj8/dlj7fkq4kdq72emafg7a7s41uo
           58 86vhrsv86mpbtd3a0akjuqslj8/7uu829995du6o42n32otfhjqp4/b9pausrfansjth5ob3jkdqd4lc
           56 86vhrsv86mpbtd3a0akjuqslj8/8njh1sk437gttmep3p70g81aps

The directory structure is preserved

    $ rclone -q ls secret:subdir
            8 file2.txt
            9 file3.txt
           10 subsubdir/file4.txt

Without file name encryption .bin extensions are added to underlying
names. This prevents the cloud provider attempting to interpret file
content.

    $ rclone -q ls remote:path
           54 file0.txt.bin
           57 subdir/file3.txt.bin
           56 subdir/file2.txt.bin
           58 subdir/subsubdir/file4.txt.bin
           55 file1.txt.bin

File name encryption modes

Off

-   doesn't hide file names or directory structure
-   allows for longer file names (~246 characters)
-   can use sub paths and copy single files

Standard

-   file names encrypted
-   file names can't be as long (~143 characters)
-   can use sub paths and copy single files
-   directory structure visible
-   identical files names will have identical uploaded names
-   can use shortcuts to shorten the directory recursion

Obfuscation

This is a simple "rotate" of the filename, with each file having a rot
distance based on the filename. Rclone stores the distance at the
beginning of the filename. A file called "hello" may become "53.jgnnq".

Obfuscation is not a strong encryption of filenames, but hinders
automated scanning tools picking up on filename patterns. It is an
intermediate between "off" and "standard" which allows for longer path
segment names.

There is a possibility with some unicode based filenames that the
obfuscation is weak and may map lower case characters to upper case
equivalents.

Obfuscation cannot be relied upon for strong protection.

-   file names very lightly obfuscated
-   file names can be longer than standard encryption
-   can use sub paths and copy single files
-   directory structure visible
-   identical files names will have identical uploaded names

Cloud storage systems have limits on file name length and total path
length which rclone is more likely to breach using "Standard" file name
encryption. Where file names are less than 156 characters in length
issues should not be encountered, irrespective of cloud storage
provider.

An experimental advanced option filename_encoding is now provided to
address this problem to a certain degree. For cloud storage systems with
case sensitive file names (e.g. Google Drive), base64 can be used to
reduce file name length. For cloud storage systems using UTF-16 to store
file names internally (e.g. OneDrive), base32768 can be used to
drastically reduce file name length.

An alternative, future rclone file name encryption mode may tolerate
backend provider path length limits.

Directory name encryption

Crypt offers the option of encrypting dir names or leaving them intact.
There are two options:

True

Encrypts the whole file path including directory names Example:
1/12/123.txt is encrypted to
p0e52nreeaj0a5ea7s64m4j72s/l42g6771hnv3an9cgc8cr2n1ng/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0

False

Only encrypts file names, skips directory names Example: 1/12/123.txt is
encrypted to 1/12/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0

Modified time and hashes

Crypt stores modification times using the underlying remote so support
depends on that.

Hashes are not stored for crypt. However the data integrity is protected
by an extremely strong crypto authenticator.

Use the rclone cryptcheck command to check the integrity of a crypted
remote instead of rclone check which can't check the checksums properly.

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to crypt (Encrypt/Decrypt a
remote).

--crypt-remote

Remote to encrypt/decrypt.

Normally should contain a ':' and a path, e.g. "myremote:path/to/dir",
"myremote:bucket" or maybe "myremote:" (not recommended).

Properties:

-   Config: remote
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_REMOTE
-   Type: string
-   Required: true

--crypt-filename-encryption

How to encrypt the filenames.

Properties:

-   Config: filename_encryption
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_FILENAME_ENCRYPTION
-   Type: string
-   Default: "standard"
-   Examples:
    -   "standard"
        -   Encrypt the filenames.
        -   See the docs for the details.
    -   "obfuscate"
        -   Very simple filename obfuscation.
    -   "off"
        -   Don't encrypt the file names.
        -   Adds a ".bin" extension only.

--crypt-directory-name-encryption

Option to either encrypt directory names or leave them intact.

NB If filename_encryption is "off" then this option will do nothing.

Properties:

-   Config: directory_name_encryption
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_DIRECTORY_NAME_ENCRYPTION
-   Type: bool
-   Default: true
-   Examples:
    -   "true"
        -   Encrypt directory names.
    -   "false"
        -   Don't encrypt directory names, leave them intact.

--crypt-password

Password or pass phrase for encryption.

NB Input to this must be obscured - see rclone obscure.

Properties:

-   Config: password
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_PASSWORD
-   Type: string
-   Required: true

--crypt-password2

Password or pass phrase for salt.

Optional but recommended. Should be different to the previous password.

NB Input to this must be obscured - see rclone obscure.

Properties:

-   Config: password2
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_PASSWORD2
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to crypt (Encrypt/Decrypt a
remote).

--crypt-server-side-across-configs

Allow server-side operations (e.g. copy) to work across different crypt
configs.

Normally this option is not what you want, but if you have two crypts
pointing to the same backend you can use it.

This can be used, for example, to change file name encryption type
without re-uploading all the data. Just make two crypt backends pointing
to two different directories with the single changed parameter and use
rclone move to move the files between the crypt remotes.

Properties:

-   Config: server_side_across_configs
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_SERVER_SIDE_ACROSS_CONFIGS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--crypt-show-mapping

For all files listed show how the names encrypt.

If this flag is set then for each file that the remote is asked to list,
it will log (at level INFO) a line stating the decrypted file name and
the encrypted file name.

This is so you can work out which encrypted names are which decrypted
names just in case you need to do something with the encrypted file
names, or for debugging purposes.

Properties:

-   Config: show_mapping
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_SHOW_MAPPING
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--crypt-no-data-encryption

Option to either encrypt file data or leave it unencrypted.

Properties:

-   Config: no_data_encryption
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_NO_DATA_ENCRYPTION
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false
-   Examples:
    -   "true"
        -   Don't encrypt file data, leave it unencrypted.
    -   "false"
        -   Encrypt file data.

--crypt-filename-encoding

How to encode the encrypted filename to text string.

This option could help with shortening the encrypted filename. The
suitable option would depend on the way your remote count the filename
length and if it's case sensitve.

Properties:

-   Config: filename_encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_FILENAME_ENCODING
-   Type: string
-   Default: "base32"
-   Examples:
    -   "base32"
        -   Encode using base32. Suitable for all remote.
    -   "base64"
        -   Encode using base64. Suitable for case sensitive remote.
    -   "base32768"
        -   Encode using base32768. Suitable if your remote counts
            UTF-16 or
        -   Unicode codepoint instead of UTF-8 byte length. (Eg.
            Onedrive)

Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the crypt backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the "rclone backend" command for more info on how to pass options
and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
backend/command.

encode

Encode the given filename(s)

    rclone backend encode remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This encodes the filenames given as arguments returning a list of
strings of the encoded results.

Usage Example:

    rclone backend encode crypt: file1 [file2...]
    rclone rc backend/command command=encode fs=crypt: file1 [file2...]

decode

Decode the given filename(s)

    rclone backend decode remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This decodes the filenames given as arguments returning a list of
strings of the decoded results. It will return an error if any of the
inputs are invalid.

Usage Example:

    rclone backend decode crypt: encryptedfile1 [encryptedfile2...]
    rclone rc backend/command command=decode fs=crypt: encryptedfile1 [encryptedfile2...]

Backing up a crypted remote

If you wish to backup a crypted remote, it is recommended that you use
rclone sync on the encrypted files, and make sure the passwords are the
same in the new encrypted remote.

This will have the following advantages

-   rclone sync will check the checksums while copying
-   you can use rclone check between the encrypted remotes
-   you don't decrypt and encrypt unnecessarily

For example, let's say you have your original remote at remote: with the
encrypted version at eremote: with path remote:crypt. You would then set
up the new remote remote2: and then the encrypted version eremote2: with
path remote2:crypt using the same passwords as eremote:.

To sync the two remotes you would do

    rclone sync -i remote:crypt remote2:crypt

And to check the integrity you would do

    rclone check remote:crypt remote2:crypt

File formats

File encryption

Files are encrypted 1:1 source file to destination object. The file has
a header and is divided into chunks.

Header

-   8 bytes magic string RCLONE\x00\x00
-   24 bytes Nonce (IV)

The initial nonce is generated from the operating systems crypto strong
random number generator. The nonce is incremented for each chunk read
making sure each nonce is unique for each block written. The chance of a
nonce being re-used is minuscule. If you wrote an exabyte of data (10¹⁸
bytes) you would have a probability of approximately 2×10⁻³² of re-using
a nonce.

Chunk

Each chunk will contain 64 KiB of data, except for the last one which
may have less data. The data chunk is in standard NaCl SecretBox format.
SecretBox uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate
messages.

Each chunk contains:

-   16 Bytes of Poly1305 authenticator
-   1 - 65536 bytes XSalsa20 encrypted data

64k chunk size was chosen as the best performing chunk size (the
authenticator takes too much time below this and the performance drops
off due to cache effects above this). Note that these chunks are
buffered in memory so they can't be too big.

This uses a 32 byte (256 bit key) key derived from the user password.

Examples

1 byte file will encrypt to

-   32 bytes header
-   17 bytes data chunk

49 bytes total

1 MiB (1048576 bytes) file will encrypt to

-   32 bytes header
-   16 chunks of 65568 bytes

1049120 bytes total (a 0.05% overhead). This is the overhead for big
files.

Name encryption

File names are encrypted segment by segment - the path is broken up into
/ separated strings and these are encrypted individually.

File segments are padded using PKCS#7 to a multiple of 16 bytes before
encryption.

They are then encrypted with EME using AES with 256 bit key. EME
(ECB-Mix-ECB) is a wide-block encryption mode presented in the 2003
paper "A Parallelizable Enciphering Mode" by Halevi and Rogaway.

This makes for deterministic encryption which is what we want - the same
filename must encrypt to the same thing otherwise we can't find it on
the cloud storage system.

This means that

-   filenames with the same name will encrypt the same
-   filenames which start the same won't have a common prefix

This uses a 32 byte key (256 bits) and a 16 byte (128 bits) IV both of
which are derived from the user password.

After encryption they are written out using a modified version of
standard base32 encoding as described in RFC4648. The standard encoding
is modified in two ways:

-   it becomes lower case (no-one likes upper case filenames!)
-   we strip the padding character =

base32 is used rather than the more efficient base64 so rclone can be
used on case insensitive remotes (e.g. Windows, Amazon Drive).

Key derivation

Rclone uses scrypt with parameters N=16384, r=8, p=1 with an optional
user supplied salt (password2) to derive the 32+32+16 = 80 bytes of key
material required. If the user doesn't supply a salt then rclone uses an
internal one.

scrypt makes it impractical to mount a dictionary attack on rclone
encrypted data. For full protection against this you should always use a
salt.

Compress (Experimental)

Warning

This remote is currently experimental. Things may break and data may be
lost. Anything you do with this remote is at your own risk. Please
understand the risks associated with using experimental code and don't
use this remote in critical applications.

The Compress remote adds compression to another remote. It is best used
with remotes containing many large compressible files.

Configuration

To use this remote, all you need to do is specify another remote and a
compression mode to use:

    Current remotes:

    Name                 Type
    ====                 ====
    remote_to_press      sometype

    e) Edit existing remote
    $ rclone config
    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/r/c/s/q> n
    name> compress
    ...
     8 / Compress a remote

    Compression mode.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("gzip").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
     1 / Gzip compression balanced for speed and compression strength.
       \ "gzip"

    --------------------
    [compress]
    type = compress
    remote = remote_to_press:subdir
    compression_mode = gzip
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK (default)
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Compression Modes

Currently only gzip compression is supported. It provides a decent
balance between speed and size and is well supported by other
applications. Compression strength can further be configured via an
advanced setting where 0 is no compression and 9 is strongest
compression.

File types

If you open a remote wrapped by compress, you will see that there are
many files with an extension corresponding to the compression algorithm
you chose. These files are standard files that can be opened by various
archive programs, but they have some hidden metadata that allows them to
be used by rclone. While you may download and decompress these files at
will, do not manually delete or rename files. Files without correct
metadata files will not be recognized by rclone.

File names

The compressed files will be named *.###########.gz where * is the base
file and the # part is base64 encoded size of the uncompressed file. The
file names should not be changed by anything other than the rclone
compression backend.

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to compress (Compress a remote).

--compress-remote

Remote to compress.

Properties:

-   Config: remote
-   Env Var: RCLONE_COMPRESS_REMOTE
-   Type: string
-   Required: true

--compress-mode

Compression mode.

Properties:

-   Config: mode
-   Env Var: RCLONE_COMPRESS_MODE
-   Type: string
-   Default: "gzip"
-   Examples:
    -   "gzip"
        -   Standard gzip compression with fastest parameters.

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to compress (Compress a remote).

--compress-level

GZIP compression level (-2 to 9).

Generally -1 (default, equivalent to 5) is recommended. Levels 1 to 9
increase compression at the cost of speed. Going past 6 generally offers
very little return.

Level -2 uses Huffmann encoding only. Only use if you know what you are
doing. Level 0 turns off compression.

Properties:

-   Config: level
-   Env Var: RCLONE_COMPRESS_LEVEL
-   Type: int
-   Default: -1

--compress-ram-cache-limit

Some remotes don't allow the upload of files with unknown size. In this
case the compressed file will need to be cached to determine it's size.

Files smaller than this limit will be cached in RAM, files larger than
this limit will be cached on disk.

Properties:

-   Config: ram_cache_limit
-   Env Var: RCLONE_COMPRESS_RAM_CACHE_LIMIT
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 20Mi

Dropbox

Paths are specified as remote:path

Dropbox paths may be as deep as required, e.g.
remote:directory/subdirectory.

Configuration

The initial setup for dropbox involves getting a token from Dropbox
which you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through
it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Dropbox
       \ "dropbox"
    [snip]
    Storage> dropbox
    Dropbox App Key - leave blank normally.
    app_key>
    Dropbox App Secret - leave blank normally.
    app_secret>
    Remote config
    Please visit:
    https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/authorize?client_id=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&response_type=code
    Enter the code: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_XXXXXXXXXX
    --------------------
    [remote]
    app_key =
    app_secret =
    token = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_XXXX_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your dropbox

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your dropbox

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a dropbox directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Dropbox for business

Rclone supports Dropbox for business and Team Folders.

When using Dropbox for business remote: and remote:path/to/file will
refer to your personal folder.

If you wish to see Team Folders you must use a leading / in the path, so
rclone lsd remote:/ will refer to the root and show you all Team Folders
and your User Folder.

You can then use team folders like this remote:/TeamFolder and
remote:/TeamFolder/path/to/file.

A leading / for a Dropbox personal account will do nothing, but it will
take an extra HTTP transaction so it should be avoided.

Modified time and Hashes

Dropbox supports modified times, but the only way to set a modification
time is to re-upload the file.

This means that if you uploaded your data with an older version of
rclone which didn't support the v2 API and modified times, rclone will
decide to upload all your old data to fix the modification times. If you
don't want this to happen use --size-only or --checksum flag to stop it.

Dropbox supports its own hash type which is checked for all transfers.

Restricted filename characters

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  NUL          0x00         ␀
  /            0x2F        ／
  DEL          0x7F         ␡
  \            0x5C        ＼

File names can also not end with the following characters. These only
get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

Batch mode uploads

Using batch mode uploads is very important for performance when using
the Dropbox API. See the dropbox performance guide for more info.

There are 3 modes rclone can use for uploads.

--dropbox-batch-mode off

In this mode rclone will not use upload batching. This was the default
before rclone v1.55. It has the disadvantage that it is very likely to
encounter too_many_requests errors like this

    NOTICE: too_many_requests/.: Too many requests or write operations. Trying again in 15 seconds.

When rclone receives these it has to wait for 15s or sometimes 300s
before continuing which really slows down transfers.

This will happen especially if --transfers is large, so this mode isn't
recommended except for compatibility or investigating problems.

--dropbox-batch-mode sync

In this mode rclone will batch up uploads to the size specified by
--dropbox-batch-size and commit them together.

Using this mode means you can use a much higher --transfers parameter
(32 or 64 works fine) without receiving too_many_requests errors.

This mode ensures full data integrity.

Note that there may be a pause when quitting rclone while rclone
finishes up the last batch using this mode.

--dropbox-batch-mode async

In this mode rclone will batch up uploads to the size specified by
--dropbox-batch-size and commit them together.

However it will not wait for the status of the batch to be returned to
the caller. This means rclone can use a much bigger batch size (much
bigger than --transfers), at the cost of not being able to check the
status of the upload.

This provides the maximum possible upload speed especially with lots of
small files, however rclone can't check the file got uploaded properly
using this mode.

If you are using this mode then using "rclone check" after the transfer
completes is recommended. Or you could do an initial transfer with
--dropbox-batch-mode async then do a final transfer with
--dropbox-batch-mode sync (the default).

Note that there may be a pause when quitting rclone while rclone
finishes up the last batch using this mode.

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to dropbox (Dropbox).

--dropbox-client-id

OAuth Client Id.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

-   Config: client_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--dropbox-client-secret

OAuth Client Secret.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

-   Config: client_secret
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_CLIENT_SECRET
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to dropbox (Dropbox).

--dropbox-token

OAuth Access Token as a JSON blob.

Properties:

-   Config: token
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_TOKEN
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--dropbox-auth-url

Auth server URL.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

Properties:

-   Config: auth_url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_AUTH_URL
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--dropbox-token-url

Token server url.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

Properties:

-   Config: token_url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_TOKEN_URL
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--dropbox-chunk-size

Upload chunk size (< 150Mi).

Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of this size.

Note that chunks are buffered in memory (one at a time) so rclone can
deal with retries. Setting this larger will increase the speed slightly
(at most 10% for 128 MiB in tests) at the cost of using more memory. It
can be set smaller if you are tight on memory.

Properties:

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 48Mi

--dropbox-impersonate

Impersonate this user when using a business account.

Note that if you want to use impersonate, you should make sure this flag
is set when running "rclone config" as this will cause rclone to request
the "members.read" scope which it won't normally. This is needed to
lookup a members email address into the internal ID that dropbox uses in
the API.

Using the "members.read" scope will require a Dropbox Team Admin to
approve during the OAuth flow.

You will have to use your own App (setting your own client_id and
client_secret) to use this option as currently rclone's default set of
permissions doesn't include "members.read". This can be added once v1.55
or later is in use everywhere.

Properties:

-   Config: impersonate
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_IMPERSONATE
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--dropbox-shared-files

Instructs rclone to work on individual shared files.

In this mode rclone's features are extremely limited - only list (ls,
lsl, etc.) operations and read operations (e.g. downloading) are
supported in this mode. All other operations will be disabled.

Properties:

-   Config: shared_files
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_SHARED_FILES
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--dropbox-shared-folders

Instructs rclone to work on shared folders.

When this flag is used with no path only the List operation is supported
and all available shared folders will be listed. If you specify a path
the first part will be interpreted as the name of shared folder. Rclone
will then try to mount this shared to the root namespace. On success
shared folder rclone proceeds normally. The shared folder is now pretty
much a normal folder and all normal operations are supported.

Note that we don't unmount the shared folder afterwards so the
--dropbox-shared-folders can be omitted after the first use of a
particular shared folder.

Properties:

-   Config: shared_folders
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_SHARED_FOLDERS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--dropbox-batch-mode

Upload file batching sync|async|off.

This sets the batch mode used by rclone.

For full info see the main docs

This has 3 possible values

-   off - no batching
-   sync - batch uploads and check completion (default)
-   async - batch upload and don't check completion

Rclone will close any outstanding batches when it exits which may make a
delay on quit.

Properties:

-   Config: batch_mode
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_MODE
-   Type: string
-   Default: "sync"

--dropbox-batch-size

Max number of files in upload batch.

This sets the batch size of files to upload. It has to be less than
1000.

By default this is 0 which means rclone which calculate the batch size
depending on the setting of batch_mode.

-   batch_mode: async - default batch_size is 100
-   batch_mode: sync - default batch_size is the same as --transfers
-   batch_mode: off - not in use

Rclone will close any outstanding batches when it exits which may make a
delay on quit.

Setting this is a great idea if you are uploading lots of small files as
it will make them a lot quicker. You can use --transfers 32 to maximise
throughput.

Properties:

-   Config: batch_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_SIZE
-   Type: int
-   Default: 0

--dropbox-batch-timeout

Max time to allow an idle upload batch before uploading.

If an upload batch is idle for more than this long then it will be
uploaded.

The default for this is 0 which means rclone will choose a sensible
default based on the batch_mode in use.

-   batch_mode: async - default batch_timeout is 500ms
-   batch_mode: sync - default batch_timeout is 10s
-   batch_mode: off - not in use

Properties:

-   Config: batch_timeout
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_TIMEOUT
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 0s

--dropbox-batch-commit-timeout

Max time to wait for a batch to finish comitting

Properties:

-   Config: batch_commit_timeout
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_COMMIT_TIMEOUT
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 10m0s

--dropbox-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: Slash,BackSlash,Del,RightSpace,InvalidUtf8,Dot

Limitations

Note that Dropbox is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are some file names such as thumbs.db which Dropbox can't store.
There is a full list of them in the "Ignored Files" section of this
document. Rclone will issue an error message
File name disallowed - not uploading if it attempts to upload one of
those file names, but the sync won't fail.

Some errors may occur if you try to sync copyright-protected files
because Dropbox has its own copyright detector that prevents this sort
of file being downloaded. This will return the error
ERROR : /path/to/your/file: Failed to copy: failed to open source object: path/restricted_content/.

If you have more than 10,000 files in a directory then
rclone purge dropbox:dir will return the error
Failed to purge: There are too many files involved in this operation. As
a work-around do an rclone delete dropbox:dir followed by an
rclone rmdir dropbox:dir.

When using rclone link you'll need to set --expire if using a
non-personal account otherwise the visibility may not be correct. (Note
that --expire isn't supported on personal accounts). See the forum
discussion and the dropbox SDK issue.

Get your own Dropbox App ID

When you use rclone with Dropbox in its default configuration you are
using rclone's App ID. This is shared between all the rclone users.

Here is how to create your own Dropbox App ID for rclone:

1.  Log into the Dropbox App console with your Dropbox Account (It need
    not to be the same account as the Dropbox you want to access)

2.  Choose an API => Usually this should be Dropbox API

3.  Choose the type of access you want to use => Full Dropbox or
    App Folder

4.  Name your App. The app name is global, so you can't use rclone for
    example

5.  Click the button Create App

6.  Switch to the Permissions tab. Enable at least the following
    permissions: account_info.read, files.metadata.write,
    files.content.write, files.content.read, sharing.write. The
    files.metadata.read and sharing.read checkboxes will be marked too.
    Click Submit

7.  Switch to the Settings tab. Fill OAuth2 - Redirect URIs as
    http://localhost:53682/

8.  Find the App key and App secret values on the Settings tab. Use
    these values in rclone config to add a new remote or edit an
    existing remote. The App key setting corresponds to client_id in
    rclone config, the App secret corresponds to client_secret

Enterprise File Fabric

This backend supports Storage Made Easy's Enterprise File Fabric™ which
provides a software solution to integrate and unify File and Object
Storage accessible through a global file system.

Configuration

The initial setup for the Enterprise File Fabric backend involves
getting a token from the the Enterprise File Fabric which you need to do
in your browser. rclone config walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Enterprise File Fabric
       \ "filefabric"
    [snip]
    Storage> filefabric
    ** See help for filefabric backend at: https://rclone.org/filefabric/ **

    URL of the Enterprise File Fabric to connect to
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
     1 / Storage Made Easy US
       \ "https://storagemadeeasy.com"
     2 / Storage Made Easy EU
       \ "https://eu.storagemadeeasy.com"
     3 / Connect to your Enterprise File Fabric
       \ "https://yourfabric.smestorage.com"
    url> https://yourfabric.smestorage.com/
    ID of the root folder
    Leave blank normally.

    Fill in to make rclone start with directory of a given ID.

    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    root_folder_id> 
    Permanent Authentication Token

    A Permanent Authentication Token can be created in the Enterprise File
    Fabric, on the users Dashboard under Security, there is an entry
    you'll see called "My Authentication Tokens". Click the Manage button
    to create one.

    These tokens are normally valid for several years.

    For more info see: https://docs.storagemadeeasy.com/organisationcloud/api-tokens

    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    permanent_token> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    Edit advanced config? (y/n)
    y) Yes
    n) No (default)
    y/n> n
    Remote config
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = filefabric
    url = https://yourfabric.smestorage.com/
    permanent_token = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK (default)
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your Enterprise File Fabric

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Enterprise File Fabric

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Enterprise File Fabric directory called
backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Modified time and hashes

The Enterprise File Fabric allows modification times to be set on files
accurate to 1 second. These will be used to detect whether objects need
syncing or not.

The Enterprise File Fabric does not support any data hashes at this
time.

Restricted filename characters

The default restricted characters set will be replaced.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

Empty files

Empty files aren't supported by the Enterprise File Fabric. Rclone will
therefore upload an empty file as a single space with a mime type of
application/vnd.rclone.empty.file and files with that mime type are
treated as empty.

Root folder ID

You can set the root_folder_id for rclone. This is the directory
(identified by its Folder ID) that rclone considers to be the root of
your Enterprise File Fabric.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct
root to use itself.

However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.

In order to do this you will have to find the Folder ID of the directory
you wish rclone to display. These aren't displayed in the web interface,
but you can use rclone lsf to find them, for example

    $ rclone lsf --dirs-only -Fip --csv filefabric:
    120673758,Burnt PDFs/
    120673759,My Quick Uploads/
    120673755,My Syncs/
    120673756,My backups/
    120673757,My contacts/
    120673761,S3 Storage/

The ID for "S3 Storage" would be 120673761.

FTP

FTP is the File Transfer Protocol. Rclone FTP support is provided using
the github.com/jlaffaye/ftp package.

Limitations of Rclone's FTP backend

Paths are specified as remote:path. If the path does not begin with a /
it is relative to the home directory of the user. An empty path remote:
refers to the user's home directory.

Configuration

To create an FTP configuration named remote, run

    rclone config

Rclone config guides you through an interactive setup process. A minimal
rclone FTP remote definition only requires host, username and password.
For an anonymous FTP server, use anonymous as username and your email
address as password.

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password

    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

To see all directories in the home directory of remote

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:path/to/directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:path/to/directory

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote directory, deleting any excess
files in the directory.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:directory

Example without a config file

    rclone lsf :ftp: --ftp-host=speedtest.tele2.net --ftp-user=anonymous --ftp-pass=`rclone obscure dummy`

Implicit TLS

Rlone FTP supports implicit FTP over TLS servers (FTPS). This has to be
enabled in the FTP backend config for the remote, or with --ftp-tls. The
default FTPS port is 990, not 21 and can be set with --ftp-port.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

File names cannot end with the following characters. Repacement is
limited to the last character in a file name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠

Not all FTP servers can have all characters in file names, for example:

  FTP Server    Forbidden characters
  ------------ ----------------------
  proftpd                *
  pureftpd             \ [ ]

This backend's interactive configuration wizard provides a selection of
sensible encoding settings for major FTP servers: ProFTPd, PureFTPd,
VsFTPd. Just hit a selection number when prompted.

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to ftp (FTP Connection).

--ftp-host

        -   PureFTPd can't handle '[]' or '*' in file names
    -   "Ctl,LeftPeriod,Slash"
        -   VsFTPd can't handle file names starting with dot

Limitations

FTP servers acting as rclone remotes must support passive mode. The mode
cannot be configured as passive is the only supported one. Rclone's FTP
implementation is not compatible with active mode as the library it uses
doesn't support it. This will likely never be supported due to security
concerns.

Rclone's FTP backend does not support any checksums but can compare file
sizes.

rclone about is not supported by the FTP backend. Backends without this
capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy
mfs (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.

See List of backends that do not support rclone about See rclone about

The implementation of : --dump headers, --dump bodies, --dump auth for
debugging isn't the same as for rclone HTTP based backends - it has less
fine grained control.

--timeout isn't supported (but --contimeout is).

--bind isn't supported.

Rclone's FTP backend could support server-side move but does not at
present.

The ftp_proxy environment variable is not currently supported.

Modified time

File modification time (timestamps) is supported to 1 second resolution
for major FTP servers: ProFTPd, PureFTPd, VsFTPd, and FileZilla FTP
server. The VsFTPd server has non-standard implementation of time
related protocol commands and needs a special configuration setting:
writing_mdtm = true.

Support for precise file time with other FTP servers varies depending on
what protocol extensions they advertise. If all the MLSD, MDTM and MFTM
extensions are present, rclone will use them together to provide precise
time. Otherwise the times you see on the FTP server through rclone are
those of the last file upload.

You can use the following command to check whether rclone can use
precise time with your FTP server:
rclone backend features your_ftp_remote: (the trailing colon is
important). Look for the number in the line tagged by Precision
designating the remote time precision expressed as nanoseconds. A value
of 1000000000 means that file time precision of 1 second is available. A
value of 3153600000000000000 (or another large number) means
"unsupported".

Google Cloud Storage

Paths are specified as remote:bucket (or remote: for the lsd command.)
You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. remote:bucket/path/to/dir.

Configuration

The initial setup for google cloud storage involves getting a token from
Google Cloud Storage which you need to do in your browser. rclone config
walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code. This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it
may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

This remote is called remote and can now be used like this

See all the buckets in your project

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:bucket

Service Account support

You can set up rclone with Google Cloud Storage in an unattended mode,
i.e. not tied to a specific end-user Google account. This is useful when
you want to synchronise files onto machines that don't have actively
logged-in users, for example build machines.

To get credentials for Google Cloud Platform IAM Service Accounts,
please head to the Service Account section of the Google Developer
Console. Service Accounts behave just like normal User permissions in
Google Cloud Storage ACLs, so you can limit their access (e.g. make them
read only). After creating an account, a JSON file containing the
Service Account's credentials will be downloaded onto your machines.
These credentials are what rclone will use for authentication.

To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path to
your Service Account credentials at the service_account_file prompt and
rclone won't use the browser based authentication flow. If you'd rather
stuff the contents of the credentials file into the rclone config file,
you can set service_account_credentials with the actual contents of the
file instead, or set the equivalent environment variable.

Anonymous Access

For downloads of objects that permit public access you can configure
rclone to use anonymous access by setting anonymous to true. With
unauthorized access you can't write or create files but only read or
list those buckets and objects that have public read access.

Application Default Credentials

If no other source of credentials is provided, rclone will fall back to
Application Default Credentials this is useful both when you already
have configured authentication for your developer account, or in
production when running on a google compute host. Note that if running
in docker, you may need to run additional commands on your google
compute machine - see this page.

Note that in the case application default credentials are used, there is
no need to explicitly configure a project number.

--fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

Custom upload headers

You can set custom upload headers with the --header-upload flag. Google
Cloud Storage supports the headers as described in the working with
metadata documentation

-   Cache-Control
-   Content-Disposition
-   Content-Encoding
-   Content-Language
-   Content-Type
-   X-Goog-Storage-Class
-   X-Goog-Meta-

Eg --header-upload "Content-Type text/potato"

Note that the last of these is for setting custom metadata in the form
--header-upload "x-goog-meta-key: value"

Modification time

Google Cloud Storage stores md5sum natively. Google's gsutil tool stores
modification time with one-second precision as goog-reserved-file-mtime
in file metadata.

To ensure compatibility with gsutil, rclone stores modification time in
2 separate metadata entries. mtime uses RFC3339 format with
one-nanosecond precision. goog-reserved-file-mtime uses Unix timestamp
format with one-second precision. To get modification time from object
metadata, rclone reads the metadata in the following order: mtime,
goog-reserved-file-mtime, object updated time.

Note that rclone's default modify window is 1ns. Files uploaded by
gsutil only contain timestamps with one-second precision. If you use
rclone to sync files previously uploaded by gsutil, rclone will attempt
to update modification time for all these files. To avoid these possibly
unnecessary updates, use --modify-window 1s.

Restricted filename characters

  Character    Value   Replacement

rclone mount or use policy mfs (most free space) as a member of an
rclone union remote.

See List of backends that do not support rclone about See rclone about

Google Drive

Paths are specified as drive:path

Drive paths may be as deep as required, e.g.
drive:directory/subdirectory.

Configuration

The initial setup for drive involves getting a token from Google drive
which you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through
it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config

       \ "drive.file"
       / Allows read and write access to the Application Data folder.
     4 | This is not visible in the drive website.
       \ "drive.appfolder"

    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code. This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and it may
require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your drive

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your drive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a drive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Scopes

Rclone allows you to select which scope you would like for rclone to
use. This changes what type of token is granted to rclone. The scopes
are defined here.

The scope are

drive

This is the default scope and allows full access to all files, except
for the Application Data Folder (see below).

Choose this one if you aren't sure.

drive.readonly

This allows read only access to all files. Files may be listed and
downloaded but not uploaded, renamed or deleted.

drive.file

With this scope rclone can read/view/modify only those files and folders
it creates.

So if you uploaded files to drive via the web interface (or any other
means) they will not be visible to rclone.

This can be useful if you are using rclone to backup data and you want
to be sure confidential data on your drive is not visible to rclone.

Files created with this scope are visible in the web interface.

drive.appfolder

This gives rclone its own private area to store files. Rclone will not
be able to see any other files on your drive and you won't be able to
see rclone's files from the web interface either.

drive.metadata.readonly

This allows read only access to file names only. It does not allow
rclone to download or upload data, or rename or delete files or
directories.

Root folder ID

You can set the root_folder_id for rclone. This is the directory
(identified by its Folder ID) that rclone considers to be the root of
your drive.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct
root to use itself.

However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy or to access data within the "Computers" tab on the drive web
interface (where files from Google's Backup and Sync desktop program
go).

In order to do this you will have to find the Folder ID of the directory
you wish rclone to display. This will be the last segment of the URL
when you open the relevant folder in the drive web interface.

So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh
in the browser, then you use 1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh as the
root_folder_id in the config.

NB folders under the "Computers" tab seem to be read only (drive gives a
500 error) when using rclone.

There doesn't appear to be an API to discover the folder IDs of the
"Computers" tab - please contact us if you know otherwise!

Note also that rclone can't access any data under the "Backups" tab on
the google drive web interface yet.

Service Account support

You can set up rclone with Google Drive in an unattended mode, i.e. not
tied to a specific end-user Google account. This is useful when you want
to synchronise files onto machines that don't have actively logged-in
users, for example build machines.

To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path to
your Service Account credentials at the service_account_file prompt
during rclone config and rclone won't use the browser based
authentication flow. If you'd rather stuff the contents of the
credentials file into the rclone config file, you can set
service_account_credentials with the actual contents of the file
instead, or set the equivalent environment variable.

Use case - Google Apps/G-suite account and individual Drive

Let's say that you are the administrator of a Google Apps (old) or
G-suite account. The goal is to store data on an individual's Drive
account, who IS a member of the domain. We'll call the domain
example.com, and the user foo@example.com.

There's a few steps we need to go through to accomplish this:

1. Create a service account for example.com

-   To create a service account and obtain its credentials, go to the
    Google Developer Console.
-   You must have a project - create one if you don't.
-   Then go to "IAM & admin" -> "Service Accounts".
-   Use the "Create Credentials" button. Fill in "Service account name"
    with something that identifies your client. "Role" can be empty.
-   Tick "Furnish a new private key" - select "Key type JSON".
-   Tick "Enable G Suite Domain-wide Delegation". This option makes
    "impersonation" possible, as documented here: Delegating domain-wide
    authority to the service account
-   These credentials are what rclone will use for authentication. If
    you ever need to remove access, press the "Delete service account
    key" button.

2. Allowing API access to example.com Google Drive

-   Go to example.com's admin console
-   Go into "Security" (or use the search bar)
-   Select "Show more" and then "Advanced settings"
-   Select "Manage API client access" in the "Authentication" section
-   In the "Client Name" field enter the service account's "Client ID" -
    this can be found in the Developer Console under "IAM & Admin" ->
    "Service Accounts", then "View Client ID" for the newly created
    service account. It is a ~21 character numerical string.
-   In the next field, "One or More API Scopes", enter
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive to grant access to Google
    Drive specifically.

3. Configure rclone, assuming a new install

    rclone config

    n/s/q> n         # New
    name>gdrive      # Gdrive is an example name
    Storage>         # Select the number shown for Google Drive
    client_id>       # Can be left blank
    client_secret>   # Can be left blank
    scope>           # Select your scope, 1 for example
    root_folder_id>  # Can be left blank
    service_account_file> /home/foo/myJSONfile.json # This is where the JSON file goes!
    y/n>             # Auto config, n

4. Verify that it's working

-   rclone -v --drive-impersonate foo@example.com lsf gdrive:backup
-   The arguments do:
    -   -v - verbose logging
    -   --drive-impersonate foo@example.com - this is what does the
        magic, pretending to be user foo.
    -   lsf - list files in a parsing friendly way
    -   gdrive:backup - use the remote called gdrive, work in the folder
        named backup.

Note: in case you configured a specific root folder on gdrive and rclone
is unable to access the contents of that folder when using
--drive-impersonate, do this instead: - in the gdrive web interface,
share your root folder with the user/email of the new Service Account
you created/selected at step #1 - use rclone without specifying the
--drive-impersonate option, like this: rclone -v lsf gdrive:backup

Shared drives (team drives)

If you want to configure the remote to point to a Google Shared Drive
(previously known as Team Drives) then answer y to the question
Configure this as a Shared Drive (Team Drive)?.

This will fetch the list of Shared Drives from google and allow you to
configure which one you want to use. You can also type in a Shared Drive
ID if you prefer.

For example:

    Configure this as a Shared Drive (Team Drive)?
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    Fetching Shared Drive list...
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
     1 / Rclone Test
       \ "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
     2 / Rclone Test 2
       \ "yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"
     3 / Rclone Test 3
       \ "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
    Enter a Shared Drive ID> 1
    --------------------
    [remote]
    client_id =
    client_secret =
    token = {"AccessToken":"xxxx.x.xxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","RefreshToken":"1/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","Expiry":"2014-03-16T13:57:58.955387075Z","Extra":null}
    team_drive = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

--fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

It does this by combining multiple list calls into a single API request.

This works by combining many '%s' in parents filters into one
expression. To list the contents of directories a, b and c, the
following requests will be send by the regular List function:

    trashed=false and 'a' in parents
    trashed=false and 'b' in parents
    trashed=false and 'c' in parents

These can now be combined into a single request:

    trashed=false and ('a' in parents or 'b' in parents or 'c' in parents)

The implementation of ListR will put up to 50 parents filters into one
request. It will use the --checkers value to specify the number of
requests to run in parallel.

In tests, these batch requests were up to 20x faster than the regular
method. Running the following command against different sized folders
gives:

    rclone lsjson -vv -R --checkers=6 gdrive:folder

small folder (220 directories, 700 files):

-   without --fast-list: 38s
-   with --fast-list: 10s

large folder (10600 directories, 39000 files):

-   without --fast-list: 22:05 min
-   with --fast-list: 58s

Modified time

Google drive stores modification times accurate to 1 ms.

Restricted filename characters

Only Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

In contrast to other backends, / can also be used in names and . or ..
are valid names.

Revisions

Google drive stores revisions of files. When you upload a change to an
existing file to google drive using rclone it will create a new revision
of that file.

Revisions follow the standard google policy which at time of writing was

-   They are deleted after 30 days or 100 revisions (whatever comes
    first).
-   They do not count towards a user storage quota.

Deleting files

By default rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files.
If deleting them permanently is required then use the
--drive-use-trash=false flag, or set the equivalent environment
variable.

Shortcuts

In March 2020 Google introduced a new feature in Google Drive called
drive shortcuts (API). These will (by September 2020) replace the
ability for files or folders to be in multiple folders at once.

Shortcuts are files that link to other files on Google Drive somewhat
like a symlink in unix, except they point to the underlying file data
(e.g. the inode in unix terms) so they don't break if the source is
renamed or moved about.

Be default rclone treats these as follows.

For shortcuts pointing to files:

-   When listing a file shortcut appears as the destination file.
-   When downloading the contents of the destination file is downloaded.
-   When updating shortcut file with a non shortcut file, the shortcut
    is removed then a new file is uploaded in place of the shortcut.
-   When server-side moving (renaming) the shortcut is renamed, not the
    destination file.
-   When server-side copying the shortcut is copied, not the contents of
    the shortcut. (unless --drive-copy-shortcut-content is in use in
    which case the contents of the shortcut gets copied).
-   When deleting the shortcut is deleted not the linked file.
-   When setting the modification time, the modification time of the
    linked file will be set.

For shortcuts pointing to folders:

-   When listing the shortcut appears as a folder and that folder will
    contain the contents of the linked folder appear (including any sub
    folders)
-   When downloading the contents of the linked folder and sub contents
    are downloaded
-   When uploading to a shortcut folder the file will be placed in the
    linked folder
-   When server-side moving (renaming) the shortcut is renamed, not the
    destination folder
-   When server-side copying the contents of the linked folder is
    copied, not the shortcut.
-   When deleting with rclone rmdir or rclone purge the shortcut is
    deleted not the linked folder.
-   NB When deleting with rclone remove or rclone mount the contents of
    the linked folder will be deleted.

The rclone backend command can be used to create shortcuts.

Shortcuts can be completely ignored with the --drive-skip-shortcuts flag
or the corresponding skip_shortcuts configuration setting.

Emptying trash

If you wish to empty your trash you can use the rclone cleanup remote:
command which will permanently delete all your trashed files. This
command does not take any path arguments.

Note that Google Drive takes some time (minutes to days) to empty the
trash even though the command returns within a few seconds. No output is
echoed, so there will be no confirmation even using -v or -vv.

Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the rclone about remote: command
which will display your usage limit (quota), the usage in Google Drive,
the size of all files in the Trash and the space used by other Google
services such as Gmail. This command does not take any path arguments.

Import/Export of google documents

Google documents can be exported from and uploaded to Google Drive.

When rclone downloads a Google doc it chooses a format to download
depending upon the --drive-export-formats setting. By default the export
formats are docx,xlsx,pptx,svg which are a sensible default for an
editable document.

When choosing a format, rclone runs down the list provided in order and
chooses the first file format the doc can be exported as from the list.
If the file can't be exported to a format on the formats list, then
rclone will choose a format from the default list.

If you prefer an archive copy then you might use
--drive-export-formats pdf, or if you prefer openoffice/libreoffice
formats you might use --drive-export-formats ods,odt,odp.

Note that rclone adds the extension to the google doc, so if it is
called My Spreadsheet on google docs, it will be exported as
My Spreadsheet.xlsx or My Spreadsheet.pdf etc.

When importing files into Google Drive, rclone will convert all files
with an extension in --drive-import-formats to their associated document
type. rclone will not convert any files by default, since the conversion
is lossy process.

The conversion must result in a file with the same extension when the
--drive-export-formats rules are applied to the uploaded document.

Here are some examples for allowed and prohibited conversions.

  export-formats   import-formats   Upload Ext   Document Ext   Allowed
  ---------------- ---------------- ------------ -------------- ---------
  odt              odt              odt          odt            Yes
  odt              docx,odt         odt          odt            Yes
                   docx             docx         docx           Yes
                   odt              odt          docx           No
  odt,docx         docx,odt         docx         odt            No
  docx,odt         docx,odt         docx         docx           Yes
  docx,odt         docx,odt         odt          docx           No

This limitation can be disabled by specifying
--drive-allow-import-name-change. When using this flag, rclone can
convert multiple files types resulting in the same document type at
once, e.g. with --drive-import-formats docx,odt,txt, all files having
these extension would result in a document represented as a docx file.
This brings the additional risk of overwriting a document, if multiple
files have the same stem. Many rclone operations will not handle this
name change in any way. They assume an equal name when copying files and
might copy the file again or delete them when the name changes.

Here are the possible export extensions with their corresponding mime
types. Most of these can also be used for importing, but there more that
are not listed here. Some of these additional ones might only be
available when the operating system provides the correct MIME type
entries.

This list can be changed by Google Drive at any time and might not
represent the currently available conversions.

-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_ALLOW_IMPORT_NAME_CHANGE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--drive-use-created-date

Use file created date instead of modified date.

Useful when downloading data and you want the creation date used in
place of the last modified date.

WARNING: This flag may have some unexpected consequences.

When uploading to your drive all files will be overwritten unless they
haven't been modified since their creation. And the inverse will occur
while downloading. This side effect can be avoided by using the
"--checksum" flag.

This feature was implemented to retain photos capture date as recorded
by google photos. You will first need to check the "Create a Google
Photos folder" option in your google drive settings. You can then copy
or move the photos locally and use the date the image was taken
(created) set as the modification date.

Properties:

-   Config: use_created_date
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_CREATED_DATE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--drive-use-shared-date

Use date file was shared instead of modified date.

Note that, as with "--drive-use-created-date", this flag may have
unexpected consequences when uploading/downloading files.

If both this flag and "--drive-use-created-date" are set, the created
date is used.

Properties:

-   Config: use_shared_date
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_SHARED_DATE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--drive-list-chunk

Size of listing chunk 100-1000, 0 to disable.

Properties:

-   Config: list_chunk
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_LIST_CHUNK
-   Type: int
-   Default: 1000

--drive-impersonate

Impersonate this user when using a service account.

Properties:

-   Config: impersonate
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_IMPERSONATE
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--drive-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload.

Properties:

-   Config: upload_cutoff
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 8Mi

--drive-chunk-size

Upload chunk size.

Must a power of 2 >= 256k.

Making this larger will improve performance, but note that each chunk is
buffered in memory one per transfer.

Reducing this will reduce memory usage but decrease performance.

Properties:

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 8Mi

--drive-acknowledge-abuse

Set to allow files which return cannotDownloadAbusiveFile to be
downloaded.

If downloading a file returns the error "This file has been identified
as malware or spam and cannot be downloaded" with the error code
"cannotDownloadAbusiveFile" then supply this flag to rclone to indicate
you acknowledge the risks of downloading the file and rclone will
download it anyway.

Properties:

-   Config: acknowledge_abuse
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_ACKNOWLEDGE_ABUSE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--drive-keep-revision-forever

Keep new head revision of each file forever.

Properties:

-   Config: keep_revision_forever
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_KEEP_REVISION_FOREVER
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--drive-size-as-quota

Show sizes as storage quota usage, not actual size.

Show the size of a file as the storage quota used. This is the current
version plus any older versions that have been set to keep forever.

WARNING: This flag may have some unexpected consequences.

It is not recommended to set this flag in your config - the recommended
usage is using the flag form --drive-size-as-quota when doing rclone
ls/lsl/lsf/lsjson/etc only.

If you do use this flag for syncing (not recommended) then you will need
to use --ignore size also.

Properties:

-   Config: size_as_quota
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_SIZE_AS_QUOTA
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--drive-v2-download-min-size

If Object's are greater, use drive v2 API to download.

Properties:

-   Config: v2_download_min_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_V2_DOWNLOAD_MIN_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: off

--drive-pacer-min-sleep

Minimum time to sleep between API calls.

Properties:

-   Config: pacer_min_sleep
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_PACER_MIN_SLEEP
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 100ms

--drive-pacer-burst

Number of API calls to allow without sleeping.

Properties:

-   Config: pacer_burst
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_PACER_BURST
-   Type: int
-   Default: 100

--drive-server-side-across-configs

Allow server-side operations (e.g. copy) to work across different drive
configs.

This can be useful if you wish to do a server-side copy between two
different Google drives. Note that this isn't enabled by default because
it isn't easy to tell if it will work between any two configurations.

Properties:

-   Config: server_side_across_configs
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_SERVER_SIDE_ACROSS_CONFIGS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--drive-disable-http2

Disable drive using http2.

There is currently an unsolved issue with the google drive backend and
HTTP/2. HTTP/2 is therefore disabled by default for the drive backend
but can be re-enabled here. When the issue is solved this flag will be
removed.

See: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3631

Properties:

-   Config: disable_http2
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_DISABLE_HTTP2
-   Type: bool
-   Default: true

--drive-stop-on-upload-limit

Make upload limit errors be fatal.

At the time of writing it is only possible to upload 750 GiB of data to
Google Drive a day (this is an undocumented limit). When this limit is
reached Google Drive produces a slightly different error message. When
this flag is set it causes these errors to be fatal. These will stop the
in-progress sync.

Note that this detection is relying on error message strings which
Google don't document so it may break in the future.

See: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3857

Properties:

-   Config: stop_on_upload_limit
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_STOP_ON_UPLOAD_LIMIT
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--drive-stop-on-download-limit

Make download limit errors be fatal.

At the time of writing it is only possible to download 10 TiB of data
from Google Drive a day (this is an undocumented limit). When this limit
is reached Google Drive produces a slightly different error message.
When this flag is set it causes these errors to be fatal. These will
stop the in-progress sync.

Note that this detection is relying on error message strings which
Google don't document so it may break in the future.

Properties:

-   Config: stop_on_download_limit
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_STOP_ON_DOWNLOAD_LIMIT
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--drive-skip-shortcuts

If set skip shortcut files.

Normally rclone dereferences shortcut files making them appear as if
they are the original file (see the shortcuts section). If this flag is
set then rclone will ignore shortcut files completely.

Properties:

-   Config: skip_shortcuts
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_SKIP_SHORTCUTS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--drive-skip-dangling-shortcuts

If set skip dangling shortcut files.

If this is set then rclone will not show any dangling shortcuts in
listings.

Properties:

-   Config: skip_dangling_shortcuts
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_SKIP_DANGLING_SHORTCUTS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--drive-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: InvalidUtf8

Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the drive backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the "rclone backend" command for more info on how to pass options
and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
backend/command.

get

Get command for fetching the drive config parameters

    rclone backend get remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This is a get command which will be used to fetch the various drive
config parameters

Usage Examples:

    rclone backend get drive: [-o service_account_file] [-o chunk_size]
    rclone rc backend/command command=get fs=drive: [-o service_account_file] [-o chunk_size]

Options:

-   "chunk_size": show the current upload chunk size
-   "service_account_file": show the current service account file

set

Set command for updating the drive config parameters

    rclone backend set remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This is a set command which will be used to update the various drive
config parameters

Usage Examples:

    rclone backend set drive: [-o service_account_file=sa.json] [-o chunk_size=67108864]
    rclone rc backend/command command=set fs=drive: [-o service_account_file=sa.json] [-o chunk_size=67108864]

Options:

-   "chunk_size": update the current upload chunk size
-   "service_account_file": update the current service account file

shortcut

Create shortcuts from files or directories

    rclone backend shortcut remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command creates shortcuts from files or directories.

Usage:

    rclone backend shortcut drive: source_item destination_shortcut
    rclone backend shortcut drive: source_item -o target=drive2: destination_shortcut

In the first example this creates a shortcut from the "source_item"
which can be a file or a directory to the "destination_shortcut". The
"source_item" and the "destination_shortcut" should be relative paths
from "drive:"

In the second example this creates a shortcut from the "source_item"
relative to "drive:" to the "destination_shortcut" relative to
"drive2:". This may fail with a permission error if the user
authenticated with "drive2:" can't read files from "drive:".

Options:

-   "target": optional target remote for the shortcut destination

drives

List the Shared Drives available to this account

    rclone backend drives remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command lists the Shared Drives (Team Drives) available to this
account.

Usage:

    rclone backend [-o config] drives drive:

This will return a JSON list of objects like this

    [
        {
            "id": "0ABCDEF-01234567890",
            "kind": "drive#teamDrive",
            "name": "My Drive"
        },
        {
            "id": "0ABCDEFabcdefghijkl",
            "kind": "drive#teamDrive",
            "name": "Test Drive"
        }
    ]

With the -o config parameter it will output the list in a format
suitable for adding to a config file to make aliases for all the drives
found.

    [My Drive]
    type = alias
    remote = drive,team_drive=0ABCDEF-01234567890,root_folder_id=:

    [Test Drive]
    type = alias
    remote = drive,team_drive=0ABCDEFabcdefghijkl,root_folder_id=:

Adding this to the rclone config file will cause those team drives to be
accessible with the aliases shown. This may require manual editing of
the names.

untrash

Untrash files and directories

    rclone backend untrash remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command untrashes all the files and directories in the directory
passed in recursively.

Usage:

This takes an optional directory to trash which make this easier to use
via the API.

    rclone backend untrash drive:directory
    rclone backend -i untrash drive:directory subdir

Use the -i flag to see what would be restored before restoring it.

Result:

    {
        "Untrashed": 17,
        "Errors": 0
    }

copyid

Copy files by ID

    rclone backend copyid remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command copies files by ID

Usage:

    rclone backend copyid drive: ID path
    rclone backend copyid drive: ID1 path1 ID2 path2

It copies the drive file with ID given to the path (an rclone path which
will be passed internally to rclone copyto). The ID and path pairs can
be repeated.

The path should end with a / to indicate copy the file as named to this
directory. If it doesn't end with a / then the last path component will
be used as the file name.

If the destination is a drive backend then server-side copying will be
attempted if possible.

Use the -i flag to see what would be copied before copying.

Limitations

Drive has quite a lot of rate limiting. This causes rclone to be limited
to transferring about 2 files per second only. Individual files may be
transferred much faster at 100s of MiB/s but lots of small files can
take a long time.

Server side copies are also subject to a separate rate limit. If you see
User rate limit exceeded errors, wait at least 24 hours and retry. You
can disable server-side copies with --disable copy to download and
upload the files if you prefer.

Limitations of Google Docs

Google docs will appear as size -1 in rclone ls and as size 0 in
anything which uses the VFS layer, e.g. rclone mount, rclone serve.

This is because rclone can't find out the size of the Google docs
without downloading them.

Google docs will transfer correctly with rclone sync, rclone copy etc as
rclone knows to ignore the size when doing the transfer.

However an unfortunate consequence of this is that you may not be able
to download Google docs using rclone mount. If it doesn't work you will
get a 0 sized file. If you try again the doc may gain its correct size
and be downloadable. Whether it will work on not depends on the
application accessing the mount and the OS you are running - experiment
to find out if it does work for you!

Duplicated files

Sometimes, for no reason I've been able to track down, drive will
duplicate a file that rclone uploads. Drive unlike all the other remotes
can have duplicated files.

Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.

Use rclone dedupe to fix duplicated files.

Note that this isn't just a problem with rclone, even Google Photos on
Android duplicates files on drive sometimes.

Rclone appears to be re-copying files it shouldn't

The most likely cause of this is the duplicated file issue above - run
rclone dedupe and check your logs for duplicate object or directory
messages.

This can also be caused by a delay/caching on google drive's end when
comparing directory listings. Specifically with team drives used in
combination with --fast-list. Files that were uploaded recently may not
appear on the directory list sent to rclone when using --fast-list.

Waiting a moderate period of time between attempts (estimated to be
approximately 1 hour) and/or not using --fast-list both seem to be
effective in preventing the problem.

Making your own client_id

When you use rclone with Google drive in its default configuration you
are using rclone's client_id. This is shared between all the rclone
users. There is a global rate limit on the number of queries per second
that each client_id can do set by Google. rclone already has a high
quota and I will continue to make sure it is high enough by contacting
Google.

It is strongly recommended to use your own client ID as the default
rclone ID is heavily used. If you have multiple services running, it is
recommended to use an API key for each service. The default Google quota
is 10 transactions per second so it is recommended to stay under that
number as if you use more than that, it will cause rclone to rate limit
and make things slower.

Here is how to create your own Google Drive client ID for rclone:

1.  Log into the Google API Console with your Google account. It doesn't
    matter what Google account you use. (It need not be the same account
    as the Google Drive you want to access)

2.  Select a project or create a new project.

3.  Under "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" search for "Drive", and enable the
    "Google Drive API".

4.  Click "Credentials" in the left-side panel (not "Create
    credentials", which opens the wizard), then "Create credentials"

5.  If you already configured an "Oauth Consent Screen", then skip to
    the next step; if not, click on "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN" button
    (near the top right corner of the right panel), then select
    "External" and click on "CREATE"; on the next screen, enter an
    "Application name" ("rclone" is OK); enter "User Support Email"
    (your own email is OK); enter "Developer Contact Email" (your own
    email is OK); then click on "Save" (all other data is optional).
    Click again on "Credentials" on the left panel to go back to the
    "Credentials" screen.

(PS: if you are a GSuite user, you could also select "Internal" instead
of "External" above, but this has not been tested/documented so far).

6.  Click on the "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" button at the top of the screen,
    then select "OAuth client ID".

7.  Choose an application type of "Desktop app" and click "Create". (the
    default name is fine)

8.  It will show you a client ID and client secret. Make a note of
    these.

9.  Go to "Oauth consent screen" and press "Publish App"

10. Provide the noted client ID and client secret to rclone.

11. Click "OAuth consent screen", then click "PUBLISH APP" button and
    confirm, or add your account under "Test users".

Be aware that, due to the "enhanced security" recently introduced by
Google, you are theoretically expected to "submit your app for
verification" and then wait a few weeks(!) for their response; in
practice, you can go right ahead and use the client ID and client secret
with rclone, the only issue will be a very scary confirmation screen
shown when you connect via your browser for rclone to be able to get its
token-id (but as this only happens during the remote configuration, it's
not such a big deal).

(Thanks to @balazer on github for these instructions.)

Sometimes, creation of an OAuth consent in Google API Console fails due
to an error message “The request failed because changes to one of the
field of the resource is not supported”. As a convenient workaround, the
necessary Google Drive API key can be created on the Python Quickstart
page. Just push the Enable the Drive API button to receive the Client ID
and Secret. Note that it will automatically create a new project in the
API Console.

Google Photos

The rclone backend for Google Photos is a specialized backend for
transferring photos and videos to and from Google Photos.

NB The Google Photos API which rclone uses has quite a few limitations,
so please read the limitations section carefully to make sure it is
suitable for your use.

Configuration

The initial setup for google cloud storage involves getting a token from
Google Photos which you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks
you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Google Photos
       \ "google photos"
    [snip]
    Storage> google photos
    ** See help for google photos backend at: https://rclone.org/googlephotos/ **

    Google Application Client Id
    Leave blank normally.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    client_id> 
    Google Application Client Secret
    Leave blank normally.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    client_secret> 
    Set to make the Google Photos backend read only.

    If you choose read only then rclone will only request read only access
    to your photos, otherwise rclone will request full access.
    Enter a boolean value (true or false). Press Enter for the default ("false").
    read_only> 
    Edit advanced config? (y/n)
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> n
    Remote config
    Use auto config?
     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code

    *** IMPORTANT: All media items uploaded to Google Photos with rclone
    *** are stored in full resolution at original quality.  These uploads
    *** will count towards storage in your Google Account.

    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = google photos
    token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"2019-06-28T17:38:04.644930156+01:00"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code. This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this may
require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

This remote is called remote and can now be used like this

See all the albums in your photos

    rclone lsd remote:album

Make a new album

    rclone mkdir remote:album/newAlbum

List the contents of an album

    rclone ls remote:album/newAlbum

Sync /home/local/images to the Google Photos, removing any excess files
in the album.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/image remote:album/newAlbum

Layout

As Google Photos is not a general purpose cloud storage system the
backend is laid out to help you navigate it.

The directories under media show different ways of categorizing the
media. Each file will appear multiple times. So if you want to make a
backup of your google photos you might choose to backup
remote:media/by-month. (NB remote:media/by-day is rather slow at the
moment so avoid for syncing.)

Note that all your photos and videos will appear somewhere under media,
but they may not appear under album unless you've put them into albums.

    - feature
        - favorites
            - file1.jpg
            - file2.jpg

There are two writable parts of the tree, the upload directory and sub
directories of the album directory.

The upload directory is for uploading files you don't want to put into
albums. This will be empty to start with and will contain the files
you've uploaded for one rclone session only, becoming empty again when
you restart rclone. The use case for this would be if you have a load of
files you just want to once off dump into Google Photos. For repeated
syncing, uploading to album will work better.

Directories within the album directory are also writeable and you may
create new directories (albums) under album. If you copy files with a
directory hierarchy in there then rclone will create albums with the /
character in them. For example if you do

    rclone copy /path/to/images remote:album/images

and the images directory contains

    images
        - file1.jpg
        dir
            file2.jpg
        dir2
            dir3
                file3.jpg

Then rclone will create the following albums with the following files in

-   images
    -   file1.jpg
-   images/dir
    -   file2.jpg
-   images/dir2/dir3
    -   file3.jpg

This means that you can use the album path pretty much like a normal
filesystem and it is a good target for repeated syncing.

The shared-album directory shows albums shared with you or by you. This
is similar to the Sharing tab in the Google Photos web interface.

--gphotos-token-url

Token server url.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

Properties:

-   Config: token_url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_TOKEN_URL
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--gphotos-read-size

Set to read the size of media items.

Normally rclone does not read the size of media items since this takes
another transaction. This isn't necessary for syncing. However rclone
mount needs to know the size of files in advance of reading them, so
setting this flag when using rclone mount is recommended if you want to
read the media.

Properties:

-   Config: read_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_READ_SIZE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--gphotos-start-year

Year limits the photos to be downloaded to those which are uploaded
after the given year.

Properties:

-   Config: start_year
-   Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_START_YEAR
-   Type: int
-   Default: 2000

--gphotos-include-archived

Also view and download archived media.

By default, rclone does not request archived media. Thus, when syncing,
archived media is not visible in directory listings or transferred.

Note that media in albums is always visible and synced, no matter their
archive status.

With this flag, archived media are always visible in directory listings
and transferred.

Without this flag, archived media will not be visible in directory
listings and won't be transferred.

Properties:

-   Config: include_archived
-   Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_INCLUDE_ARCHIVED
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--gphotos-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: Slash,CrLf,InvalidUtf8,Dot

Limitations

Only images and videos can be uploaded. If you attempt to upload non
videos or images or formats that Google Photos doesn't understand,
rclone will upload the file, then Google Photos will give an error when
it is put turned into a media item.

Note that all media items uploaded to Google Photos through the API are
stored in full resolution at "original quality" and will count towards
your storage quota in your Google Account. The API does not offer a way
to upload in "high quality" mode..

rclone about is not supported by the Google Photos backend. Backends
without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount
or use policy mfs (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See List of backends that do not support rclone about See rclone about

Downloading Images

When Images are downloaded this strips EXIF location (according to the
docs and my tests). This is a limitation of the Google Photos API and is
covered by bug #112096115.

The current google API does not allow photos to be downloaded at
original resolution. This is very important if you are, for example,
relying on "Google Photos" as a backup of your photos. You will not be
able to use rclone to redownload original images. You could use 'google
takeout' to recover the original photos as a last resort

Downloading Videos

When videos are downloaded they are downloaded in a really compressed
version of the video compared to downloading it via the Google Photos
web interface. This is covered by bug #113672044.

Duplicates

If a file name is duplicated in a directory then rclone will add the
file ID into its name. So two files called file.jpg would then appear as
file {123456}.jpg and file {ABCDEF}.jpg (the actual IDs are a lot longer
alas!).

If you upload the same image (with the same binary data) twice then
Google Photos will deduplicate it. However it will retain the filename
from the first upload which may confuse rclone. For example if you
uploaded an image to upload then uploaded the same image to
album/my_album the filename of the image in album/my_album will be what
it was uploaded with initially, not what you uploaded it with to album.
In practise this shouldn't cause too many problems.

Modified time

The date shown of media in Google Photos is the creation date as
determined by the EXIF information, or the upload date if that is not
known.

This is not changeable by rclone and is not the modification date of the
media on local disk. This means that rclone cannot use the dates from
Google Photos for syncing purposes.

Size

The Google Photos API does not return the size of media. This means that
when syncing to Google Photos, rclone can only do a file existence
check.

It is possible to read the size of the media, but this needs an extra
HTTP HEAD request per media item so is very slow and uses up a lot of
transactions. This can be enabled with the --gphotos-read-size option or
the read_size = true config parameter.

If you want to use the backend with rclone mount you may need to enable
this flag (depending on your OS and application using the photos)
otherwise you may not be able to read media off the mount. You'll need
to experiment to see if it works for you without the flag.

Albums

Rclone can only upload files to albums it created. This is a limitation
of the Google Photos API.

Rclone can remove files it uploaded from albums it created only.

Deleting files

Rclone can remove files from albums it created, but note that the Google
Photos API does not allow media to be deleted permanently so this media
will still remain. See bug #109759781.

Rclone cannot delete files anywhere except under album.

Deleting albums

The Google Photos API does not support deleting albums - see bug
#135714733.

Hasher (EXPERIMENTAL)

Hasher is a special overlay backend to create remotes which handle
checksums for other remotes. It's main functions include: - Emulate hash
types unimplemented by backends - Cache checksums to help with slow
hashing of large local or (S)FTP files - Warm up checksum cache from
external SUM files

Getting started

To use Hasher, first set up the underlying remote following the
configuration instructions for that remote. You can also use a local
pathname instead of a remote. Check that your base remote is working.

Let's call the base remote myRemote:path here. Note that anything inside
myRemote:path will be handled by hasher and anything outside won't. This
means that if you are using a bucket based remote (S3, B2, Swift) then
you should put the bucket in the remote s3:bucket.

Now proceed to interactive or manual configuration.

Interactive configuration

Run rclone config:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> Hasher1
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Handle checksums for other remotes
       \ "hasher"
    [snip]
    Storage> hasher
    Remote to cache checksums for, like myremote:mypath.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    remote> myRemote:path
    Comma separated list of supported checksum types.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("md5,sha1").
    hashsums> md5
    Maximum time to keep checksums in cache. 0 = no cache, off = cache forever.
    max_age> off
    Edit advanced config? (y/n)
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> n
    Remote config
    --------------------
    [Hasher1]
    type = hasher
    remote = myRemote:path
    hashsums = md5
    max_age = off
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Manual configuration

Run rclone config path to see the path of current active config file,
usually YOURHOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf. Open it in your favorite
text editor, find section for the base remote and create new section for
hasher like in the following examples:

    [Hasher1]
    type = hasher
    remote = myRemote:path
    hashes = md5
    max_age = off

    [Hasher2]
    type = hasher
    remote = /local/path
    hashes = dropbox,sha1
    max_age = 24h

Hasher takes basically the following parameters: - remote is required, -
hashes is a comma separated list of supported checksums (by default
md5,sha1), - max_age - maximum time to keep a checksum value in the
cache, 0 will disable caching completely, off will cache "forever" (that
is until the files get changed).

Make sure the remote has : (colon) in. If you specify the remote without
a colon then rclone will use a local directory of that name. So if you
use a remote of /local/path then rclone will handle hashes for that
directory. If you use remote = name literally then rclone will put files
in a directory called name located under current directory.

Usage

Basic operations

Now you can use it as Hasher2:subdir/file instead of base remote. Hasher
will transparently update cache with new checksums when a file is fully
read or overwritten, like:

    rclone copy External:path/file Hasher:dest/path

    rclone cat Hasher:path/to/file > /dev/null

The way to refresh all cached checksums (even unsupported by the base
backend) for a subtree is to re-download all files in the subtree. For
example, use hashsum --download using any supported hashsum on the
command line (we just care to re-read):

    rclone hashsum MD5 --download Hasher:path/to/subtree > /dev/null

    rclone backend dump Hasher:path/to/subtree

You can print or drop hashsum cache using custom backend commands:

    rclone backend dump Hasher:dir/subdir

    rclone backend drop Hasher:

Pre-Seed from a SUM File

Hasher supports two backend commands: generic SUM file import and faster
but less consistent stickyimport.

    rclone backend import Hasher:dir/subdir SHA1 /path/to/SHA1SUM [--checkers 4]

Instead of SHA1 it can be any hash supported by the remote. The last
argument can point to either a local or an other-remote:path text file
in SUM format. The command will parse the SUM file, then walk down the
path given by the first argument, snapshot current fingerprints and fill
in the cache entries correspondingly. - Paths in the SUM file are
treated as relative to hasher:dir/subdir. - The command will not check
that supplied values are correct. You must know what you are doing. -
This is a one-time action. The SUM file will not get "attached" to the
remote. Cache entries can still be overwritten later, should the
object's fingerprint change. - The tree walk can take long depending on
the tree size. You can increase --checkers to make it faster. Or use
stickyimport if you don't care about fingerprints and consistency.

    rclone backend stickyimport hasher:path/to/data sha1 remote:/path/to/sum.sha1

stickyimport is similar to import but works much faster because it does
not need to stat existing files and skips initial tree walk. Instead of
binding cache entries to file fingerprints it creates sticky entries
bound to the file name alone ignoring size, modification time etc. Such
hash entries can be replaced only by purge, delete, backend drop or by
full re-read/re-write of the files.

Implementation details (advanced)

This section explains how various rclone operations work on a hasher
remote.

Disclaimer. This section describes current implementation which can
change in future rclone versions!.

Hashsum command

The rclone hashsum (or md5sum or sha1sum) command will:

1.  if requested hash is supported by lower level, just pass it.
2.  if object size is below auto_size then download object and calculate
    requested hashes on the fly.
3.  if unsupported and the size is big enough, build object fingerprint
    (including size, modtime if supported, first-found other hash if
    any).
4.  if the strict match is found in cache for the requested remote,
    return the stored hash.
5.  if remote found but fingerprint mismatched, then purge the entry and
    proceed to step 6.
6.  if remote not found or had no requested hash type or after step 5:
    download object, calculate all supported hashes on the fly and store
    in cache; return requested hash.

Other operations

-   whenever a file is uploaded or downloaded in full, capture the
    stream to calculate all supported hashes on the fly and update
    database
-   server-side move will update keys of existing cache entries
-   deletefile will remove a single cache entry
-   purge will remove all cache entries under the purged path

Note that setting max_age = 0 will disable checksum caching completely.

If you set max_age = off, checksums in cache will never age, unless you
fully rewrite or delete the file.

Cache storage

Cached checksums are stored as bolt database files under rclone cache
directory, usually ~/.cache/rclone/kv/. Databases are maintained one per
base backend, named like BaseRemote~hasher.bolt. Checksums for multiple
alias-es into a single base backend will be stored in the single
database. All local paths are treated as aliases into the local backend
(unless crypted or chunked) and stored in
~/.cache/rclone/kv/local~hasher.bolt. Databases can be shared between
multiple rclone processes.

HDFS

HDFS is a distributed file-system, part of the Apache Hadoop framework.

Paths are specified as remote: or remote:path/to/dir.

Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.

    Remote config
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = hdfs
    namenode = namenode.hadoop:8020
    username = root
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK (default)
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y
    Current remotes:

    Name                 Type

    hadoop               hdfs

    e) Edit existing remote
    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q

This remote is called remote and can now be used like this

See all the top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync the remote directory to /home/local/directory, deleting any excess
files.

    rclone sync -i remote:directory /home/local/directory

Setting up your own HDFS instance for testing

You may start with a manual setup or use the docker image from the
tests:

If you want to build the docker image

    git clone https://github.com/rclone/rclone.git
    cd rclone/fstest/testserver/images/test-hdfs
    docker build --rm -t rclone/test-hdfs .

Or you can just use the latest one pushed

    docker run --rm --name "rclone-hdfs" -p 127.0.0.1:9866:9866 -p 127.0.0.1:8020:8020 --hostname "rclone-hdfs" rclone/test-hdfs

NB it need few seconds to startup.

For this docker image the remote needs to be configured like this:

    [remote]
    type = hdfs
    namenode = 127.0.0.1:8020
    username = root

You can stop this image with docker kill rclone-hdfs (NB it does not use
volumes, so all data uploaded will be lost.)

Modified time

Time accurate to 1 second is stored.

Checksum

No checksums are implemented.

Usage information

You can use the rclone about remote: command which will display
filesystem size and current usage.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  :            0x3A        ：

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced.

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to hdfs (Hadoop distributed file
system).

--hdfs-namenode

E.g. "namenode:8020" to connect to host namenode at port 8020.

Properties:

-   Config: namenode
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HDFS_NAMENODE
-   Type: string
-   Required: true

--hdfs-username

Hadoop user name.

Properties:

-   Config: username
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HDFS_USERNAME

        -   Connect to hdfs as root.

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to hdfs (Hadoop distributed file
system).

--hdfs-service-principal-name

Kerberos service principal name for the namenode.

Enables KERBEROS authentication. Specifies the Service Principal Name
(SERVICE/FQDN) for the namenode. E.g. "hdfs/namenode.hadoop.docker" for
namenode running as service 'hdfs' with FQDN 'namenode.hadoop.docker'.

Properties:

-   Config: service_principal_name
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HDFS_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--hdfs-data-transfer-protection

Kerberos data transfer protection: authentication|integrity|privacy.

Specifies whether or not authentication, data signature integrity
checks, and wire encryption is required when communicating the the
datanodes. Possible values are 'authentication', 'integrity' and
'privacy'. Used only with KERBEROS enabled.

Properties:

-   Config: data_transfer_protection
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HDFS_DATA_TRANSFER_PROTECTION
-   Type: string
-   Required: false
-   Examples:
    -   "privacy"
        -   Ensure authentication, integrity and encryption enabled.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HDFS_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: Slash,Colon,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot

Limitations

-   No server-side Move or DirMove.
-   Checksums not implemented.

HTTP

The HTTP remote is a read only remote for reading files of a webserver.
The webserver should provide file listings which rclone will read and
turn into a remote. This has been tested with common webservers such as
Apache/Nginx/Caddy and will likely work with file listings from most web
servers. (If it doesn't then please file an issue, or send a pull
request!)

Paths are specified as remote: or remote:path.

The remote: represents the configured url, and any path following it
will be resolved relative to this url, according to the URL standard.
This means with remote url https://beta.rclone.org/branch and path fix,
the resolved URL will be https://beta.rclone.org/branch/fix, while with
path /fix the resolved URL will be https://beta.rclone.org/fix as the
absolute path is resolved from the root of the domain.

If the path following the remote: ends with / it will be assumed to
point to a directory. If the path does not end with /, then a HEAD
request is sent and the response used to decide if it it is treated as a
file or a directory (run with -vv to see details). When --http-no-head
is specified, a path without ending / is always assumed to be a file. If
rclone incorrectly assumes the path is a file, the solution is to
specify the path with ending /. When you know the path is a directory,
ending it with / is always better as it avoids the initial HEAD request.

To just download a single file it is easier to use copyurl.

Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / http Connection
       \ "http"
    [snip]
    Storage> http
    URL of http host to connect to
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
     1 / Connect to example.com
       \ "https://example.com"
    url> https://beta.rclone.org
    Remote config
    --------------------
    [remote]
    url = https://beta.rclone.org
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y
    Current remotes:

    Name                 Type
    ====                 ====
    remote               http

    e) Edit existing remote
    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q

This remote is called remote and can now be used like this

See all the top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync the remote directory to /home/local/directory, deleting any excess
files.

    rclone sync -i remote:directory /home/local/directory

Read only

This remote is read only - you can't upload files to an HTTP server.

Modified time

Most HTTP servers store time accurate to 1 second.

Checksum

No checksums are stored.

Usage without a config file

Since the http remote only has one config parameter it is easy to use
without a config file:

    rclone lsd --http-url https://beta.rclone.org :http:

or:

    rclone lsd :http,url='https://beta.rclone.org':

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to http (http Connection).

--http-url

URL of http host to connect to.

E.g. "https://example.com", or "https://user:pass@example.com" to use a
username and password.

Properties:

-   Config: url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HTTP_URL
-   Type: string
-   Required: true

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to http (http Connection).

--http-headers

Set HTTP headers for all transactions.

Use this to set additional HTTP headers for all transactions.

The input format is comma separated list of key,value pairs. Standard
CSV encoding may be used.

For example, to set a Cookie use 'Cookie,name=value', or
'"Cookie","name=value"'.

You can set multiple headers, e.g.
'"Cookie","name=value","Authorization","xxx"'.

Properties:

-   Config: headers
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HTTP_HEADERS
-   Type: CommaSepList
-   Default:

--http-no-slash

Set this if the site doesn't end directories with /.

Use this if your target website does not use / on the end of
directories.

A / on the end of a path is how rclone normally tells the difference
between files and directories. If this flag is set, then rclone will
treat all files with Content-Type: text/html as directories and read
URLs from them rather than downloading them.

Note that this may cause rclone to confuse genuine HTML files with
directories.

Properties:

-   Config: no_slash
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HTTP_NO_SLASH
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--http-no-head

Don't use HEAD requests.

HEAD requests are mainly used to find file sizes in dir listing. If your
site is being very slow to load then you can try this option. Normally
rclone does a HEAD request for each potential file in a directory
listing to:

-   find its size
-   check it really exists
-   check to see if it is a directory

If you set this option, rclone will not do the HEAD request. This will
mean that directory listings are much quicker, but rclone won't have the
times or sizes of any files, and some files that don't exist may be in
the listing.

Properties:

-   Config: no_head
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HTTP_NO_HEAD
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

Limitations

rclone about is not supported by the HTTP backend. Backends without this
capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or use policy
mfs (most free space) as a member of an rclone union remote.

See List of backends that do not support rclone about See rclone about

command.) You may put subdirectories in too, e.g.
remote:container/path/to/dir.

Configuration

The initial setup for Hubic involves getting a token from Hubic which
you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    n/s> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Hubic
       \ "hubic"
    [snip]
    Storage> hubic
    Hubic Client Id - leave blank normally.
    client_id>
    Hubic Client Secret - leave blank normally.
    client_secret>
    Remote config
    Use auto config?
     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [remote]
    client_id =
    client_secret =
    token = {"access_token":"XXXXXX"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Hubic. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is
on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to unblock it
temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List containers in the top level of your Hubic

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Hubic

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Hubic directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

If you want the directory to be visible in the official Hubic browser,
you need to copy your files to the default directory

    rclone copy /home/source remote:default/backup

--fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

Modified time

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
X-Object-Meta-Mtime as floating point since the epoch accurate to 1 ns.

This is a de facto standard (used in the official python-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.

Note that Hubic wraps the Swift backend, so most of the properties of
are the same.

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to hubic (Hubic).

--hubic-client-id

OAuth Client Id.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

-   Config: client_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HUBIC_CLIENT_ID
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--hubic-client-secret

OAuth Client Secret.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

-   Config: client_secret
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HUBIC_CLIENT_SECRET
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to hubic (Hubic).

--hubic-token

OAuth Access Token as a JSON blob.

Properties:

-   Config: token
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HUBIC_TOKEN
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--hubic-auth-url

Auth server URL.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

Properties:

-   Config: auth_url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HUBIC_AUTH_URL
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--hubic-token-url

Token server url.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

Properties:

-   Config: token_url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HUBIC_TOKEN_URL
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--hubic-chunk-size

Above this size files will be chunked into a _segments container.

Above this size files will be chunked into a _segments container. The
default for this is 5 GiB which is its maximum value.

Properties:

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HUBIC_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 5Gi

--hubic-no-chunk

Don't chunk files during streaming upload.

When doing streaming uploads (e.g. using rcat or mount) setting this
flag will cause the swift backend to not upload chunked files.

This will limit the maximum upload size to 5 GiB. However non chunked
files are easier to deal with and have an MD5SUM.

Rclone will still chunk files bigger than chunk_size when doing normal
copy operations.

Properties:

-   Config: no_chunk
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HUBIC_NO_CHUNK
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--hubic-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HUBIC_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: Slash,InvalidUtf8

Limitations

This uses the normal OpenStack Swift mechanism to refresh the Swift API
credentials and ignores the expires field returned by the Hubic API.

The Swift API doesn't return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won't check or use the
MD5SUM for these.

Jottacloud

Jottacloud is a cloud storage service provider from a Norwegian company,
using its own datacenters in Norway. In addition to the official service
at jottacloud.com, it also provides white-label solutions to different
companies, such as: * Telia * Telia Cloud (cloud.telia.se) * Telia Sky
(sky.telia.no) * Tele2 * Tele2 Cloud (mittcloud.tele2.se) * Elkjøp (with
subsidiaries): * Elkjøp Cloud (cloud.elkjop.no) * Elgiganten Sweden
(cloud.elgiganten.se) * Elgiganten Denmark (cloud.elgiganten.dk) *
Giganti Cloud (cloud.gigantti.fi) * ELKO Clouud (cloud.elko.is)

Most of the white-label versions are supported by this backend, although
may require different authentication setup - described below.

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. remote:directory/subdirectory.

Authentication types

Some of the whitelabel versions uses a different authentication method
than the official service, and you have to choose the correct one when
setting up the remote.

Standard authentication

To configure Jottacloud you will need to generate a personal security
token in the Jottacloud web interface. You will the option to do in your
account security settings (for whitelabel version you need to find this
page in its web interface). Note that the web interface may refer to
this token as a JottaCli token.

Legacy authentication

If you are using one of the whitelabel versions (e.g. from Elkjøp) you
may not have the option to generate a CLI token. In this case you'll
have to use the legacy authentication. To do this select yes when the
setup asks for legacy authentication and enter your username and
password. The rest of the setup is identical to the default setup.

Telia Cloud authentication

Similar to other whitelabel versions Telia Cloud doesn't offer the
option of creating a CLI token, and additionally uses a separate
authentication flow where the username is generated internally. To setup
rclone to use Telia Cloud, choose Telia Cloud authentication in the
setup. The rest of the setup is identical to the default setup.

Tele2 Cloud authentication

As Tele2-Com Hem merger was completed this authentication can be used
for former Com Hem Cloud and Tele2 Cloud customers as no support for
creating a CLI token exists, and additionally uses a separate
authentication flow where the username is generated internally. To setup
rclone to use Tele2 Cloud, choose Tele2 Cloud authentication in the
setup. The rest of the setup is identical to the default setup.

Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote with the
default setup. First run:

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Jottacloud
       \ "jottacloud"
    [snip]
    Storage> jottacloud
    ** See help for jottacloud backend at: https://rclone.org/jottacloud/ **

    Edit advanced config? (y/n)
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> n
    Remote config
    Use legacy authentication?.
    This is only required for certain whitelabel versions of Jottacloud and not recommended for normal users.
    y) Yes
    n) No (default)
    y/n> n

    Generate a personal login token here: https://www.jottacloud.com/web/secure
    Login Token> <your token here>

    Do you want to use a non standard device/mountpoint e.g. for accessing files uploaded using the official Jottacloud client?

    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    Please select the device to use. Normally this will be Jotta
    Choose a number from below, or type in an existing value
     1 > DESKTOP-3H31129
     2 > Jotta
    Devices> 2
    Please select the mountpoint to user. Normally this will be Archive
    Choose a number from below, or type in an existing value
     1 > Archive
     2 > Links
     3 > Sync

    Mountpoints> 1
    --------------------
    [jotta]
    type = jottacloud
    token = {........}
    device = Jotta
    mountpoint = Archive
    configVersion = 1
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your Jottacloud

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Jottacloud

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Jottacloud directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Devices and Mountpoints

The official Jottacloud client registers a device for each computer you
install it on, and then creates a mountpoint for each folder you select
for Backup. The web interface uses a special device called Jotta for the
Archive and Sync mountpoints.

With rclone you'll want to use the Jotta/Archive device/mountpoint in
most cases, however if you want to access files uploaded by any of the
official clients rclone provides the option to select other devices and
mountpoints during config. Note that uploading files is currently not
supported to other devices than Jotta.

The built-in Jotta device may also contain several other mountpoints,
such as: Latest, Links, Shared and Trash. These are special mountpoints
with a different internal representation than the "regular" mountpoints.
Rclone will only to a very limited degree support them. Generally you
should avoid these, unless you know what you are doing.

--fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

Note that the implementation in Jottacloud always uses only a single API
request to get the entire list, so for large folders this could lead to
long wait time before the first results are shown.

Note also that with rclone version 1.58 and newer information about MIME
types are not available when using --fast-list.

Modified time and hashes

Jottacloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

Jottacloud supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the --checksum flag.

Note that Jottacloud requires the MD5 hash before upload so if the
source does not have an MD5 checksum then the file will be cached
temporarily on disk (in location given by --temp-dir) before it is
uploaded. Small files will be cached in memory - see the
--jottacloud-md5-memory-limit flag. When uploading from local disk the
source checksum is always available, so this does not apply. Starting
with rclone version 1.52 the same is true for crypted remotes (in older
versions the crypt backend would not calculate hashes for uploads from
local disk, so the Jottacloud backend had to do it as described above).

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  "            0x22        ＂
  *            0x2A        ＊
  :            0x3A        ：
  <            0x3C        ＜
  >            0x3E        ＞
  ?            0x3F        ？
  |            0x7C        ｜

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in XML
strings.

Deleting files

By default, rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files.
They will be permanently deleted automatically after 30 days. You may
bypass the trash and permanently delete files immediately by using the
--jottacloud-hard-delete flag, or set the equivalent environment
variable. Emptying the trash is supported by the cleanup command.

Versions

Jottacloud supports file versioning. When rclone uploads a new version
of a file it creates a new version of it. Currently rclone only supports
retrieving the current version but older versions can be accessed via
the Jottacloud Website.

Versioning can be disabled by --jottacloud-no-versions option. This is
achieved by deleting the remote file prior to uploading a new version.
If the upload the fails no version of the file will be available in the
remote.

Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the rclone about remote: command
which will display your usage limit (unless it is unlimited) and the
current usage.

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to jottacloud (Jottacloud).

--jottacloud-md5-memory-limit

Files bigger than this will be cached on disk to calculate the MD5 if
required.

Properties:

-   Config: md5_memory_limit
-   Env Var: RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_MD5_MEMORY_LIMIT
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 10Mi

--jottacloud-trashed-only

Only show files that are in the trash.

This will show trashed files in their original directory structure.

Properties:

-   Config: trashed_only
-   Env Var: RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_TRASHED_ONLY
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--jottacloud-hard-delete

Delete files permanently rather than putting them into the trash.

Properties:

-   Config: hard_delete
-   Env Var: RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_HARD_DELETE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--jottacloud-upload-resume-limit

Files bigger than this can be resumed if the upload fail's.

Properties:

-   Config: upload_resume_limit
-   Env Var: RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_UPLOAD_RESUME_LIMIT
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 10Mi

--jottacloud-no-versions

Avoid server side versioning by deleting files and recreating files
instead of overwriting them.

Properties:

-   Config: no_versions
-   Env Var: RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_NO_VERSIONS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--jottacloud-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default:
    Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot

Limitations

Note that Jottacloud is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are quite a few characters that can't be in Jottacloud file names.
Rclone will map these names to and from an identical looking unicode
equivalent. For example if a file has a ? in it will be mapped to ？
instead.

Jottacloud only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.

Troubleshooting

Jottacloud exhibits some inconsistent behaviours regarding deleted files
and folders which may cause Copy, Move and DirMove operations to
previously deleted paths to fail. Emptying the trash should help in such
cases.

Koofr

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. remote:directory/subdirectory.

Configuration

The initial setup for Koofr involves creating an application password
for rclone. You can do that by opening the Koofr web application, giving
the password a nice name like rclone and clicking on generate.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called koofr. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n

    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK (default)
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

You can choose to edit advanced config in order to enter your own
service URL if you use an on-premise or white label Koofr instance, or
choose an alternative mount instead of your primary storage.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your Koofr

    rclone lsd koofr:

List all the files in your Koofr

    rclone ls koofr:

To copy a local directory to an Koofr directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source koofr:backup

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  \            0x5C        ＼

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in XML
strings.

Mail.ru Cloud

Mail.ru Cloud is a cloud storage provided by a Russian internet company
Mail.Ru Group. The official desktop client is Disk-O:, available on
Windows and Mac OS.

Currently it is recommended to disable 2FA on Mail.ru accounts intended
for rclone until it gets eventually implemented.

Features highlights

-   Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. remote:directory/subdirectory
-   Files have a last modified time property, directories don't
-   Deleted files are by default moved to the trash
-   Files and directories can be shared via public links
-   Partial uploads or streaming are not supported, file size must be
    known before upload
-   Maximum file size is limited to 2G for a free account, unlimited for
    paid accounts
-   Storage keeps hash for all files and performs transparent
    deduplication, the hash algorithm is a modified SHA1
-   If a particular file is already present in storage, one can quickly
    submit file hash instead of long file upload (this optimization is
    supported by rclone)

Configuration

Here is an example of making a mailru configuration. First create a
Mail.ru Cloud account and choose a tariff, then run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote

       \ "true"
     2 / Disable
       \ "false"
    speedup_enable> 1

    Remote config
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = mailru
    user = username@mail.ru
    pass = *** ENCRYPTED ***
    speedup_enable = true
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Configuration of this backend does not require a local web browser. You
can use the configured backend as shown below:

See top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote path, deleting any excess files
in the path.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:directory

Modified time

Files support a modification time attribute with up to 1 second
precision. Directories do not have a modification time, which is shown
as "Jan 1 1970".

Hash checksums

Hash sums use a custom Mail.ru algorithm based on SHA1. If file size is
less than or equal to the SHA1 block size (20 bytes), its hash is simply
its data right-padded with zero bytes. Hash sum of a larger file is
computed as a SHA1 sum of the file data bytes concatenated with a
decimal representation of the data length.

Emptying Trash

Removing a file or directory actually moves it to the trash, which is
not visible to rclone but can be seen in a web browser. The trashed file
still occupies part of total quota. If you wish to empty your trash and
free some quota, you can use the rclone cleanup remote: command, which
will permanently delete all your trashed files. This command does not
take any path arguments.

Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the rclone about remote: command
which will display your usage limit (quota) and the current usage.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  "            0x22        ＂
  *            0x2A        ＊
  :            0x3A        ：
  <            0x3C        ＜
  >            0x3E        ＞
  ?            0x3F        ？
  \            0x5C        ＼
  |            0x7C        ｜

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to mailru (Mail.ru Cloud).

--mailru-user

User name (usually email).

Properties:

-   Config: user
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_USER
-   Type: string
-   Required: true

--mailru-pass

Password.

NB Input to this must be obscured - see rclone obscure.

Properties:

-   Config: pass
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_PASS
-   Type: string
-   Required: true

--mailru-speedup-enable

Skip full upload if there is another file with same data hash.

This feature is called "speedup" or "put by hash". It is especially
efficient in case of generally available files like popular books, video
or audio clips, because files are searched by hash in all accounts of
all mailru users. It is meaningless and ineffective if source file is
unique or encrypted. Please note that rclone may need local memory and
disk space to calculate content hash in advance and decide whether full
upload is required. Also, if rclone does not know file size in advance
(e.g. in case of streaming or partial uploads), it will not even try
this optimization.

Properties:

-   Config: speedup_enable
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_SPEEDUP_ENABLE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: true
-   Examples:
    -   "true"
        -   Enable
    -   "false"
        -   Disable

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to mailru (Mail.ru Cloud).

--mailru-speedup-file-patterns

Comma separated list of file name patterns eligible for speedup (put by
hash).

Patterns are case insensitive and can contain '*' or '?' meta
characters.

Properties:

-   Config: speedup_file_patterns
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_SPEEDUP_FILE_PATTERNS
-   Type: string
-   Default: ".mkv,.avi,.mp4,.mp3,.zip,.gz,.rar,.pdf"
-   Examples:
    -   ""
        -   Empty list completely disables speedup (put by hash).
    -   "*"
        -   All files will be attempted for speedup.
    -   ".mkv,.avi,.mp4,.mp3"
        -   Only common audio/video files will be tried for put by hash.
    -   ".zip,.gz,.rar,.pdf"
        -   Only common archives or PDF books will be tried for speedup.

--mailru-speedup-max-disk

This option allows you to disable speedup (put by hash) for large files.

Reason is that preliminary hashing can exhaust your RAM or disk space.

Properties:

-   Config: speedup_max_disk
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_SPEEDUP_MAX_DISK
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 3Gi
-   Examples:
    -   "0"
        -   Completely disable speedup (put by hash).
    -   "1G"
        -   Files larger than 1Gb will be uploaded directly.
    -   "3G"
        -   Choose this option if you have less than 3Gb free on local
            disk.

--mailru-speedup-max-memory

Files larger than the size given below will always be hashed on disk.

Properties:

-   Config: speedup_max_memory
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_SPEEDUP_MAX_MEMORY
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 32Mi
-   Examples:
    -   "0"
        -   Preliminary hashing will always be done in a temporary disk
            location.
    -   "32M"
        -   Do not dedicate more than 32Mb RAM for preliminary hashing.
    -   "256M"
        -   You have at most 256Mb RAM free for hash calculations.

--mailru-check-hash

What should copy do if file checksum is mismatched or invalid.

Properties:

-   Config: check_hash
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_CHECK_HASH
-   Type: bool
-   Default: true
-   Examples:
    -   "true"
        -   Fail with error.
    -   "false"
        -   Ignore and continue.

--mailru-user-agent

HTTP user agent used internally by client.

Properties:

-   Config: user_agent
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_USER_AGENT
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--mailru-quirks

Comma separated list of internal maintenance flags.

This option must not be used by an ordinary user. It is intended only to
facilitate remote troubleshooting of backend issues. Strict meaning of
flags is not documented and not guaranteed to persist between releases.
Quirks will be removed when the backend grows stable. Supported quirks:
atomicmkdir binlist unknowndirs

Properties:

-   Config: quirks
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_QUIRKS
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--mailru-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding

-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default:
    Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot

Limitations

File size limits depend on your account. A single file size is limited
by 2G for a free account and unlimited for paid tariffs. Please refer to
the Mail.ru site for the total uploaded size limits.

Note that Mailru is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

Mega

Mega is a cloud storage and file hosting service known for its security
feature where all files are encrypted locally before they are uploaded.
This prevents anyone (including employees of Mega) from accessing the
files without knowledge of the key used for encryption.

This is an rclone backend for Mega which supports the file transfer
features of Mega using the same client side encryption.

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. remote:directory/subdirectory.

Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Mega
       \ "mega"
    [snip]
    Storage> mega
    User name
    user> you@example.com
    Password.
    y) Yes type in my own password
    g) Generate random password
    n) No leave this optional password blank
    y/g/n> y
    Enter the password:
    password:
    Confirm the password:
    password:
    Remote config
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = mega
    user = you@example.com
    pass = *** ENCRYPTED ***
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

NOTE: The encryption keys need to have been already generated after a
regular login via the browser, otherwise attempting to use the
credentials in rclone will fail.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your Mega

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Mega

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Mega directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Modified time and hashes

Mega does not support modification times or hashes yet.

Restricted filename characters

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  NUL          0x00         ␀
  /            0x2F        ／

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

Duplicated files

Mega can have two files with exactly the same name and path (unlike a
normal file system).

Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.

Use rclone dedupe to fix duplicated files.

Failure to log-in

Mega remotes seem to get blocked (reject logins) under "heavy use". We
haven't worked out the exact blocking rules but it seems to be related
to fast paced, successive rclone commands.

For example, executing this command 90 times in a row
rclone link remote:file will cause the remote to become "blocked". This
is not an abnormal situation, for example if you wish to get the public
links of a directory with hundred of files... After more or less a week,
the remote will remote accept rclone logins normally again.

You can mitigate this issue by mounting the remote it with rclone mount.
This will log-in when mounting and a log-out when unmounting only. You
can also run rclone rcd and then use rclone rc to run the commands over
the API to avoid logging in each time.

Rclone does not currently close mega sessions (you can see them in the
web interface), however closing the sessions does not solve the issue.

If you space rclone commands by 3 seconds it will avoid blocking the
remote. We haven't identified the exact blocking rules, so perhaps one
could execute the command 80 times without waiting and avoid blocking by
waiting 3 seconds, then continuing...

Note that this has been observed by trial and error and might not be set
in stone.

Other tools seem not to produce this blocking effect, as they use a
different working approach (state-based, using sessionIDs instead of
log-in) which isn't compatible with the current stateless rclone
approach.

Note that once blocked, the use of other tools (such as megacmd) is not
a sure workaround: following megacmd login times have been observed in
succession for blocked remote: 7 minutes, 20 min, 30min, 30 min, 30min.
Web access looks unaffected though.

Investigation is continuing in relation to workarounds based on
timeouts, pacers, retrials and tpslimits - if you discover something
relevant, please post on the forum.

So, if rclone was working nicely and suddenly you are unable to log-in
and you are sure the user and the password are correct, likely you have
got the remote blocked for a while.

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to mega (Mega).

--mega-user

User name.

Properties:

-   Config: user
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MEGA_USER
-   Type: string
-   Required: true

--mega-pass

Password.

NB Input to this must be obscured - see rclone obscure.

Properties:

-   Config: pass
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MEGA_PASS
-   Type: string
-   Required: true

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to mega (Mega).

--mega-debug

Output more debug from Mega.

If this flag is set (along with -vv) it will print further debugging
information from the mega backend.

Properties:

-   Config: debug
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MEGA_DEBUG
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--mega-hard-delete

Delete files permanently rather than putting them into the trash.

Normally the mega backend will put all deletions into the trash rather
than permanently deleting them. If you specify this then rclone will
permanently delete objects instead.

Properties:

-   Config: hard_delete
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MEGA_HARD_DELETE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--mega-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MEGA_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: Slash,InvalidUtf8,Dot

Limitations

This backend uses the go-mega go library which is an opensource go
library implementing the Mega API. There doesn't appear to be any
documentation for the mega protocol beyond the mega C++ SDK source code
so there are likely quite a few errors still remaining in this library.

Mega allows duplicate files which may confuse rclone.

Memory

The memory backend is an in RAM backend. It does not persist its data -
use the local backend for that.

The memory backend behaves like a bucket-based remote (e.g. like s3).
Because it has no parameters you can just use it with the :memory:
remote name.

Configuration

You can configure it as a remote like this with rclone config too if you
want to:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Memory
       \ "memory"
    [snip]
    Storage> memory
    ** See help for memory backend at: https://rclone.org/memory/ **

    Remote config

    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = memory
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK (default)
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Because the memory backend isn't persistent it is most useful for
testing or with an rclone server or rclone mount, e.g.

    rclone mount :memory: /mnt/tmp
    rclone serve webdav :memory:
    rclone serve sftp :memory:

Modified time and hashes

The memory backend supports MD5 hashes and modification times accurate
to 1 nS.

Restricted filename characters

The memory backend replaces the default restricted characters set.

Akamai NetStorage

Paths are specified as remote: You may put subdirectories in too, e.g.
remote:/path/to/dir. If you have a CP code you can use that as the
folder after the domain such as <domain>/<cpcode>/<internal directories
within cpcode>.

For example, this is commonly configured with or without a CP code: *
With a CP code.
[your-domain-prefix]-nsu.akamaihd.net/123456/subdirectory/ * Without a
CP code. [your-domain-prefix]-nsu.akamaihd.net

See all buckets rclone lsd remote: The initial setup for Netstorage
involves getting an account and secret. Use rclone config to walk you
through the setup process.

Here's an example of how to make a remote called ns1.

1.  To begin the interactive configuration process, enter this command:

    rclone config

2.  Type n to create a new remote.

    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/q> n

3.  For this example, enter ns1 when you reach the name> prompt.

    name> ns1

4.  Enter netstorage as the type of storage to configure.

    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    XX / NetStorage
       \ "netstorage"
    Storage> netstorage

5.  Select between the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. Most users should choose
    HTTPS, which is the default. HTTP is provided primarily for
    debugging purposes.

    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
     1 / HTTP protocol
       \ "http"
     2 / HTTPS protocol
       \ "https"
    protocol> 1

6.  Specify your NetStorage host, CP code, and any necessary content
    paths using this format: <domain>/<cpcode>/<content>/

    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    host> baseball-nsu.akamaihd.net/123456/content/

7.  Set the netstorage account name

    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    account> username

8.  Set the Netstorage account secret/G2O key which will be used for
    authentication purposes. Select the y option to set your own
    password then enter your secret. Note: The secret is stored in the
    rclone.conf file with hex-encoded encryption.

    y) Yes type in my own password
    g) Generate random password
    y/g> y
    Enter the password:
    password:
    Confirm the password:
    password:

9.  View the summary and confirm your remote configuration.

    [ns1]
    type = netstorage
    protocol = http
    host = baseball-nsu.akamaihd.net/123456/content/
    account = username
    secret = *** ENCRYPTED ***
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK (default)
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

This remote is called ns1 and can now be used.

Example operations

Get started with rclone and NetStorage with these examples. For
additional rclone commands, visit https://rclone.org/commands/.

See contents of a directory in your project

    rclone lsd ns1:/974012/testing/

Sync the contents local with remote

    rclone sync . ns1:/974012/testing/

Upload local content to remote

    rclone copy notes.txt ns1:/974012/testing/

Delete content on remote

    rclone delete ns1:/974012/testing/notes.txt

Move or copy content between CP codes.

Your credentials must have access to two CP codes on the same remote.
You can't perform operations between different remotes.

    rclone move ns1:/974012/testing/notes.txt ns1:/974450/testing2/

Symlink Support

The Netstorage backend changes the rclone --links, -l behavior. When
uploading, instead of creating the .rclonelink file, use the "symlink"
API in order to create the corresponding symlink on the remote. The
.rclonelink file will not be created, the upload will be intercepted and
only the symlink file that matches the source file name with no suffix
will be created on the remote.

This will effectively allow commands like copy/copyto, move/moveto and
sync to upload from local to remote and download from remote to local
directories with symlinks. Due to internal rclone limitations, it is not
possible to upload an individual symlink file to any remote backend. You
can always use the "backend symlink" command to create a symlink on the
NetStorage server, refer to "symlink" section below.

Individual symlink files on the remote can be used with the commands
like "cat" to print the destination name, or "delete" to delete symlink,
or copy, copy/to and move/moveto to download from the remote to local.
Note: individual symlink files on the remote should be specified
including the suffix .rclonelink.

Note: No file with the suffix .rclonelink should ever exist on the
server since it is not possible to actually upload/create a file with
.rclonelink suffix with rclone, it can only exist if it is manually
created through a non-rclone method on the remote.

Implicit vs. Explicit Directories

With NetStorage, directories can exist in one of two forms:

1.  Explicit Directory. This is an actual, physical directory that you
    have created in a storage group.
2.  Implicit Directory. This refers to a directory within a path that
    has not been physically created. For example, during upload of a
    file, non-existent subdirectories can be specified in the target
    path. NetStorage creates these as "implicit." While the directories
    aren't physically created, they exist implicitly and the noted path
    is connected with the uploaded file.

Rclone will intercept all file uploads and mkdir commands for the
NetStorage remote and will explicitly issue the mkdir command for each
directory in the uploading path. This will help with the
interoperability with the other Akamai services such as SFTP and the
Content Management Shell (CMShell). Rclone will not guarantee
correctness of operations with implicit directories which might have
been created as a result of using an upload API directly.

ListR Feature

NetStorage remote supports the ListR feature by using the "list"
NetStorage API action to return a lexicographical list of all objects
within the specified CP code, recursing into subdirectories as they're
encountered.

-   Rclone will use the ListR method for some commands by default.
    Commands such as lsf -R will use ListR by default. To disable this,
    include the --disable listR option to use the non-recursive method
    of listing objects.

-   Rclone will not use the ListR method for some commands. Commands
    such as sync don't use ListR by default. To force using the ListR
    method, include the --fast-list option.

There are pros and cons of using the ListR method, refer to rclone
documentation. In general, the sync command over an existing deep tree
on the remote will run faster with the "--fast-list" flag but with extra
memory usage as a side effect. It might also result in higher CPU
utilization but the whole task can be completed faster.

Note: There is a known limitation that "lsf -R" will display number of
files in the directory and directory size as -1 when ListR method is
used. The workaround is to pass "--disable listR" flag if these numbers
are important in the output.

Purge Feature

NetStorage remote supports the purge feature by using the "quick-delete"
NetStorage API action. The quick-delete action is disabled by default
for security reasons and can be enabled for the account through the
Akamai portal. Rclone will first try to use quick-delete action for the
purge command and if this functionality is disabled then will fall back
to a standard delete method.

Note: Read the NetStorage Usage API for considerations when using
"quick-delete". In general, using quick-delete method will not delete
the tree immediately and objects targeted for quick-delete may still be
accessible.

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to netstorage (Akamai
NetStorage).

--netstorage-host

Domain+path of NetStorage host to connect to.

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to netstorage (Akamai
NetStorage).

--netstorage-protocol

Select between HTTP or HTTPS protocol.

Most users should choose HTTPS, which is the default. HTTP is provided
primarily for debugging purposes.

Properties:

-   Config: protocol
-   Env Var: RCLONE_NETSTORAGE_PROTOCOL
-   Type: string
-   Default: "https"
-   Examples:
    -   "http"
        -   HTTP protocol
    -   "https"
        -   HTTPS protocol

Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the netstorage backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the "rclone backend" command for more info on how to pass options
and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
backend/command.

du

Return disk usage information for a specified directory

    rclone backend du remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

The usage information returned, includes the targeted directory as well
as all files stored in any sub-directories that may exist.

symlink

You can create a symbolic link in ObjectStore with the symlink action.

    rclone backend symlink remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

The desired path location (including applicable sub-directories) ending
in the object that will be the target of the symlink (for example,
/links/mylink). Include the file extension for the object, if
applicable. rclone backend symlink <src> <path>

Microsoft Azure Blob Storage

Paths are specified as remote:container (or remote: for the lsd
command.) You may put subdirectories in too, e.g.
remote:container/path/to/dir.

Configuration

Here is an example of making a Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
configuration. For a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
       \ "azureblob"
    [snip]
    Storage> azureblob
    Storage Account Name
    account> account_name
    Storage Account Key

    key = base64encodedkey==
    endpoint = 
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

See all containers

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new container

    rclone mkdir remote:container

List the contents of a container

    rclone ls remote:container

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote container, deleting any excess
files in the container.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:container

--fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

Modified time

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object with the mtime
key. It is stored using RFC3339 Format time with nanosecond precision.
The metadata is supplied during directory listings so there is no
overhead to using it.

Performance

When uploading large files, increasing the value of
--azureblob-upload-concurrency will increase performance at the cost of
using more memory. The default of 16 is set quite conservatively to use
less memory. It maybe be necessary raise it to 64 or higher to fully
utilize a 1 GBit/s link with a single file transfer.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  /            0x2F        ／
  \            0x5C        ＼

File names can also not end with the following characters. These only
get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  .            0x2E        ．

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

Hashes

MD5 hashes are stored with blobs. However blobs that were uploaded in
chunks only have an MD5 if the source remote was capable of MD5 hashes,
e.g. the local disk.

Authenticating with Azure Blob Storage

Rclone has 3 ways of authenticating with Azure Blob Storage:

Account and Key

This is the most straight forward and least flexible way. Just fill in
the account and key lines and leave the rest blank.

SAS URL

This can be an account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL.

To use it leave account, key blank and fill in sas_url.

An account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL can be obtained from
the Azure portal or the Azure Storage Explorer. To get a container level
SAS URL right click on a container in the Azure Blob explorer in the
Azure portal.

If you use a container level SAS URL, rclone operations are permitted
only on a particular container, e.g.

    rclone ls azureblob:container

You can also list the single container from the root. This will only
show the container specified by the SAS URL.

    $ rclone lsd azureblob:
    container/

Note that you can't see or access any other containers - this will fail

    rclone ls azureblob:othercontainer

Container level SAS URLs are useful for temporarily allowing third
parties access to a single container or putting credentials into an
untrusted environment such as a CI build server.

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to azureblob (Microsoft Azure
Blob Storage).

--azureblob-account

Storage Account Name.

Leave blank to use SAS URL or Emulator.

Properties:

-   Config: account
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ACCOUNT

-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_SAS_URL
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--azureblob-use-msi

Use a managed service identity to authenticate (only works in Azure).

When true, use a managed service identity to authenticate to Azure
Storage instead of a SAS token or account key.

If the VM(SS) on which this program is running has a system-assigned
identity, it will be used by default. If the resource has no
system-assigned but exactly one user-assigned identity, the
user-assigned identity will be used by default. If the resource has
multiple user-assigned identities, the identity to use must be
explicitly specified using exactly one of the msi_object_id,
msi_client_id, or msi_mi_res_id parameters.

Properties:

-   Config: use_msi
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_USE_MSI
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--azureblob-use-emulator

Uses local storage emulator if provided as 'true'.

Leave blank if using real azure storage endpoint.

Properties:

-   Config: use_emulator
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_USE_EMULATOR
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to azureblob (Microsoft Azure
Blob Storage).

--azureblob-msi-object-id

Object ID of the user-assigned MSI to use, if any.

Leave blank if msi_client_id or msi_mi_res_id specified.

Properties:

-   Config: msi_object_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_MSI_OBJECT_ID
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--azureblob-msi-client-id

Object ID of the user-assigned MSI to use, if any.

Leave blank if msi_object_id or msi_mi_res_id specified.

Properties:

-   Config: msi_client_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_MSI_CLIENT_ID
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--azureblob-msi-mi-res-id

Azure resource ID of the user-assigned MSI to use, if any.

Leave blank if msi_client_id or msi_object_id specified.

Properties:

-   Config: msi_mi_res_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_MSI_MI_RES_ID
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--azureblob-endpoint

Endpoint for the service.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

-   Config: endpoint
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ENDPOINT
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--azureblob-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload (<= 256 MiB) (deprecated).

Properties:

-   Config: upload_cutoff
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--azureblob-chunk-size

Upload chunk size.

Note that this is stored in memory and there may be up to "--transfers"
* "--azureblob-upload-concurrency" chunks stored at once in memory.

Properties:

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 4Mi

--azureblob-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently.

If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links
and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing
this may help to speed up the transfers.

In tests, upload speed increases almost linearly with upload
concurrency. For example to fill a gigabit pipe it may be necessary to
raise this to 64. Note that this will use more memory.

Note that chunks are stored in memory and there may be up to
"--transfers" * "--azureblob-upload-concurrency" chunks stored at once
in memory.

Properties:

-   Config: upload_concurrency
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
-   Type: int
-   Default: 16

--azureblob-list-chunk

Size of blob list.

This sets the number of blobs requested in each listing chunk. Default
is the maximum, 5000. "List blobs" requests are permitted 2 minutes per
megabyte to complete. If an operation is taking longer than 2 minutes
per megabyte on average, it will time out ( source ). This can be used
to limit the number of blobs items to return, to avoid the time out.

Properties:

-   Config: list_chunk
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_LIST_CHUNK
-   Type: int
-   Default: 5000

--azureblob-access-tier

Access tier of blob: hot, cool or archive.

Archived blobs can be restored by setting access tier to hot or cool.
Leave blank if you intend to use default access tier, which is set at
account level

If there is no "access tier" specified, rclone doesn't apply any tier.
rclone performs "Set Tier" operation on blobs while uploading, if
objects are not modified, specifying "access tier" to new one will have
no effect. If blobs are in "archive tier" at remote, trying to perform
data transfer operations from remote will not be allowed. User should
first restore by tiering blob to "Hot" or "Cool".

Properties:

-   Config: access_tier
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ACCESS_TIER
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--azureblob-archive-tier-delete

Delete archive tier blobs before overwriting.

Archive tier blobs cannot be updated. So without this flag, if you
attempt to update an archive tier blob, then rclone will produce the
error:

    can't update archive tier blob without --azureblob-archive-tier-delete

With this flag set then before rclone attempts to overwrite an archive
tier blob, it will delete the existing blob before uploading its
replacement. This has the potential for data loss if the upload fails
(unlike updating a normal blob) and also may cost more since deleting
archive tier blobs early may be chargable.

Properties:

-   Config: archive_tier_delete
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ARCHIVE_TIER_DELETE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--azureblob-disable-checksum

Don't store MD5 checksum with object metadata.

Normally rclone will calculate the MD5 checksum of the input before
uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great
for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files to
start uploading.

Properties:

-   Config: disable_checksum
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_DISABLE_CHECKSUM
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--azureblob-memory-pool-flush-time

How often internal memory buffer pools will be flushed.

Uploads which requires additional buffers (f.e multipart) will use
memory pool for allocations. This option controls how often unused
buffers will be removed from the pool.

Properties:

-   Config: memory_pool_flush_time
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_MEMORY_POOL_FLUSH_TIME
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 1m0s

--azureblob-memory-pool-use-mmap

Whether to use mmap buffers in internal memory pool.

Properties:

-   Config: memory_pool_use_mmap
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_MEMORY_POOL_USE_MMAP
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--azureblob-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: Slash,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8

--azureblob-public-access

Public access level of a container: blob or container.

Properties:

-   Config: public_access
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_PUBLIC_ACCESS
-   Type: string
-   Required: false
-   Examples:
    -   ""
        -   The container and its blobs can be accessed only with an
            authorized request.
        -   It's a default value.
    -   "blob"
        -   Blob data within this container can be read via anonymous
            request.
    -   "container"
        -   Allow full public read access for container and blob data.

--azureblob-no-head-object

If set, do not do HEAD before GET when getting objects.

Properties:

-   Config: no_head_object
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_NO_HEAD_OBJECT
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

Limitations

MD5 sums are only uploaded with chunked files if the source has an MD5
sum. This will always be the case for a local to azure copy.

rclone about is not supported by the Microsoft Azure Blob storage
backend. Backends without this capability cannot determine free space
for an rclone mount or use policy mfs (most free space) as a member of
an rclone union remote.

See List of backends that do not support rclone about See rclone about

Azure Storage Emulator Support

You can test rclone with storage emulator locally, to do this make sure
azure storage emulator installed locally and set up a new remote with
rclone config follow instructions described in introduction, set
use_emulator config as true, you do not need to provide default account
name or key if using emulator.

Microsoft OneDrive

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. remote:directory/subdirectory.

Configuration

The initial setup for OneDrive involves getting a token from Microsoft
which you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through
it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    e) Edit existing remote
    n) New remote

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Microsoft. This only runs from the moment it
opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.
This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to
unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your OneDrive

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your OneDrive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an OneDrive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Getting your own Client ID and Key

You can use your own Client ID if the default (client_id left blank) one
doesn't work for you or you see lots of throttling. The default Client
ID and Key is shared by all rclone users when performing requests.

If you are having problems with them (E.g., seeing a lot of throttling),
you can get your own Client ID and Key by following the steps below:

1.  Open
    https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade
    and then click New registration.
2.  Enter a name for your app, choose account type
    Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox),
    select Web in Redirect URI, then type (do not copy and paste)
    http://localhost:53682/ and click Register. Copy and keep the
    Application (client) ID under the app name for later use.
3.  Under manage select Certificates & secrets, click New client secret.
    Enter a description (can be anything) and set Expires to 24 months.
    Copy and keep that secret Value for later use (you won't be able to
    see this value afterwards).
4.  Under manage select API permissions, click Add a permission and
    select Microsoft Graph then select delegated permissions.
5.  Search and select the following permissions: Files.Read,
    Files.ReadWrite, Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All,
    offline_access, User.Read, and optionally Sites.Read.All (see
    below). Once selected click Add permissions at the bottom.

Now the application is complete. Run rclone config to create or edit a
OneDrive remote. Supply the app ID and password as Client ID and Secret,
respectively. rclone will walk you through the remaining steps.

The Sites.Read.All permission is required if you need to search
SharePoint sites when configuring the remote. However, if that
permission is not assigned, you need to set disable_site_permission
option to true in the advanced options.

Modification time and hashes

OneDrive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

OneDrive personal supports SHA1 type hashes. OneDrive for business and
Sharepoint Server support QuickXorHash.

For all types of OneDrive you can use the --checksum flag.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  "            0x22        ＂
  *            0x2A        ＊
  :            0x3A        ：
  <            0x3C        ＜
  >            0x3E        ＞
  ?            0x3F        ？
  \            0x5C        ＼
  |            0x7C        ｜

File names can also not end with the following characters. These only
get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠
  .            0x2E        ．

File names can also not begin with the following characters. These only
get replaced if they are the first character in the name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠
  ~            0x7E        ～

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

Deleting files

Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash. Microsoft
doesn't provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to empty the
trash, so you will have to do that with one of Microsoft's apps or via
the OneDrive website.

The ID of the drive to use.

Properties:

-   Config: drive_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_DRIVE_ID
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--onedrive-drive-type

The type of the drive (personal | business | documentLibrary).

Properties:

-   Config: drive_type
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_DRIVE_TYPE
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--onedrive-root-folder-id

ID of the root folder.

This isn't normally needed, but in special circumstances you might know
the folder ID that you wish to access but not be able to get there
through a path traversal.

Properties:

-   Config: root_folder_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--onedrive-disable-site-permission

Disable the request for Sites.Read.All permission.

If set to true, you will no longer be able to search for a SharePoint
site when configuring drive ID, because rclone will not request
Sites.Read.All permission. Set it to true if your organization didn't
assign Sites.Read.All permission to the application, and your
organization disallows users to consent app permission request on their
own.

Properties:

-   Config: disable_site_permission
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_DISABLE_SITE_PERMISSION
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--onedrive-expose-onenote-files

Set to make OneNote files show up in directory listings.

By default, rclone will hide OneNote files in directory listings because
operations like "Open" and "Update" won't work on them. But this
behaviour may also prevent you from deleting them. If you want to delete
OneNote files or otherwise want them to show up in directory listing,
set this option.

Properties:

-   Config: expose_onenote_files
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_EXPOSE_ONENOTE_FILES
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--onedrive-server-side-across-configs

Allow server-side operations (e.g. copy) to work across different
onedrive configs.

This will only work if you are copying between two OneDrive Personal
drives AND the files to copy are already shared between them. In other
cases, rclone will fall back to normal copy (which will be slightly
slower).

Properties:

-   Config: server_side_across_configs
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_SERVER_SIDE_ACROSS_CONFIGS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--onedrive-list-chunk

Size of listing chunk.

Properties:

-   Config: list_chunk
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_LIST_CHUNK
-   Type: int
-   Default: 1000

--onedrive-no-versions

Remove all versions on modifying operations.

Onedrive for business creates versions when rclone uploads new files
overwriting an existing one and when it sets the modification time.

These versions take up space out of the quota.

This flag checks for versions after file upload and setting modification
time and removes all but the last version.

NB Onedrive personal can't currently delete versions so don't use this
flag there.

Properties:

-   Config: no_versions
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_NO_VERSIONS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--onedrive-link-scope

Set the scope of the links created by the link command.

Properties:

-   Config: link_scope
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_LINK_SCOPE
-   Type: string
-   Default: "anonymous"
-   Examples:
    -   "anonymous"
        -   Anyone with the link has access, without needing to sign in.
        -   This may include people outside of your organization.
        -   Anonymous link support may be disabled by an administrator.
    -   "organization"
        -   Anyone signed into your organization (tenant) can use the
            link to get access.
        -   Only available in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint.

--onedrive-link-type

Set the type of the links created by the link command.

Properties:

-   Config: link_type
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_LINK_TYPE
-   Type: string
-   Default: "view"
-   Examples:
    -   "view"
        -   Creates a read-only link to the item.
    -   "edit"
        -   Creates a read-write link to the item.
    -   "embed"
        -   Creates an embeddable link to the item.

--onedrive-link-password

Set the password for links created by the link command.

At the time of writing this only works with OneDrive personal paid
accounts.

Properties:

-   Config: link_password
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_LINK_PASSWORD
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--onedrive-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default:
    Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,LeftSpace,LeftTilde,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot

Limitations

If you don't use rclone for 90 days the refresh token will expire. This
will result in authorization problems. This is easy to fix by running
the rclone config reconnect remote: command to get a new token and
refresh token.

Naming

Note that OneDrive is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are quite a few characters that can't be in OneDrive file names.
These can't occur on Windows platforms, but on non-Windows platforms
they are common. Rclone will map these names to and from an identical
looking unicode equivalent. For example if a file has a ? in it will be
mapped to ？ instead.

File sizes

The largest allowed file size is 250 GiB for both OneDrive Personal and
OneDrive for Business (Updated 13 Jan 2021).

Path length

The entire path, including the file name, must contain fewer than 400
characters for OneDrive, OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online. If
you are encrypting file and folder names with rclone, you may want to
pay attention to this limitation because the encrypted names are
typically longer than the original ones.

Number of files

OneDrive seems to be OK with at least 50,000 files in a folder, but at
100,000 rclone will get errors listing the directory like
couldn’t list files: UnknownError:. See #2707 for more info.

An official document about the limitations for different types of
OneDrive can be found here.

Versions

Every change in a file OneDrive causes the service to create a new
version of the the file. This counts against a users quota. For example
changing the modification time of a file creates a second version, so
the file apparently uses twice the space.

For example the copy command is affected by this as rclone copies the
file and then afterwards sets the modification time to match the source
file which uses another version.

You can use the rclone cleanup command (see below) to remove all old
versions.

Or you can set the no_versions parameter to true and rclone will remove
versions after operations which create new versions. This takes extra
transactions so only enable it if you need it.

Note At the time of writing Onedrive Personal creates versions (but not
for setting the modification time) but the API for removing them returns
"API not found" so cleanup and no_versions should not be used on
Onedrive Personal.

Disabling versioning

Starting October 2018, users will no longer be able to disable
versioning by default. This is because Microsoft has brought an update
to the mechanism. To change this new default setting, a PowerShell
command is required to be run by a SharePoint admin. If you are an
admin, you can run these commands in PowerShell to change that setting:

1.  Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell (in case
    you haven't installed this already)
2.  Import-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -DisableNameChecking
3.  Connect-SPOService -Url https://YOURSITE-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential YOU@YOURSITE.COM
    (replacing YOURSITE, YOU, YOURSITE.COM with the actual values; this
    will prompt for your credentials)
4.  Set-SPOTenant -EnableMinimumVersionRequirement $False
5.  Disconnect-SPOService (to disconnect from the server)

Below are the steps for normal users to disable versioning. If you don't
see the "No Versioning" option, make sure the above requirements are
met.

User Weropol has found a method to disable versioning on OneDrive

1.  Open the settings menu by clicking on the gear symbol at the top of
    the OneDrive Business page.
2.  Click Site settings.
3.  Once on the Site settings page, navigate to Site Administration >
    Site libraries and lists.
4.  Click Customize "Documents".
5.  Click General Settings > Versioning Settings.
6.  Under Document Version History select the option No versioning.
    Note: This will disable the creation of new file versions, but will
    not remove any previous versions. Your documents are safe.
7.  Apply the changes by clicking OK.
8.  Use rclone to upload or modify files. (I also use the
    --no-update-modtime flag)
9.  Restore the versioning settings after using rclone. (Optional)

Cleanup

OneDrive supports rclone cleanup which causes rclone to look through
every file under the path supplied and delete all version but the
current version. Because this involves traversing all the files, then
querying each file for versions it can be quite slow. Rclone does
--checkers tests in parallel. The command also supports -i which is a
great way to see what it would do.

    rclone cleanup -i remote:path/subdir # interactively remove all old version for path/subdir
    rclone cleanup remote:path/subdir    # unconditionally remove all old version for path/subdir

NB Onedrive personal can't currently delete versions

Troubleshooting

Excessive throttling or blocked on SharePoint

If you experience excessive throttling or is being blocked on SharePoint
then it may help to set the user agent explicitly with a flag like this:
--user-agent "ISV|rclone.org|rclone/v1.55.1"

The specific details can be found in the Microsoft document: Avoid
getting throttled or blocked in SharePoint Online

Unexpected file size/hash differences on Sharepoint

It is a known issue that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for
Business) silently modifies uploaded files, mainly Office files (.docx,
.xlsx, etc.), causing file size and hash checks to fail. There are also
other situations that will cause OneDrive to report inconsistent file
sizes. To use rclone with such affected files on Sharepoint, you may
disable these checks with the following command line arguments:

    --ignore-checksum --ignore-size

Alternatively, if you have write access to the OneDrive files, it may be
possible to fix this problem for certain files, by attempting the steps
below. Open the web interface for OneDrive and find the affected files
(which will be in the error messages/log for rclone). Simply click on
each of these files, causing OneDrive to open them on the web. This will
cause each file to be converted in place to a format that is
functionally equivalent but which will no longer trigger the size
discrepancy. Once all problematic files are converted you will no longer
need the ignore options above.

Replacing/deleting existing files on Sharepoint gets "item not found"

It is a known issue that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for
Business) may return "item not found" errors when users try to replace
or delete uploaded files; this seems to mainly affect Office files
(.docx, .xlsx, etc.). As a workaround, you may use the
--backup-dir <BACKUP_DIR> command line argument so rclone moves the
files to be replaced/deleted into a given backup directory (instead of
directly replacing/deleting them). For example, to instruct rclone to
move the files into the directory rclone-backup-dir on backend
mysharepoint, you may use:

    --backup-dir mysharepoint:rclone-backup-dir

access_denied (AADSTS65005)

    Error: access_denied
    Code: AADSTS65005
    Description: Using application 'rclone' is currently not supported for your organization [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] because it is in an unmanaged state. An administrator needs to claim ownership of the company by DNS validation of [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] before the application rclone can be provisioned.

This means that rclone can't use the OneDrive for Business API with your
account. You can't do much about it, maybe write an email to your
admins.

However, there are other ways to interact with your OneDrive account.
Have a look at the webdav backend: https://rclone.org/webdav/#sharepoint

invalid_grant (AADSTS50076)

    Error: invalid_grant
    Code: AADSTS50076
    Description: Due to a configuration change made by your administrator, or because you moved to a new location, you must use multi-factor authentication to access '...'.

If you see the error above after enabling multi-factor authentication
for your account, you can fix it by refreshing your OAuth refresh token.
To do that, run rclone config, and choose to edit your OneDrive backend.
Then, you don't need to actually make any changes until you reach this
question: Already have a token - refresh?. For this question, answer y
and go through the process to refresh your token, just like the first
time the backend is configured. After this, rclone should work again for
this backend.

Invalid request when making public links

On Sharepoint and OneDrive for Business, rclone link may return an
"Invalid request" error. A possible cause is that the organisation admin
didn't allow public links to be made for the organisation/sharepoint
library. To fix the permissions as an admin, take a look at the docs: 1,
2.

OpenDrive

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. remote:directory/subdirectory.

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:bucket

--fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

Multipart uploads

rclone supports multipart uploads with QingStor which means that it can
upload files bigger than 5 GiB. Note that files uploaded with multipart
upload don't have an MD5SUM.

Note that incomplete multipart uploads older than 24 hours can be
removed with rclone cleanup remote:bucket just for one bucket
rclone cleanup remote: for all buckets. QingStor does not ever remove
incomplete multipart uploads so it may be necessary to run this from
time to time.

Buckets and Zone

With QingStor you can list buckets (rclone lsd) using any zone, but you
can only access the content of a bucket from the zone it was created in.
If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong zone, you will get an
error, incorrect zone, the bucket is not in 'XXX' zone.

Authentication

There are two ways to supply rclone with a set of QingStor credentials.
In order of precedence:

-   Directly in the rclone configuration file (as configured by
    rclone config)
    -   set access_key_id and secret_access_key
-   Runtime configuration:
    -   set env_auth to true in the config file
    -   Exporting the following environment variables before running
        rclone
        -   Access Key ID: QS_ACCESS_KEY_ID or QS_ACCESS_KEY
        -   Secret Access Key: QS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY or QS_SECRET_KEY

Restricted filename characters

The control characters 0x00-0x1F and / are replaced as in the default
restricted characters set. Note that 0x7F is not replaced.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to qingstor (QingCloud Object
Storage).

--qingstor-env-auth

--qingstor-connection-retries

Number of connection retries.

Properties:

-   Config: connection_retries
-   Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_CONNECTION_RETRIES
-   Type: int
-   Default: 3

--qingstor-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload.

Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of chunk_size. The
minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.

Properties:

-   Config: upload_cutoff
-   Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 200Mi

--qingstor-chunk-size

Chunk size to use for uploading.

When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff they will be uploaded as
multipart uploads using this chunk size.

Note that "--qingstor-upload-concurrency" chunks of this size are
buffered in memory per transfer.

If you are transferring large files over high-speed links and you have
enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.

Properties:

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 4Mi

--qingstor-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently.

NB if you set this to > 1 then the checksums of multipart uploads become
corrupted (the uploads themselves are not corrupted though).

If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links
and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing
this may help to speed up the transfers.

Properties:

-   Config: upload_concurrency
-   Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
-   Type: int
-   Default: 1

--qingstor-encoding

Sia

Sia (sia.tech) is a decentralized cloud storage platform based on the
blockchain technology. With rclone you can use it like any other remote
filesystem or mount Sia folders locally. The technology behind it
involves a number of new concepts such as Siacoins and Wallet,
Blockchain and Consensus, Renting and Hosting, and so on. If you are new
to it, you'd better first familiarize yourself using their excellent
support documentation.

Introduction

Before you can use rclone with Sia, you will need to have a running copy
of Sia-UI or siad (the Sia daemon) locally on your computer or on local
network (e.g. a NAS). Please follow the Get started guide and install
one.

rclone interacts with Sia network by talking to the Sia daemon via HTTP
API which is usually available on port 9980. By default you will run the
daemon locally on the same computer so it's safe to leave the API
password blank (the API URL will be http://127.0.0.1:9980 making
external access impossible).

However, if you want to access Sia daemon running on another node, for
example due to memory constraints or because you want to share single
daemon between several rclone and Sia-UI instances, you'll need to make
a few more provisions: - Ensure you have Sia daemon installed directly
or in a docker container because Sia-UI does not support this mode
natively. - Run it on externally accessible port, for example provide
--api-addr :9980 and --disable-api-security arguments on the daemon
command line. - Enforce API password for the siad daemon via environment
variable SIA_API_PASSWORD or text file named apipassword in the daemon
directory. - Set rclone backend option api_password taking it from above
locations.

Notes: 1. If your wallet is locked, rclone cannot unlock it
automatically. You should either unlock it in advance by using Sia-UI or
via command line siac wallet unlock. Alternatively you can make siad
unlock your wallet automatically upon startup by running it with
environment variable SIA_WALLET_PASSWORD. 2. If siad cannot find the
SIA_API_PASSWORD variable or the apipassword file in the SIA_DIR
directory, it will generate a random password and store in the text file
named apipassword under YOUR_HOME/.sia/ directory on Unix or
C:\Users\YOUR_HOME\AppData\Local\Sia\apipassword on Windows. Remember
this when you configure password in rclone. 3. The only way to use siad
without API password is to run it on localhost with command line
argument --authorize-api=false, but this is insecure and strongly
discouraged.

Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a sia remote called mySia. First, run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> mySia
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    ...
    29 / Sia Decentralized Cloud
       \ "sia"
    ...
    Storage> sia
    Sia daemon API URL, like http://sia.daemon.host:9980.
    Note that siad must run with --disable-api-security to open API port for other hosts (not recommended).
    Keep default if Sia daemon runs on localhost.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("http://127.0.0.1:9980").
    api_url> http://127.0.0.1:9980
    Sia Daemon API Password.
    Can be found in the apipassword file located in HOME/.sia/ or in the daemon directory.
    y) Yes type in my own password
    g) Generate random password
    n) No leave this optional password blank (default)
    y/g/n> y
    Enter the password:
    password:
    Confirm the password:
    password:
    Edit advanced config?
    y) Yes
    n) No (default)
    y/n> n
    --------------------
    [mySia]
    type = sia
    api_url = http://127.0.0.1:9980
    api_password = *** ENCRYPTED ***
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK (default)
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Once configured, you can then use rclone like this:

-   List directories in top level of your Sia storage

    rclone lsd mySia:

-   List all the files in your Sia storage

    rclone ls mySia:

-   Upload a local directory to the Sia directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source mySia:backup

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to sia (Sia Decentralized Cloud).

--sia-api-url

Sia daemon API URL, like http://sia.daemon.host:9980.

Note that siad must run with --disable-api-security to open API port for
other hosts (not recommended). Keep default if Sia daemon runs on
localhost.

Properties:

-   Config: api_url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SIA_API_URL
-   Type: string
-   Default: "http://127.0.0.1:9980"

--sia-api-password

Sia Daemon API Password.

Can be found in the apipassword file located in HOME/.sia/ or in the
daemon directory.

NB Input to this must be obscured - see rclone obscure.

Properties:

-   Config: api_password
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SIA_API_PASSWORD
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to sia (Sia Decentralized Cloud).

--sia-user-agent

Siad User Agent

Sia daemon requires the 'Sia-Agent' user agent by default for security

Properties:

-   Config: user_agent
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SIA_USER_AGENT
-   Type: string
-   Default: "Sia-Agent"

--sia-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SIA_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: Slash,Question,Hash,Percent,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot

Limitations

-   Modification times not supported
-   Checksums not supported
-   rclone about not supported
-   rclone can work only with Siad or Sia-UI at the moment, the SkyNet
    daemon is not supported yet.
-   Sia does not allow control characters or symbols like question and
    pound signs in file names. rclone will transparently encode them for
    you, but you'd better be aware

Swift

Swift refers to OpenStack Object Storage. Commercial implementations of
that being:

-   Rackspace Cloud Files
-   Memset Memstore
-   OVH Object Storage
-   Oracle Cloud Storage
-   IBM Bluemix Cloud ObjectStorage Swift

Paths are specified as remote:container (or remote: for the lsd
command.) You may put subdirectories in too, e.g.
remote:container/path/to/dir.

    y/e/d> y

This remote is called remote and can now be used like this

See all containers

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new container

    rclone mkdir remote:container

List the contents of a container

    rclone ls remote:container

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote container, deleting any excess
files in the container.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:container

Configuration from an OpenStack credentials file

An OpenStack credentials file typically looks something something like
this (without the comments)

    export OS_AUTH_URL=https://a.provider.net/v2.0
    export OS_TENANT_ID=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
    export OS_TENANT_NAME="1234567890123456"
    export OS_USERNAME="123abc567xy"
    echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password: "
    read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    export OS_REGION_NAME="SBG1"
    if [ -z "$OS_REGION_NAME" ]; then unset OS_REGION_NAME; fi

The config file needs to look something like this where $OS_USERNAME
represents the value of the OS_USERNAME variable - 123abc567xy in the
example above.

    [remote]
    type = swift
    user = $OS_USERNAME
    key = $OS_PASSWORD
    auth = $OS_AUTH_URL
    tenant = $OS_TENANT_NAME

Note that you may (or may not) need to set region too - try without
first.

Configuration from the environment

If you prefer you can configure rclone to use swift using a standard set
of OpenStack environment variables.

When you run through the config, make sure you choose true for env_auth
and leave everything else blank.

rclone will then set any empty config parameters from the environment
using standard OpenStack environment variables. There is a list of the
variables in the docs for the swift library.

Using an alternate authentication method

If your OpenStack installation uses a non-standard authentication method
that might not be yet supported by rclone or the underlying swift
library, you can authenticate externally (e.g. calling manually the
openstack commands to get a token). Then, you just need to pass the two
configuration variables auth_token and storage_url. If they are both
provided, the other variables are ignored. rclone will not try to
authenticate but instead assume it is already authenticated and use
these two variables to access the OpenStack installation.

Using rclone without a config file

You can use rclone with swift without a config file, if desired, like
this:

    source openstack-credentials-file
    export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_TYPE=swift
    export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_ENV_AUTH=true
    rclone lsd myremote:

--fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

--update and --use-server-modtime

As noted below, the modified time is stored on metadata on the object.
It is used by default for all operations that require checking the time
a file was last updated. It allows rclone to treat the remote more like
a true filesystem, but it is inefficient because it requires an extra
API call to retrieve the metadata.

For many operations, the time the object was last uploaded to the remote
is sufficient to determine if it is "dirty". By using --update along
with --use-server-modtime, you can avoid the extra API call and simply
upload files whose local modtime is newer than the time it was last
uploaded.

Modified time

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
X-Object-Meta-Mtime as floating point since the epoch accurate to 1 ns.

This is a de facto standard (used in the official python-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.

Restricted filename characters

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  NUL          0x00         ␀
  /            0x2F        ／

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

    -   "pcs"
        -   OVH Public Cloud Storage
    -   "pca"
        -   OVH Public Cloud Archive

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to swift (OpenStack Swift
(Rackspace Cloud Files, Memset Memstore, OVH)).

--swift-leave-parts-on-error

If true avoid calling abort upload on a failure.

It should be set to true for resuming uploads across different sessions.

Properties:

-   Config: leave_parts_on_error
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SWIFT_LEAVE_PARTS_ON_ERROR
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--swift-chunk-size

-   Env Var: RCLONE_SWIFT_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 5Gi

--swift-no-chunk

Don't chunk files during streaming upload.

When doing streaming uploads (e.g. using rcat or mount) setting this
flag will cause the swift backend to not upload chunked files.

This will limit the maximum upload size to 5 GiB. However non chunked
files are easier to deal with and have an MD5SUM.

Rclone will still chunk files bigger than chunk_size when doing normal
copy operations.

Properties:

-   Config: no_chunk
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SWIFT_NO_CHUNK
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--swift-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SWIFT_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: Slash,InvalidUtf8

Limitations

The Swift API doesn't return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won't check or use the
MD5SUM for these.

Troubleshooting

Rclone gives Failed to create file system for "remote:": Bad Request

Due to an oddity of the underlying swift library, it gives a "Bad
Request" error rather than a more sensible error when the authentication
fails for Swift.

So this most likely means your username / password is wrong. You can
investigate further with the --dump-bodies flag.

This may also be caused by specifying the region when you shouldn't have
(e.g. OVH).

Rclone gives Failed to create file system: Response didn't have storage url and auth token

This is most likely caused by forgetting to specify your tenant when
setting up a swift remote.

OVH Cloud Archive

To use rclone with OVH cloud archive, first use rclone config to set up
a swift backend with OVH, choosing pca as the storage_policy.

Uploading Objects

Uploading objects to OVH cloud archive is no different to object
storage, you just simply run the command you like (move, copy or sync)
to upload the objects. Once uploaded the objects will show in a "Frozen"
state within the OVH control panel.

Retrieving Objects

To retrieve objects use rclone copy as normal. If the objects are in a
frozen state then rclone will ask for them all to be unfrozen and it
will wait at the end of the output with a message like the following:

2019/03/23 13:06:33 NOTICE: Received retry after error - sleeping until 2019-03-23T13:16:33.481657164+01:00 (9m59.99985121s)

Rclone will wait for the time specified then retry the copy.

pCloud

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. remote:directory/subdirectory.

Configuration

The initial setup for pCloud involves getting a token from pCloud which
you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Pcloud
       \ "pcloud"
    [snip]
    Storage> pcloud
    Pcloud App Client Id - leave blank normally.
    client_id> 
    Pcloud App Client Secret - leave blank normally.
    client_secret> 
    Remote config
    Use auto config?
     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [remote]
    client_id = 
    client_secret = 
    token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"bearer","expiry":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from pCloud. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is
on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to unblock it
temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your pCloud

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your pCloud

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a pCloud directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Modified time and hashes

pCloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not. In order to set a Modification time pCloud requires the object be
re-uploaded.

pCloud supports MD5 and SHA1 hashes in the US region, and SHA1 and
SHA256 hashes in the EU region, so you can use the --checksum flag.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  \            0x5C        ＼

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

Deleting files

Deleted files will be moved to the trash. Your subscription level will
determine how long items stay in the trash. rclone cleanup can be used
to empty the trash.

Root folder ID

You can set the root_folder_id for rclone. This is the directory
(identified by its Folder ID) that rclone considers to be the root of
your pCloud drive.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct
root to use itself.

However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.

In order to do this you will have to find the Folder ID of the directory
you wish rclone to display. This will be the folder field of the URL
when you open the relevant folder in the pCloud web interface.

So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
https://my.pcloud.com/#page=filemanager&folder=5xxxxxxxx8&tpl=foldergrid
in the browser, then you use 5xxxxxxxx8 as the root_folder_id in the
config.

however you will need to set it by hand if you are using remote config
with rclone authorize.

Properties:

-   Config: hostname
-   Env Var: RCLONE_PCLOUD_HOSTNAME
-   Type: string
-   Default: "api.pcloud.com"
-   Examples:

        -   EU region

premiumize.me

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. remote:directory/subdirectory.

Configuration

The initial setup for premiumize.me involves getting a token from
premiumize.me which you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks
you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / premiumize.me
       \ "premiumizeme"
    [snip]
    Storage> premiumizeme
    ** See help for premiumizeme backend at: https://rclone.org/premiumizeme/ **

    Remote config
    Use auto config?
     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = premiumizeme
    token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"2029-08-07T18:44:15.548915378+01:00"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> 

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from premiumize.me. This only runs from the moment it
opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.
This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to
unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your premiumize.me

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your premiumize.me

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an premiumize.me directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Modified time and hashes

premiumize.me does not support modification times or hashes, therefore
syncing will default to --size-only checking. Note that using --update
will work.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  \            0x5C        ＼

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to premiumizeme (premiumize.me).

--premiumizeme-api-key

API Key.

This is not normally used - use oauth instead.

Properties:

-   Config: api_key
-   Env Var: RCLONE_PREMIUMIZEME_API_KEY
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to premiumizeme (premiumize.me).

--premiumizeme-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_PREMIUMIZEME_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: Slash,DoubleQuote,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot

Limitations

Note that premiumize.me is case insensitive so you can't have a file
called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

premiumize.me file names can't have the \ or " characters in. rclone
maps these to and from an identical looking unicode equivalents ＼ and
＂

premiumize.me only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.

put.io

Paths are specified as remote:path

put.io paths may be as deep as required, e.g.
remote:directory/subdirectory.

Configuration

The initial setup for put.io involves getting a token from put.io which
you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> putio
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value

    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [putio]
    type = putio

    putio                putio

    e) Edit existing remote
    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code. This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it
may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your put.io

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your put.io

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a put.io directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Seafile

This is a backend for the Seafile storage service: - It works with both
the free community edition or the professional edition. - Seafile
versions 6.x and 7.x are all supported. - Encrypted libraries are also
supported. - It supports 2FA enabled users

Configuration

There are two distinct modes you can setup your remote: - you point your
remote to the root of the server, meaning you don't specify a library
during the configuration: Paths are specified as remote:library. You may
put subdirectories in too, e.g. remote:library/path/to/dir. - you point
your remote to a specific library during the configuration: Paths are
specified as remote:path/to/dir. This is the recommended mode when using
encrypted libraries. (This mode is possibly slightly faster than the
root mode)

Configuration in root mode

Here is an example of making a seafile configuration for a user with no
two-factor authentication. First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process. To
authenticate you will need the URL of your server, your email (or
username) and your password.

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config

    2fa = false
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK (default)
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

This remote is called seafile. It's pointing to the root of your seafile
server and can now be used like this:

See all libraries

    rclone lsd seafile:

Create a new library

    rclone mkdir seafile:library

List the contents of a library

    rclone ls seafile:library

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote library, deleting any excess
files in the library.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory seafile:library

Configuration in library mode

Here's an example of a configuration in library mode with a user that
has the two-factor authentication enabled. Your 2FA code will be asked
at the end of the configuration, and will attempt to authenticate you:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote

    y) Yes this is OK (default)
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

You'll notice your password is blank in the configuration. It's because
we only need the password to authenticate you once.

You specified My Library during the configuration. The root of the
remote is pointing at the root of the library My Library:

See all files in the library:

    rclone lsd seafile:

Create a new directory inside the library

    rclone mkdir seafile:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls seafile:directory

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote library, deleting any excess
files in the library.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory seafile:

--fast-list

Seafile version 7+ supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details. Please note this is not supported on seafile server version 6.x

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  /            0x2F        ／
  "            0x22        ＂
  \            0x5C        ＼

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

Seafile and rclone link

Rclone supports generating share links for non-encrypted libraries only.
They can either be for a file or a directory:

    rclone link seafile:seafile-tutorial.doc
    http://my.seafile.server/f/fdcd8a2f93f84b8b90f4/

or if run on a directory you will get:

    rclone link seafile:dir
    http://my.seafile.server/d/9ea2455f6f55478bbb0d/

Please note a share link is unique for each file or directory. If you
run a link command on a file/dir that has already been shared, you will
get the exact same link.

Compatibility

It has been actively tested using the seafile docker image of these
versions: - 6.3.4 community edition - 7.0.5 community edition - 7.1.3
community edition

Versions below 6.0 are not supported. Versions between 6.0 and 6.3
haven't been tested and might not work properly.

SFTP

SFTP is the Secure (or SSH) File Transfer Protocol.

The SFTP backend can be used with a number of different providers:

-   C14
-   rsync.net

SFTP runs over SSH v2 and is installed as standard with most modern SSH
installations.

Paths are specified as remote:path. If the path does not begin with a /
it is relative to the home directory of the user. An empty path remote:
refers to the user's home directory. For example, rclone lsd remote:
would list the home directory of the user cofigured in the rclone remote
config (i.e /home/sftpuser). However, rclone lsd remote:/ would list the
root directory for remote machine (i.e. /)

Note that some SFTP servers will need the leading / - Synology is a good
example of this. rsync.net, on the other hand, requires users to OMIT
the leading /.

Configuration

Here is an example of making an SFTP configuration. First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config

    [remote]
    host = example.com
    user = sftpuser
    port =
    pass =
    key_file =
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

This remote is called remote and can now be used like this:

See all directories in the home directory

    rclone lsd remote:

See all directories in the root directory

    rclone lsd remote:/

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:path/to/directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:path/to/directory

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote directory, deleting any excess
files in the directory.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:directory

Mount the remote path /srv/www-data/ to the local path /mnt/www-data

    rclone mount remote:/srv/www-data/ /mnt/www-data

SSH Authentication

The SFTP remote supports three authentication methods:

-   Password
-   Key file, including certificate signed keys
-   ssh-agent

Key files should be PEM-encoded private key files. For instance
/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa. Only unencrypted OpenSSH or PEM encrypted files
are supported.

The key file can be specified in either an external file (key_file) or
contained within the rclone config file (key_pem). If using key_pem in
the config file, the entry should be on a single line with new line (''
or '') separating lines. i.e.

    key_pem = -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMaMbaIXtE\n0gAMbMbaSsd\nMbaass\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

This will generate it correctly for key_pem for use in the config:

    awk '{printf "%s\\n", $0}' < ~/.ssh/id_rsa

If you don't specify pass, key_file, or key_pem or ask_password then
rclone will attempt to contact an ssh-agent. You can also specify
key_use_agent to force the usage of an ssh-agent. In this case key_file
or key_pem can also be specified to force the usage of a specific key in
the ssh-agent.

Using an ssh-agent is the only way to load encrypted OpenSSH keys at the
moment.

If you set the ask_password option, rclone will prompt for a password
when needed and no password has been configured.

Certificate-signed keys

With traditional key-based authentication, you configure your private
key only, and the public key built into it will be used during the
authentication process.

If you have a certificate you may use it to sign your public key,
creating a separate SSH user certificate that should be used instead of
the plain public key extracted from the private key. Then you must
provide the path to the user certificate public key file in pubkey_file.

Note: This is not the traditional public key paired with your private
key, typically saved as /home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. Setting this path
in pubkey_file will not work.

Example:

    [remote]
    type = sftp
    host = example.com
    user = sftpuser
    key_file = ~/id_rsa
    pubkey_file = ~/id_rsa-cert.pub

If you concatenate a cert with a private key then you can specify the
merged file in both places.

Note: the cert must come first in the file. e.g.

    cat id_rsa-cert.pub id_rsa > merged_key

Host key validation

By default rclone will not check the server's host key for validation.
This can allow an attacker to replace a server with their own and if you
use password authentication then this can lead to that password being
exposed.

Host key matching, using standard known_hosts files can be turned on by
enabling the known_hosts_file option. This can point to the file
maintained by OpenSSH or can point to a unique file.

e.g. using the OpenSSH known_hosts file:

    [remote]
    type = sftp
    host = example.com
    user = sftpuser
    pass = 
    known_hosts_file = ~/.ssh/known_hosts

Alternatively you can create your own known hosts file like this:

    ssh-keyscan -t dsa,rsa,ecdsa,ed25519 example.com >> known_hosts

There are some limitations:

-   rclone will not manage this file for you. If the key is missing or
    wrong then the connection will be refused.
-   If the server is set up for a certificate host key then the entry in
    the known_hosts file must be the @cert-authority entry for the CA

If the host key provided by the server does not match the one in the
file (or is missing) then the connection will be aborted and an error
returned such as

    NewFs: couldn't connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: knownhosts: key mismatch

or

    NewFs: couldn't connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: knownhosts: key is unknown

If you see an error such as

    NewFs: couldn't connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: ssh: no authorities for hostname: example.com:22

then it is likely the server has presented a CA signed host certificate
and you will need to add the appropriate @cert-authority entry.

The known_hosts_file setting can be set during rclone config as an
advanced option.

ssh-agent on macOS

Note that there seem to be various problems with using an ssh-agent on
macOS due to recent changes in the OS. The most effective work-around
seems to be to start an ssh-agent in each session, e.g.

    eval `ssh-agent -s` && ssh-add -A

And then at the end of the session

    eval `ssh-agent -k`

These commands can be used in scripts of course.

Modified time

Modified times are stored on the server to 1 second precision.

Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported.

Some SFTP servers disable setting/modifying the file modification time
after upload (for example, certain configurations of ProFTPd with
mod_sftp). If you are using one of these servers, you can set the option
set_modtime = false in your RClone backend configuration to disable this
behaviour.

-   Required: false

--sftp-key-use-agent

When set forces the usage of the ssh-agent.

When key-file is also set, the ".pub" file of the specified key-file is
read and only the associated key is requested from the ssh-agent. This
allows to avoid Too many authentication failures for *username* errors
when the ssh-agent contains many keys.

Allow asking for SFTP password when needed.

If this is set and no password is supplied then rclone will: - ask for a
password - not contact the ssh agent

Properties:

-   Config: ask_password
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_ASK_PASSWORD
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--sftp-path-override

Override path used by SSH connection.

This allows checksum calculation when SFTP and SSH paths are different.
This issue affects among others Synology NAS boxes.

Shared folders can be found in directories representing volumes

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/directory --sftp-path-override /volume2/directory

Home directory can be found in a shared folder called "home"

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/home/directory --sftp-path-override /volume1/homes/USER/directory

--sftp-subsystem

Specifies the SSH2 subsystem on the remote host.

Properties:

-   Config: subsystem
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_SUBSYSTEM
-   Type: string
-   Default: "sftp"

--sftp-server-command

Specifies the path or command to run a sftp server on the remote host.

The subsystem option is ignored when server_command is defined.

Properties:

-   Config: server_command
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_SERVER_COMMAND
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

--sftp-use-fstat

If set use fstat instead of stat.

Some servers limit the amount of open files and calling Stat after
opening the file will throw an error from the server. Setting this flag
will call Fstat instead of Stat which is called on an already open file
handle.

It has been found that this helps with IBM Sterling SFTP servers which
have "extractability" level set to 1 which means only 1 file can be
opened at any given time.

Properties:

-   Config: use_fstat
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_USE_FSTAT
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--sftp-disable-concurrent-reads

If set don't use concurrent reads.

Normally concurrent reads are safe to use and not using them will
degrade performance, so this option is disabled by default.

Some servers limit the amount number of times a file can be downloaded.
Using concurrent reads can trigger this limit, so if you have a server
which returns

    Failed to copy: file does not exist

Then you may need to enable this flag.

If concurrent reads are disabled, the use_fstat option is ignored.

Properties:

-   Config: disable_concurrent_reads
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_DISABLE_CONCURRENT_READS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--sftp-disable-concurrent-writes

If set don't use concurrent writes.

Normally rclone uses concurrent writes to upload files. This improves
the performance greatly, especially for distant servers.

This option disables concurrent writes should that be necessary.

Properties:

-   Config: disable_concurrent_writes
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_DISABLE_CONCURRENT_WRITES
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--sftp-idle-timeout

Max time before closing idle connections.

If no connections have been returned to the connection pool in the time
given, rclone will empty the connection pool.

Set to 0 to keep connections indefinitely.

Properties:

-   Config: idle_timeout
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_IDLE_TIMEOUT
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 1m0s

Limitations

SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and md5sum or
sha1sum as well as echo are in the remote's PATH. This remote
checksumming (file hashing) is recommended and enabled by default.
Disabling the checksumming may be required if you are connecting to SFTP
servers which are not under your control, and to which the execution of
remote commands is prohibited. Set the configuration option
disable_hashcheck to true to disable checksumming.

SFTP also supports about if the same login has shell access and df are
in the remote's PATH. about will return the total space, free space, and
used space on the remote for the disk of the specified path on the
remote or, if not set, the disk of the root on the remote. about will
fail if it does not have shell access or if df is not in the remote's
PATH.

Note that some SFTP servers (e.g. Synology) the paths are different for
SSH and SFTP so the hashes can't be calculated properly. For them using
disable_hashcheck is a good idea.

The only ssh agent supported under Windows is Putty's pageant.

The Go SSH library disables the use of the aes128-cbc cipher by default,
due to security concerns. This can be re-enabled on a per-connection
basis by setting the use_insecure_cipher setting in the configuration
file to true. Further details on the insecurity of this cipher can be
found in this paper.

SFTP isn't supported under plan9 until this issue is fixed.

Note that since SFTP isn't HTTP based the following flags don't work
with it: --dump-headers, --dump-bodies, --dump-auth

Note that --timeout and --contimeout are both supported.

C14

C14 is supported through the SFTP backend.

See C14's documentation

rsync.net

rsync.net is supported through the SFTP backend.

See rsync.net's documentation of rclone examples.

Storj

Storj is an encrypted, secure, and cost-effective object storage service
that enables you to store, back up, and archive large amounts of data in
a decentralized manner.

Backend options

Storj can be used both with this native backend and with the s3 backend
using the Storj S3 compatible gateway (shared or private).

Use this backend to take advantage of client-side encryption as well as
to achieve the best possible download performance. Uploads will be
erasure-coded locally, thus a 1gb upload will result in 2.68gb of data
being uploaded to storage nodes across the network.

Use the s3 backend and one of the S3 compatible Hosted Gateways to
increase upload performance and reduce the load on your systems and
network. Uploads will be encrypted and erasure-coded server-side, thus a
1GB upload will result in only in 1GB of data being uploaded to storage
nodes across the network.

Side by side comparison with more details:

-   Characteristics:
    -   Storj backend: Uses native RPC protocol, connects directly to
        the storage nodes which hosts the data. Requires more CPU
        resource of encoding/decoding and has network amplification
        (especially during the upload), uses lots of TCP connections
    -   S3 backend: Uses S3 compatible HTTP Rest API via the shared
        gateways. There is no network amplification, but performance
        depends on the shared gateways and the secret encryption key is
        shared with the gateway.
-   Typical usage:
    -   Storj backend: Server environments and desktops with enough
        resources, internet speed and connectivity - and applications
        where storjs client-side encryption is required.
    -   S3 backend: Desktops and similar with limited resources,
        internet speed or connectivity.
-   Security:
    -   Storj backend: strong. Private encryption key doesn't need to
        leave the local computer.
    -   S3 backend: weaker. Private encryption key is shared with the
        authentication service of the hosted gateway, where it's stored
        encrypted. It can be stronger when combining with the rclone
        crypt backend.
-   Bandwidth usage (upload):
    -   Storj backend: higher. As data is erasure coded on the client
        side both the original data and the parities should be uploaded.
        About ~2.7 times more data is required to be uploaded. Client
        may start to upload with even higher number of nodes (~3.7 times
        more) and abandon/stop the slow uploads.
    -   S3 backend: normal. Only the raw data is uploaded, erasure
        coding happens on the gateway.
-   Bandwidth usage (download)
    -   Storj backend: almost normal. Only the minimal number of data is
        required, but to avoid very slow data providers a few more
        sources are used and the slowest are ignored (max 1.2x
        overhead).
    -   S3 backend: normal. Only the raw data is downloaded, erasure
        coding happens on the shared gateway.
-   CPU usage:
    -   Storj backend: higher, but more predictable. Erasure code and
        encryption/decryption happens locally which requires significant
        CPU usage.
    -   S3 backend: less. Erasure code and encryption/decryption happens
        on shared s3 gateways (and as is, it depends on the current load
        on the gateways)
-   TCP connection usage:
    -   Storj backend: high. A direct connection is required to each of
        the Storj nodes resulting in 110 connections on upload and 35 on
        download per 64 MB segment. Not all the connections are actively
        used (slow ones are pruned), but they are all opened. Adjusting
        the max open file limit may be required.
    -   S3 backend: normal. Only one connection per download/upload
        thread is required to the shared gateway.
-   Overall performance:
    -   Storj backend: with enough resources (CPU and bandwidth) storj
        backend can provide even 2x better performance. Data is directly
        downloaded to / uploaded from to the client instead of the
        gateway.
    -   S3 backend: Can be faster on edge devices where CPU and network
        bandwidth is limited as the shared S3 compatible gateways take
        care about the encrypting/decryption and erasure coding and no
        download/upload amplification.
-   Decentralization:
    -   Storj backend: high. Data is downloaded directly from the
        distributed cloud of storage providers.
    -   S3 backend: low. Requires a running S3 gateway (either
        self-hosted or Storj-hosted).
-   Limitations:
    -   Storj backend: rclone checksum is not possible without download,
        as checksum metadata is not calculated during upload
    -   S3 backend: secret encryption key is shared with the gateway

Usage

Paths are specified as remote:bucket (or remote: for the lsf command.)
You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. remote:bucket/path/to/dir.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this.

Create a new bucket

Use the mkdir command to create new bucket, e.g. bucket.

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List all buckets

Use the lsf command to list all buckets.

    rclone lsf remote:

Note the colon (:) character at the end of the command line.

Delete a bucket

Use the rmdir command to delete an empty bucket.

    rclone rmdir remote:bucket

Use the purge command to delete a non-empty bucket with all its content.

    rclone purge remote:bucket

Upload objects

Use the copy command to upload an object.

    rclone copy --progress /home/local/directory/file.ext remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

The --progress flag is for displaying progress information. Remove it if
you don't need this information.

Use a folder in the local path to upload all its objects.

    rclone copy --progress /home/local/directory/ remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

Only modified files will be copied.

List objects

Use the ls command to list recursively all objects in a bucket.

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Add the folder to the remote path to list recursively all objects in
this folder.

    rclone ls remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

Use the lsf command to list non-recursively all objects in a bucket or a
folder.

    rclone lsf remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

Download objects

Use the copy command to download an object.

    rclone copy --progress remote:bucket/path/to/dir/file.ext /home/local/directory/

The --progress flag is for displaying progress information. Remove it if
you don't need this information.

Use a folder in the remote path to download all its objects.

    rclone copy --progress remote:bucket/path/to/dir/ /home/local/directory/

Delete objects

Use the deletefile command to delete a single object.

    rclone deletefile remote:bucket/path/to/dir/file.ext

Use the delete command to delete all object in a folder.

    rclone delete remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

Print the total size of objects

Use the size command to print the total size of objects in a bucket or a
folder.

    rclone size remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

Sync two Locations

Use the sync command to sync the source to the destination, changing the
destination only, deleting any excess files.

    rclone sync -i --progress /home/local/directory/ remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

The --progress flag is for displaying progress information. Remove it if
you don't need this information.

Since this can cause data loss, test first with the --dry-run flag to
see exactly what would be copied and deleted.

The sync can be done also from Storj to the local file system.

    rclone sync -i --progress remote:bucket/path/to/dir/ /home/local/directory/

Or between two Storj buckets.

    rclone sync -i --progress remote-us:bucket/path/to/dir/ remote-europe:bucket/path/to/dir/

Or even between another cloud storage and Storj.

    rclone sync -i --progress s3:bucket/path/to/dir/ storj:bucket/path/to/dir/

Limitations

rclone about is not supported by the rclone Storj backend. Backends
without this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount
or use policy mfs (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See List of backends that do not support rclone about See rclone about

Known issues

If you get errors like too many open files this usually happens when the
default ulimit for system max open files is exceeded. Native Storj
protocol opens a large number of TCP connections (each of which is
counted as an open file). For a single upload stream you can expect 110
TCP connections to be opened. For a single download stream you can
expect 35. This batch of connections will be opened for every 64 MiB
segment and you should also expect TCP connections to be reused. If you
do many transfers you eventually open a connection to most storage nodes
(thousands of nodes).

To fix these, please raise your system limits. You can do this issuing a
ulimit -n 65536 just before you run rclone. To change the limits more
permanently you can add this to your shell startup script, e.g.
$HOME/.bashrc, or change the system-wide configuration, usually
/etc/sysctl.conf and/or /etc/security/limits.conf, but please refer to
your operating system manual.

SugarSync

SugarSync is a cloud service that enables active synchronization of
files across computers and other devices for file backup, access,
syncing, and sharing.

Configuration

The initial setup for SugarSync involves getting a token from SugarSync
which you can do with rclone. rclone config walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Sugarsync
       \ "sugarsync"
    [snip]
    Storage> sugarsync
    ** See help for sugarsync backend at: https://rclone.org/sugarsync/ **

    Sugarsync App ID.
    Leave blank to use rclone's.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    app_id> 
    Sugarsync Access Key ID.

    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    private_access_key> 
    Permanently delete files if true
    otherwise put them in the deleted files.
    Enter a boolean value (true or false). Press Enter for the default ("false").
    hard_delete> 
    Edit advanced config? (y/n)
    y) Yes
    n) No (default)
    y/n> n
    Remote config
    Username (email address)> nick@craig-wood.com
    Your Sugarsync password is only required during setup and will not be stored.
    password:
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = sugarsync
    refresh_token = https://api.sugarsync.com/app-authorization/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK (default)
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Note that the config asks for your email and password but doesn't store
them, it only uses them to get the initial token.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories (sync folders) in top level of your SugarSync

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your SugarSync folder "Test"

    rclone ls remote:Test

To copy a local directory to an SugarSync folder called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. remote:directory/subdirectory.

NB you can't create files in the top level folder you have to create a
folder, which rclone will create as a "Sync Folder" with SugarSync.

Modified time and hashes

SugarSync does not support modification times or hashes, therefore
syncing will default to --size-only checking. Note that using --update
will work as rclone can read the time files were uploaded.

Restricted filename characters

SugarSync replaces the default restricted characters set except for DEL.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in XML
strings.

Deleting files

Deleted files will be moved to the "Deleted items" folder by default.

However you can supply the flag --sugarsync-hard-delete or set the
config parameter hard_delete = true if you would like files to be
deleted straight away.

Tardigrade

The Tardigrade backend has been renamed to be the Storj backend. Old
configuration files will continue to work.

Uptobox

This is a Backend for Uptobox file storage service. Uptobox is closer to
a one-click hoster than a traditional cloud storage provider and
therefore not suitable for long term storage.

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. remote:directory/subdirectory.

Configuration

To configure an Uptobox backend you'll need your personal api token.
You'll find it in your account settings

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote with the
default setup. First run:

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    Current remotes:

    Name                 Type
    ====                 ====

    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK (default)
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> 

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your Uptobox

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Uptobox

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Uptobox directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Modified time and hashes

Uptobox supports neither modified times nor checksums.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  "            0x22        ＂
  `            0x41        ｀

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in XML
strings.

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to uptobox (Uptobox).

--uptobox-access-token

Your access token.

Get it from https://uptobox.com/my_account.

Properties:

-   Config: access_token
-   Env Var: RCLONE_UPTOBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN
-   Type: string
-   Required: false

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to uptobox (Uptobox).

--uptobox-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Env Var: RCLONE_UPTOBOX_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default:
    Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,BackQuote,Del,Ctl,LeftSpace,InvalidUtf8,Dot

Limitations

Uptobox will delete inactive files that have not been accessed in 60
days.

rclone about is not supported by this backend an overview of used space
can however been seen in the uptobox web interface.

Union

The union remote provides a unification similar to UnionFS using other
remotes.

Paths may be as deep as required or a local path, e.g.
remote:directory/subdirectory or /directory/subdirectory.

During the initial setup with rclone config you will specify the
upstream remotes as a space separated list. The upstream remotes can
either be a local paths or other remotes.

Attribute :ro and :nc can be attach to the end of path to tag the remote
as read only or no create, e.g. remote:directory/subdirectory:ro or
remote:directory/subdirectory:nc.

Subfolders can be used in upstream remotes. Assume a union remote named
backup with the remotes mydrive:private/backup. Invoking
rclone mkdir backup:desktop is exactly the same as invoking
rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/desktop.

There will be no special handling of paths containing .. segments.
Invoking rclone mkdir backup:../desktop is exactly the same as invoking
rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/../desktop.

Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a union called remote for local
folders. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n

    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y
    Current remotes:

    Name                 Type

    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level in remote1:dir1, remote2:dir2 and
remote3:dir3

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in remote1:dir1, remote2:dir2 and remote3:dir3

    rclone ls remote:

Copy another local directory to the union directory called source, which
will be placed into remote3:dir3

    rclone copy C:\source remote:source

Behavior / Policies

The behavior of union backend is inspired by trapexit/mergerfs. All
functions are grouped into 3 categories: action, create and search.
These functions and categories can be assigned a policy which dictates
what file or directory is chosen when performing that behavior. Any
policy can be assigned to a function or category though some may not be
very useful in practice. For instance: rand (random) may be useful for
file creation (create) but could lead to very odd behavior if used for
delete if there were more than one copy of the file.

Function / Category classifications

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Category   Description     Functions
  ---------- --------------- -------------------------------------------------
  action     Writing         move, rmdir, rmdirs, delete, purge and copy, sync
             Existing file   (as destination when file exist)

  create     Create          copy, sync (as destination when file not exist)
             non-existing    
             file            

  search     Reading and     ls, lsd, lsl, cat, md5sum, sha1sum and copy, sync
             listing file    (as source)

  N/A                        size, about
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Path Preservation

Policies, as described below, are of two basic types. path preserving
and non-path preserving.

All policies which start with ep (epff, eplfs, eplus, epmfs, eprand) are
path preserving. ep stands for existing path.

A path preserving policy will only consider upstreams where the relative
path being accessed already exists.

When using non-path preserving policies paths will be created in target
upstreams as necessary.

Quota Relevant Policies

Some policies rely on quota information. These policies should be used
only if your upstreams support the respective quota fields.

  Policy       Required Field
  ------------ ----------------
  lfs, eplfs   Free
  mfs, epmfs   Free
  lus, eplus   Used
  lno, eplno   Objects

To check if your upstream supports the field, run
rclone about remote: [flags] and see if the required field exists.

Filters

Policies basically search upstream remotes and create a list of files /
paths for functions to work on. The policy is responsible for filtering
and sorting. The policy type defines the sorting but filtering is mostly
uniform as described below.

-   No search policies filter.
-   All action policies will filter out remotes which are tagged as
    read-only.
-   All create policies will filter out remotes which are tagged
    read-only or no-create.

If all remotes are filtered an error will be returned.

Policy descriptions

The policies definition are inspired by trapexit/mergerfs but not
exactly the same. Some policy definition could be different due to the
much larger latency of remote file systems.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Policy           Description
  ---------------- ------------------------------------------------------

WebDAV

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. remote:directory/subdirectory.

Configuration

To configure the WebDAV remote you will need to have a URL for it, and a
username and password. If you know what kind of system you are
connecting to then rclone can enable extra features.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your WebDAV

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your WebDAV

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an WebDAV directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Modified time and hashes

Plain WebDAV does not support modified times. However when used with
Owncloud or Nextcloud rclone will support modified times.

Likewise plain WebDAV does not support hashes, however when used with
Owncloud or Nextcloud rclone will support SHA1 and MD5 hashes. Depending
on the exact version of Owncloud or Nextcloud hashes may appear on all
objects, or only on objects which had a hash uploaded with them.

Provider notes

See below for notes on specific providers.

Owncloud

Click on the settings cog in the bottom right of the page and this will
show the WebDAV URL that rclone needs in the config step. It will look
something like https://example.com/remote.php/webdav/.

Owncloud supports modified times using the X-OC-Mtime header.

Nextcloud

This is configured in an identical way to Owncloud. Note that Nextcloud
initially did not support streaming of files (rcat) whereas Owncloud
did, but this seems to be fixed as of 2020-11-27 (tested with rclone
v1.53.1 and Nextcloud Server v19).

Sharepoint Online

Rclone can be used with Sharepoint provided by OneDrive for Business or
Office365 Education Accounts. This feature is only needed for a few of
these Accounts, mostly Office365 Education ones. These accounts are
sometimes not verified by the domain owner github#1975

This means that these accounts can't be added using the official API
(other Accounts should work with the "onedrive" option). However, it is
possible to access them using webdav.

To use a sharepoint remote with rclone, add it like this: First, you
need to get your remote's URL:

-   Go here to open your OneDrive or to sign in
-   Now take a look at your address bar, the URL should look like this:
    https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx

You'll only need this URL up to the email address. After that, you'll
most likely want to add "/Documents". That subdirectory contains the
actual data stored on your OneDrive.

Add the remote to rclone like this: Configure the url as
https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/Documents
and use your normal account email and password for user and pass. If you
have 2FA enabled, you have to generate an app password. Set the vendor
to sharepoint.

Your config file should look like this:

    [sharepoint]
    type = webdav
    url = https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/Documents
    vendor = sharepoint
    user = YourEmailAddress
    pass = encryptedpassword

Sharepoint with NTLM Authentication

Use this option in case your (hosted) Sharepoint is not tied to OneDrive
accounts and uses NTLM authentication.

To get the url configuration, similarly to the above, first navigate to
the desired directory in your browser to get the URL, then strip
everything after the name of the opened directory.

Example: If the URL is:
https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/12345/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx

The configuration to use would be:
https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/12345/Documents

Set the vendor to sharepoint-ntlm.

NTLM uses domain and user name combination for authentication, set user
to DOMAIN\username.

Your config file should look like this:

    [sharepoint]
    type = webdav
    url = https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]/some-path-to/Documents
    vendor = sharepoint-ntlm
    user = DOMAIN\user
    pass = encryptedpassword

Required Flags for SharePoint

As SharePoint does some special things with uploaded documents, you
won't be able to use the documents size or the documents hash to compare
if a file has been changed since the upload / which file is newer.

For Rclone calls copying files (especially Office files such as .docx,
.xlsx, etc.) from/to SharePoint (like copy, sync, etc.), you should
append these flags to ensure Rclone uses the "Last Modified" datetime
property to compare your documents:

    --ignore-size --ignore-checksum --update

dCache

dCache is a storage system that supports many protocols and
authentication/authorisation schemes. For WebDAV clients, it allows
users to authenticate with username and password (BASIC), X.509,
Kerberos, and various bearer tokens, including Macaroons and
OpenID-Connect access tokens.

Configure as normal using the other type. Don't enter a username or
password, instead enter your Macaroon as the bearer_token.

The config will end up looking something like this.

    [dcache]
    type = webdav
    url = https://dcache...
    vendor = other
    user =
    pass =
    bearer_token = your-macaroon

There is a script that obtains a Macaroon from a dCache WebDAV endpoint,
and creates an rclone config file.

Macaroons may also be obtained from the dCacheView
web-browser/JavaScript client that comes with dCache.

OpenID-Connect

dCache also supports authenticating with OpenID-Connect access tokens.
OpenID-Connect is a protocol (based on OAuth 2.0) that allows services
to identify users who have authenticated with some central service.

Support for OpenID-Connect in rclone is currently achieved using another
software package called oidc-agent. This is a command-line tool that
facilitates obtaining an access token. Once installed and configured, an
access token is obtained by running the oidc-token command. The
following example shows a (shortened) access token obtained from the XDC
OIDC Provider.

    paul@celebrimbor:~$ oidc-token XDC
    eyJraWQ[...]QFXDt0
    paul@celebrimbor:~$

Note Before the oidc-token command will work, the refresh token must be
loaded into the oidc agent. This is done with the oidc-add command
(e.g., oidc-add XDC). This is typically done once per login session.
Full details on this and how to register oidc-agent with your OIDC
Provider are provided in the oidc-agent documentation.

The rclone bearer_token_command configuration option is used to fetch
the access token from oidc-agent.

Configure as a normal WebDAV endpoint, using the 'other' vendor, leaving
the username and password empty. When prompted, choose to edit the
advanced config and enter the command to get a bearer token (e.g.,
oidc-agent XDC).

The following example config shows a WebDAV endpoint that uses
oidc-agent to supply an access token from the XDC OIDC Provider.

    [dcache]
    type = webdav
    url = https://dcache.example.org/
    vendor = other
    bearer_token_command = oidc-token XDC

Yandex Disk

Yandex Disk is a cloud storage solution created by Yandex.

Configuration

Here is an example of making a yandex configuration. First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found, make a new one?
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    n/s> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Yandex Disk
       \ "yandex"
    [snip]
    Storage> yandex
    Yandex Client Id - leave blank normally.
    client_id>
    Yandex Client Secret - leave blank normally.
    client_secret>
    Remote config
    Use auto config?
     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [remote]
    client_id =
    client_secret =
    token = {"access_token":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","token_type":"OAuth","expiry":"2016-12-29T12:27:11.362788025Z"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Yandex Disk. This only runs from the moment it
opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.
This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to
unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

See top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote path, deleting any excess files
in the path.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:directory

Yandex paths may be as deep as required, e.g.
remote:directory/subdirectory.

Modified time

Modified times are supported and are stored accurate to 1 ns in custom
metadata called rclone_modified in RFC3339 with nanoseconds format.

MD5 checksums

MD5 checksums are natively supported by Yandex Disk.

Emptying Trash

If you wish to empty your trash you can use the rclone cleanup remote:
command which will permanently delete all your trashed files. This
command does not take any path arguments.

Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the rclone about remote: command
which will display your usage limit (quota) and the current usage.

Restricted filename characters

The default restricted characters set are replaced.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be used in JSON
strings.

Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to yandex (Yandex Disk).

--yandex-client-id

OAuth Client Id.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

-   Config: client_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_YANDEX_CLIENT_ID

--yandex-hard-delete

Delete files permanently rather than putting them into the trash.

Properties:

-   Config: hard_delete
-   Env Var: RCLONE_YANDEX_HARD_DELETE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--yandex-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_YANDEX_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: Slash,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot

Limitations

When uploading very large files (bigger than about 5 GiB) you will need
to increase the --timeout parameter. This is because Yandex pauses
(perhaps to calculate the MD5SUM for the entire file) before returning
confirmation that the file has been uploaded. The default handling of
timeouts in rclone is to assume a 5 minute pause is an error and close
the connection - you'll see net/http: timeout awaiting response headers
errors in the logs if this is happening. Setting the timeout to twice
the max size of file in GiB should be enough, so if you want to upload a
30 GiB file set a timeout of 2 * 30 = 60m, that is --timeout 60m.

Having a Yandex Mail account is mandatory to use the Yandex.Disk
subscription. Token generation will work without a mail account, but
Rclone won't be able to complete any actions.

    [403 - DiskUnsupportedUserAccountTypeError] User account type is not supported.

Rclone runs a webserver on your local computer to collect the
authorization token from Zoho Workdrive. This is only from the moment
your browser is opened until the token is returned. The webserver runs
on http://127.0.0.1:53682/. If local port 53682 is protected by a
firewall you may need to temporarily unblock the firewall to complete
authorization.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

See top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote path, deleting any excess files
in the path.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:directory

Zoho paths may be as deep as required, eg remote:directory/subdirectory.

Modified time

Modified times are currently not supported for Zoho Workdrive

Checksums

No checksums are supported.

Usage information

To view your current quota you can use the rclone about remote: command
which will display your current usage.

Restricted filename characters

Only control characters and invalid UTF-8 are replaced. In addition most
Unicode full-width characters are not supported at all and will be
removed from filenames during upload.

Standard options

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ZOHO_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8

Local Filesystem

Local paths are specified as normal filesystem paths, e.g.
/path/to/wherever, so

    rclone sync -i /home/source /tmp/destination

Will sync /home/source to /tmp/destination.

Configuration

For consistencies sake one can also configure a remote of type local in
the config file, and access the local filesystem using rclone remote
paths, e.g. remote:path/to/wherever, but it is probably easier not to.

Modified time

Rclone reads and writes the modified time using an accuracy determined
by the OS. Typically this is 1ns on Linux, 10 ns on Windows and 1 Second
on OS X.

Filenames

Filenames should be encoded in UTF-8 on disk. This is the normal case
for Windows and OS X.

There is a bit more uncertainty in the Linux world, but new
distributions will have UTF-8 encoded files names. If you are using an
old Linux filesystem with non UTF-8 file names (e.g. latin1) then you
can use the convmv tool to convert the filesystem to UTF-8. This tool is
available in most distributions' package managers.

If an invalid (non-UTF8) filename is read, the invalid characters will
be replaced with a quoted representation of the invalid bytes. The name
gro\xdf will be transferred as gro‛DF. rclone will emit a debug message
in this case (use -v to see), e.g.

    Local file system at .: Replacing invalid UTF-8 characters in "gro\xdf"

Restricted characters

With the local backend, restrictions on the characters that are usable
in file or directory names depend on the operating system. To check what
rclone will replace by default on your system, run
rclone help flags local-encoding.

On non Windows platforms the following characters are replaced when
handling file names.

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  NUL          0x00         ␀
  /            0x2F        ／

When running on Windows the following characters are replaced. This list
is based on the Windows file naming conventions.

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  NUL          0x00         ␀

  \            0x5C        ＼
  |            0x7C        ｜

File names on Windows can also not end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠
  .            0x2E        ．

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can't be converted to
UTF-16.

Paths on Windows

On Windows there are many ways of specifying a path to a file system
resource. Local paths can be absolute, like C:\path\to\wherever, or
relative, like ..\wherever. Network paths in UNC format, \\server\share,
are also supported. Path separator can be either \ (as in
C:\path\to\wherever) or / (as in C:/path/to/wherever). Length of these
paths are limited to 259 characters for files and 247 characters for
directories, but there is an alternative extended-length path format
increasing the limit to (approximately) 32,767 characters. This format
requires absolute paths and the use of prefix \\?\, e.g.
\\?\D:\some\very\long\path. For convenience rclone will automatically
convert regular paths into the corresponding extended-length paths, so
in most cases you do not have to worry about this (read more below).

Note that Windows supports using the same prefix \\?\ to specify path to
volumes identified by their GUID, e.g.
\\?\Volume{b75e2c83-0000-0000-0000-602f00000000}\some\path. This is not
supported in rclone, due to an issue in go.

Long paths

Rclone handles long paths automatically, by converting all paths to
extended-length path format, which allows paths up to 32,767 characters.

This conversion will ensure paths are absolute and prefix them with the
\\?\. This is why you will see that your paths, for instance .\files is
shown as path \\?\C:\files in the output, and \\server\share as
\\?\UNC\server\share.

However, in rare cases this may cause problems with buggy file system
drivers like EncFS. To disable UNC conversion globally, add this to your
.rclone.conf file:

    [local]
    nounc = true

If you want to selectively disable UNC, you can add it to a separate
entry like this:

    [nounc]
    type = local
    nounc = true

And use rclone like this:

rclone copy c:\src nounc:z:\dst

This will use UNC paths on c:\src but not on z:\dst. Of course this will
cause problems if the absolute path length of a file exceeds 259
characters on z, so only use this option if you have to.

Symlinks / Junction points

Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).

If you supply --copy-links or -L then rclone will follow the symlink and
copy the pointed to file or directory. Note that this flag is
incompatible with --links / -l.

This flag applies to all commands.

For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this

    $ tree /tmp/a
    /tmp/a
    ├── b -> ../b
    ├── expected -> ../expected
    ├── one
    └── two
        └── three

Then you can see the difference with and without the flag like this

    $ rclone ls /tmp/a
            6 one
            6 two/three

and

    $ rclone -L ls /tmp/a
         4174 expected
            6 one
            6 two/three
            6 b/two
            6 b/one

--links, -l

Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).

If you supply this flag then rclone will copy symbolic links from the
local storage, and store them as text files, with a '.rclonelink' suffix
in the remote storage.

The text file will contain the target of the symbolic link (see
example).

This flag applies to all commands.

For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this

    $ tree /tmp/a
    /tmp/a
    ├── file1 -> ./file4
    └── file2 -> /home/user/file3

Copying the entire directory with '-l'

    $ rclone copyto -l /tmp/a/file1 remote:/tmp/a/

The remote files are created with a '.rclonelink' suffix

    $ rclone ls remote:/tmp/a
           5 file1.rclonelink
          14 file2.rclonelink

The remote files will contain the target of the symbolic links

    $ rclone cat remote:/tmp/a/file1.rclonelink
    ./file4

    $ rclone cat remote:/tmp/a/file2.rclonelink
    /home/user/file3

Copying them back with '-l'

    $ rclone copyto -l remote:/tmp/a/ /tmp/b/

    $ tree /tmp/b
    /tmp/b
    ├── file1 -> ./file4
    └── file2 -> /home/user/file3

However, if copied back without '-l'

    $ rclone copyto remote:/tmp/a/ /tmp/b/

    $ tree /tmp/b
    /tmp/b
    ├── file1.rclonelink
    └── file2.rclonelink

Note that this flag is incompatible with -copy-links / -L.

Restricting filesystems with --one-file-system

Normally rclone will recurse through filesystems as mounted.

However if you set --one-file-system or -x this tells rclone to stay in
the filesystem specified by the root and not to recurse into different
file systems.

For example if you have a directory hierarchy like this

    root
    ├── disk1     - disk1 mounted on the root
    │   └── file3 - stored on disk1
    ├── disk2     - disk2 mounted on the root
    │   └── file4 - stored on disk12
    ├── file1     - stored on the root disk
    └── file2     - stored on the root disk

Using rclone --one-file-system copy root remote: will only copy file1
and file2. Eg

    $ rclone -q --one-file-system ls root
            0 file1
            0 file2

    $ rclone -q ls root
            0 disk1/file3
            0 disk2/file4
            0 file1
            0 file2

NB Rclone (like most unix tools such as du, rsync and tar) treats a bind
mount to the same device as being on the same filesystem.

NB This flag is only available on Unix based systems. On systems where
it isn't supported (e.g. Windows) it will be ignored.

Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to local (Local Disk).

--local-nounc

Disable UNC (long path names) conversion on Windows.

Properties:

-   Config: nounc
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_NOUNC
-   Type: string
-   Required: false
-   Examples:
    -   "true"
        -   Disables long file names.

--copy-links / -L

Follow symlinks and copy the pointed to item.

Properties:

-   Config: copy_links
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_COPY_LINKS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--links / -l

Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a '.rclonelink' extension.

Properties:

-   Config: links
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_LINKS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--skip-links

Don't warn about skipped symlinks.

This flag disables warning messages on skipped symlinks or junction
points, as you explicitly acknowledge that they should be skipped.

Properties:

-   Config: skip_links
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--local-zero-size-links

Assume the Stat size of links is zero (and read them instead)
(deprecated).

Rclone used to use the Stat size of links as the link size, but this
fails in quite a few places:

-   Windows
-   On some virtual filesystems (such ash LucidLink)
-   Android

So rclone now always reads the link.

Properties:

-   Config: zero_size_links
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_ZERO_SIZE_LINKS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--local-unicode-normalization

Apply unicode NFC normalization to paths and filenames.

This flag can be used to normalize file names into unicode NFC form that
are read from the local filesystem.

Rclone does not normally touch the encoding of file names it reads from
the file system.

This can be useful when using macOS as it normally provides decomposed
(NFD) unicode which in some language (eg Korean) doesn't display
properly on some OSes.

Note that rclone compares filenames with unicode normalization in the
sync routine so this flag shouldn't normally be used.

Properties:

-   Config: unicode_normalization
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_UNICODE_NORMALIZATION
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--local-no-check-updated

Don't check to see if the files change during upload.

Normally rclone checks the size and modification time of files as they
are being uploaded and aborts with a message which starts "can't copy -
source file is being updated" if the file changes during upload.

However on some file systems this modification time check may fail (e.g.
Glusterfs #2206) so this check can be disabled with this flag.

If this flag is set, rclone will use its best efforts to transfer a file
which is being updated. If the file is only having things appended to it
(e.g. a log) then rclone will transfer the log file with the size it had
the first time rclone saw it.

If the file is being modified throughout (not just appended to) then the
transfer may fail with a hash check failure.

In detail, once the file has had stat() called on it for the first time
we:

-   Only transfer the size that stat gave
-   Only checksum the size that stat gave
-   Don't update the stat info for the file

Properties:

-   Config: no_check_updated
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_CHECK_UPDATED
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--one-file-system / -x

Don't cross filesystem boundaries (unix/macOS only).

Properties:

-   Config: one_file_system
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_ONE_FILE_SYSTEM
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--local-case-sensitive

Force the filesystem to report itself as case sensitive.

Normally the local backend declares itself as case insensitive on
Windows/macOS and case sensitive for everything else. Use this flag to
override the default choice.

Properties:

-   Config: case_sensitive
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_CASE_SENSITIVE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--local-case-insensitive

Force the filesystem to report itself as case insensitive.

Normally the local backend declares itself as case insensitive on
Windows/macOS and case sensitive for everything else. Use this flag to
override the default choice.

Properties:

-   Config: case_insensitive
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_CASE_INSENSITIVE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--local-no-preallocate

Disable preallocation of disk space for transferred files.

Preallocation of disk space helps prevent filesystem fragmentation.
However, some virtual filesystem layers (such as Google Drive File
Stream) may incorrectly set the actual file size equal to the
preallocated space, causing checksum and file size checks to fail. Use
this flag to disable preallocation.

Properties:

-   Config: no_preallocate
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_PREALLOCATE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--local-no-sparse

Disable sparse files for multi-thread downloads.

On Windows platforms rclone will make sparse files when doing
multi-thread downloads. This avoids long pauses on large files where the
OS zeros the file. However sparse files may be undesirable as they cause
disk fragmentation and can be slow to work with.

Properties:

-   Config: no_sparse
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_SPARSE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--local-no-set-modtime

Disable setting modtime.

Normally rclone updates modification time of files after they are done
uploading. This can cause permissions issues on Linux platforms when the
user rclone is running as does not own the file uploaded, such as when
copying to a CIFS mount owned by another user. If this option is
enabled, rclone will no longer update the modtime after copying a file.

Properties:

-   Config: no_set_modtime
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_SET_MODTIME
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

--local-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the encoding section in the overview for more info.

Properties:

-   Config: encoding
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_ENCODING
-   Type: MultiEncoder
-   Default: Slash,Dot

Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the local backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the "rclone backend" command for more info on how to pass options
and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
backend/command.

noop

A null operation for testing backend commands

    rclone backend noop remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This is a test command which has some options you can try to change the
output.

Options:

-   "echo": echo the input arguments
-   "error": return an error based on option value

Bugs and Limitations

Limitations

Directory timestamps aren't preserved

Rclone doesn't currently preserve the timestamps of directories. This is
because rclone only really considers objects when syncing.

Rclone struggles with millions of files in a directory/bucket

Currently rclone loads each directory/bucket entirely into memory before
using it. Since each rclone object takes 0.5k-1k of memory this can take
a very long time and use a large amount of memory.

Millions of files in a directory tends to occur on bucket-based remotes
(e.g. S3 buckets) since those remotes do not segregate subdirectories
within the bucket.

Bucket-based remotes and folders

Bucket-based remotes (e.g. S3/GCS/Swift/B2) do not have a concept of
directories. Rclone therefore cannot create directories in them which
means that empty directories on a bucket-based remote will tend to
disappear.

Some software creates empty keys ending in / as directory markers.
Rclone doesn't do this as it potentially creates more objects and costs
more. This ability may be added in the future (probably via a
flag/option).

Frequently Asked Questions

Do all cloud storage systems support all rclone commands

Yes they do. All the rclone commands (e.g. sync, copy, etc.) will work
on all the remote storage systems.

Can I copy the config from one machine to another

Sure! Rclone stores all of its config in a single file. If you want to
find this file, run rclone config file which will tell you where it is.

See the remote setup docs for more info.

How do I configure rclone on a remote / headless box with no browser?

This has now been documented in its own remote setup page.

Can rclone sync directly from drive to s3

Rclone can sync between two remote cloud storage systems just fine.

Note that it effectively downloads the file and uploads it again, so the
node running rclone would need to have lots of bandwidth.

The syncs would be incremental (on a file by file basis).

Eg

    rclone sync -i drive:Folder s3:bucket

Using rclone from multiple locations at the same time

You can use rclone from multiple places at the same time if you choose
different subdirectory for the output, e.g.

    Server A> rclone sync -i /tmp/whatever remote:ServerA
    Server B> rclone sync -i /tmp/whatever remote:ServerB

If you sync to the same directory then you should use rclone copy
otherwise the two instances of rclone may delete each other's files,
e.g.

    Server A> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup
    Server B> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup

The file names you upload from Server A and Server B should be different
in this case, otherwise some file systems (e.g. Drive) may make
duplicates.

Why doesn't rclone support partial transfers / binary diffs like rsync?

Rclone stores each file you transfer as a native object on the remote
cloud storage system. This means that you can see the files you upload
as expected using alternative access methods (e.g. using the Google
Drive web interface). There is a 1:1 mapping between files on your hard
disk and objects created in the cloud storage system.

Cloud storage systems (at least none I've come across yet) don't support
partially uploading an object. You can't take an existing object, and
change some bytes in the middle of it.

It would be possible to make a sync system which stored binary diffs
instead of whole objects like rclone does, but that would break the 1:1
mapping of files on your hard disk to objects in the remote cloud
storage system.

All the cloud storage systems support partial downloads of content, so
it would be possible to make partial downloads work. However to make
this work efficiently this would require storing a significant amount of
metadata, which breaks the desired 1:1 mapping of files to objects.

Can rclone do bi-directional sync?

No, not at present. rclone only does uni-directional sync from A -> B.
It may do in the future though since it has all the primitives - it just
requires writing the algorithm to do it.

Can I use rclone with an HTTP proxy?

Yes. rclone will follow the standard environment variables for proxies,
similar to cURL and other programs.

In general the variables are called http_proxy (for services reached
over http) and https_proxy (for services reached over https). Most
public services will be using https, but you may wish to set both.

The content of the variable is protocol://server:port. The protocol
value is the one used to talk to the proxy server, itself, and is
commonly either http or socks5.

Slightly annoyingly, there is no standard for the name; some
applications may use http_proxy but another one HTTP_PROXY. The Go
libraries used by rclone will try both variations, but you may wish to
set all possibilities. So, on Linux, you may end up with code similar to

    export http_proxy=http://proxyserver:12345
    export https_proxy=$http_proxy
    export HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy
    export HTTPS_PROXY=$http_proxy

The NO_PROXY allows you to disable the proxy for specific hosts. Hosts
must be comma separated, and can contain domains or parts. For instance
"foo.com" also matches "bar.foo.com".

e.g.

    export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.0/8,my.host.name
    export NO_PROXY=$no_proxy

Note that the ftp backend does not support ftp_proxy yet.

Rclone gives x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided error

This means that rclone can't find the SSL root certificates. Likely you
are running rclone on a NAS with a cut-down Linux OS, or possibly on
Solaris.

Rclone (via the Go runtime) tries to load the root certificates from
these places on Linux.

    "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt", // Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo etc.
    "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt",   // Fedora/RHEL
    "/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem",             // OpenSUSE
    "/etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem",            // OpenELEC

So doing something like this should fix the problem. It also sets the
time which is important for SSL to work properly.

    mkdir -p /etc/ssl/certs/
    curl -o /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt
    ntpclient -s -h pool.ntp.org

The two environment variables SSL_CERT_FILE and SSL_CERT_DIR, mentioned
in the x509 package, provide an additional way to provide the SSL root
certificates.

Note that you may need to add the --insecure option to the curl command
line if it doesn't work without.

    curl --insecure -o /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt

Rclone gives Failed to load config file: function not implemented error

Likely this means that you are running rclone on Linux version not
supported by the go runtime, ie earlier than version 2.6.23.

See the system requirements section in the go install docs for full
details.

All my uploaded docx/xlsx/pptx files appear as archive/zip

This is caused by uploading these files from a Windows computer which
hasn't got the Microsoft Office suite installed. The easiest way to fix
is to install the Word viewer and the Microsoft Office Compatibility
Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 and later versions' file
formats

tcp lookup some.domain.com no such host

This happens when rclone cannot resolve a domain. Please check that your
DNS setup is generally working, e.g.

    # both should print a long list of possible IP addresses
    dig www.googleapis.com          # resolve using your default DNS
    dig www.googleapis.com @8.8.8.8 # resolve with Google's DNS server

If you are using systemd-resolved (default on Arch Linux), ensure it is
at version 233 or higher. Previous releases contain a bug which causes
not all domains to be resolved properly.

Additionally with the GODEBUG=netdns= environment variable the Go
resolver decision can be influenced. This also allows to resolve certain
issues with DNS resolution. See the name resolution section in the go
docs.

The total size reported in the stats for a sync is wrong and keeps changing

It is likely you have more than 10,000 files that need to be synced. By
default, rclone only gets 10,000 files ahead in a sync so as not to use
up too much memory. You can change this default with the --max-backlog
flag.

Rclone is using too much memory or appears to have a memory leak

Rclone is written in Go which uses a garbage collector. The default
settings for the garbage collector mean that it runs when the heap size
has doubled.

However it is possible to tune the garbage collector to use less memory
by setting GOGC to a lower value, say export GOGC=20. This will make the
garbage collector work harder, reducing memory size at the expense of
CPU usage.

The most common cause of rclone using lots of memory is a single
directory with thousands or millions of files in. Rclone has to load
this entirely into memory as rclone objects. Each rclone object takes
0.5k-1k of memory.

Rclone changes fullwidth Unicode punctuation marks in file names

For example: On a Windows system, you have a file with name Test：1.jpg,
where ： is the Unicode fullwidth colon symbol. When using rclone to
copy this to your Google Drive, you will notice that the file gets
renamed to Test:1.jpg, where : is the regular (halfwidth) colon.

The reason for such renames is the way rclone handles different
restricted filenames on different cloud storage systems. It tries to
avoid ambiguous file names as much and allow moving files between many
cloud storage systems transparently, by replacing invalid characters
with similar looking Unicode characters when transferring to one storage
system, and replacing back again when transferring to a different
storage system where the original characters are supported. When the
same Unicode characters are intentionally used in file names, this
replacement strategy leads to unwanted renames. Read more here.
