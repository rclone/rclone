## About rclone {#about}

Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. It
is a feature-rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage
interfaces. [Over 70 cloud storage products](#providers) support
rclone including S3 object stores, business & consumer file storage
services, as well as standard transfer protocols.

Rclone has powerful cloud equivalents to the unix commands rsync, cp,
mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat. Rclone's familiar syntax
includes shell pipeline support, and `--dry-run` protection. It is
used at the command line, in scripts or via its [API](/rc).

Users call rclone *"The Swiss army knife of cloud storage"*, and
*"Technology indistinguishable from magic"*.

Rclone really looks after your data. It preserves timestamps and
verifies checksums at all times. Transfers over limited bandwidth;
intermittent connections, or subject to quota can be restarted, from
the last good file transferred. You can
[check](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/) the integrity of your files. Where
possible, rclone employs server-side transfers to minimise local
bandwidth use and transfers from one provider to another without
using local disk.

Virtual backends wrap local and cloud file systems to apply
[encryption](https://rclone.org/crypt/),
[compression](https://rclone.org/compress/),
[chunking](https://rclone.org/chunker/),
[hashing](https://rclone.org/hasher/) and
[joining](https://rclone.org/union/).

Rclone [mounts](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) any local, cloud or
virtual filesystem as a disk on Windows,
macOS, linux and FreeBSD, and also serves these over
[SFTP](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_sftp/),
[HTTP](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_http/),
[WebDAV](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_webdav/),
[FTP](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_ftp/) and
[DLNA](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_dlna/).

Rclone is mature, open-source software originally inspired by rsync
and written in [Go](https://golang.org). The friendly support
community is familiar with varied use cases. Official Ubuntu, Debian,
Fedora, Brew and Chocolatey repos. include rclone. For the latest
version [downloading from rclone.org](https://rclone.org/downloads/) is recommended.

Rclone is widely used on Linux, Windows and Mac. Third-party
developers create innovative backup, restore, GUI and business
process solutions using the rclone command line or API.

Rclone does the heavy lifting of communicating with cloud storage.

## What can rclone do for you? {#what}

Rclone helps you:

- Backup (and encrypt) files to cloud storage
- Restore (and decrypt) files from cloud storage
- Mirror cloud data to other cloud services or locally
- Migrate data to the cloud, or between cloud storage vendors
- Mount multiple, encrypted, cached or diverse cloud storage as a disk
- Analyse and account for data held on cloud storage using [lsf](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsf/), [ljson](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsjson/), [size](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_size/), [ncdu](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_ncdu/)
- [Union](https://rclone.org/union/) file systems together to present multiple local and/or cloud file systems as one

# Install

Rclone is a Go program and comes as a single binary file.

## Quickstart

  * [Download](https://rclone.org/downloads/) the relevant binary.
  * Extract the `rclone` executable, `rclone.exe` on Windows, from the archive.
  * Run `rclone config` to setup. See [rclone config docs](https://rclone.org/docs/) for more details.
  * Optionally configure [automatic execution](#autostart).

See below for some expanded Linux / macOS / Windows instructions.

See the [usage](https://rclone.org/docs/) docs for how to use rclone, or
run `rclone -h`.

Already installed rclone can be easily updated to the latest version
using the [rclone selfupdate](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/) command.

See [the release signing docs](https://rclone.org/release_signing/) for how to verify
signatures on the release.

## Script installation

To install rclone on Linux/macOS/BSD systems, run:

    sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash

For beta installation, run:

    sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash -s beta

Note that this script checks the version of rclone installed first and
won't re-download if not needed.

## Linux installation {#linux}

### Precompiled binary {#linux-precompiled}

Fetch and unpack

    curl -O https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
    unzip rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
    cd rclone-*-linux-amd64

Copy binary file

    sudo cp rclone /usr/bin/
    sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/rclone
    sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/rclone

Install manpage

    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man1
    sudo cp rclone.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/
    sudo mandb

Run `rclone config` to setup. See [rclone config docs](https://rclone.org/docs/) for more details.

    rclone config

## macOS installation {#macos}

### Installation with brew {#macos-brew}

    brew install rclone

NOTE: This version of rclone will not support `mount` any more (see
[#5373](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5373)). If mounting is wanted
on macOS, either install a precompiled binary or enable the relevant option
when [installing from source](#source).

Note that this is a third party installer not controlled by the rclone
developers so it may be out of date. Its current version is as below.

[![Homebrew package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/homebrew/rclone.svg)](https://repology.org/project/rclone/versions)

### Installation with MacPorts {#macos-macports}

On macOS, rclone can also be installed via [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org):

    sudo port install rclone

Note that this is a third party installer not controlled by the rclone
developers so it may be out of date. Its current version is as below.

[![MacPorts port](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/macports/rclone.svg)](https://repology.org/project/rclone/versions)

More information [here](https://ports.macports.org/port/rclone/).

### Precompiled binary, using curl {#macos-precompiled}

To avoid problems with macOS gatekeeper enforcing the binary to be signed and
notarized it is enough to download with `curl`.

Download the latest version of rclone.

    cd && curl -O https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-osx-amd64.zip

Unzip the download and cd to the extracted folder.

    unzip -a rclone-current-osx-amd64.zip && cd rclone-*-osx-amd64

Move rclone to your $PATH. You will be prompted for your password.

    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
    sudo mv rclone /usr/local/bin/

(the `mkdir` command is safe to run, even if the directory already exists).

Remove the leftover files.

    cd .. && rm -rf rclone-*-osx-amd64 rclone-current-osx-amd64.zip

Run `rclone config` to setup. See [rclone config docs](https://rclone.org/docs/) for more details.

    rclone config

### Precompiled binary, using a web browser  {#macos-precompiled-web}

When downloading a binary with a web browser, the browser will set the macOS
gatekeeper quarantine attribute. Starting from Catalina, when attempting to run
`rclone`, a pop-up will appear saying:

    "rclone" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
    macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.

The simplest fix is to run

    xattr -d com.apple.quarantine rclone

## Windows installation {#windows}

### Precompiled binary {#windows-precompiled}

Fetch the correct binary for your processor type by clicking on these
links. If not sure, use the first link.

- [Intel/AMD - 64 Bit](https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-windows-amd64.zip)
- [Intel/AMD - 32 Bit](https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-windows-386.zip)
- [ARM - 64 Bit](https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-windows-arm64.zip)

Open this file in the Explorer and extract `rclone.exe`. Rclone is a
portable executable so you can place it wherever is convenient.

Open a CMD window (or powershell) and run the binary. Note that rclone
does not launch a GUI by default, it runs in the CMD Window.

- Run `rclone.exe config` to setup. See [rclone config docs](https://rclone.org/docs/) for more details.
- Optionally configure [automatic execution](#autostart).

If you are planning to use the [rclone mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/)
feature then you will need to install the third party utility
[WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev/) also.

### Windows package manager (Winget) {#windows-chocolatey}

[Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/) comes pre-installed with the latest versions of Windows. If not, update the [App Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/p/app-installer/9nblggh4nns1) package from the Microsoft store.

To install rclone
```
winget install Rclone.Rclone
```
To uninstall rclone
```
winget uninstall Rclone.Rclone --force
```

### Chocolatey package manager {#windows-chocolatey}

Make sure you have [Choco](https://chocolatey.org/) installed

```
choco search rclone
choco install rclone
```

This will install rclone on your Windows machine. If you are planning
to use [rclone mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) then

```
choco install winfsp
```

will install that too.

Note that this is a third party installer not controlled by the rclone
developers so it may be out of date. Its current version is as below.

[![Chocolatey package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/chocolatey/rclone.svg)](https://repology.org/project/rclone/versions)

### Scoop package manager {#windows-scoop}

Make sure you have [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) installed

```
scoop install rclone
```

Note that this is a third party installer not controlled by the rclone
developers so it may be out of date. Its current version is as below.

[![Scoop package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/scoop/rclone.svg)](https://repology.org/project/rclone/versions)

## Package manager installation {#package-manager}

Many Linux, Windows, macOS and other OS distributions package and
distribute rclone.

The distributed versions of rclone are often quite out of date and for
this reason we recommend one of the other installation methods if
possible.

You can get an idea of how up to date or not your OS distribution's
package is here.

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/rclone.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/rclone/versions)

## Docker installation {#docker}

The rclone developers maintain a [docker image for rclone](https://hub.docker.com/r/rclone/rclone).

These images are built as part of the release process based on a
minimal Alpine Linux.

The `:latest` tag will always point to the latest stable release.  You
can use the `:beta` tag to get the latest build from master.  You can
also use version tags, e.g. `:1.49.1`, `:1.49` or `:1`.

```
$ docker pull rclone/rclone:latest
latest: Pulling from rclone/rclone
Digest: sha256:0e0ced72671989bb837fea8e88578b3fc48371aa45d209663683e24cfdaa0e11
...
$ docker run --rm rclone/rclone:latest version
rclone v1.49.1
- os/arch: linux/amd64
- go version: go1.12.9
```

There are a few command line options to consider when starting an rclone Docker container
from the rclone image.

- You need to mount the host rclone config dir at `/config/rclone` into the Docker
  container. Due to the fact that rclone updates tokens inside its config file, and that
  the update process involves a file rename, you need to mount the whole host rclone
  config dir, not just the single host rclone config file.

- You need to mount a host data dir at `/data` into the Docker container.

- By default, the rclone binary inside a Docker container runs with UID=0 (root).
  As a result, all files created in a run will have UID=0. If your config and data files
  reside on the host with a non-root UID:GID, you need to pass these on the container
  start command line.

- If you want to access the RC interface (either via the API or the Web UI), it is
  required to set the `--rc-addr` to `:5572` in order to connect to it from outside
  the container. An explanation about why this is necessary is present [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200808071950/https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-connection-refused/).
    * NOTE: Users running this container with the docker network set to `host` should
     probably set it to listen to localhost only, with `127.0.0.1:5572` as the value for
      `--rc-addr`

- It is possible to use `rclone mount` inside a userspace Docker container, and expose
  the resulting fuse mount to the host. The exact `docker run` options to do that might
  vary slightly between hosts. See, e.g. the discussion in this
  [thread](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/9448).

  You also need to mount the host `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` for fuse to work inside
  the container.

Here are some commands tested on an Ubuntu 18.04.3 host:

```
# config on host at ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
# data on host at ~/data

# add a remote interactively
docker run --rm -it \
    --volume ~/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \
    --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    rclone/rclone \
    config

# make sure the config is ok by listing the remotes
docker run --rm \
    --volume ~/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \
    --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    rclone/rclone \
    listremotes

# perform mount inside Docker container, expose result to host
mkdir -p ~/data/mount
docker run --rm \
    --volume ~/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \
    --volume ~/data:/data:shared \
    --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    --volume /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro --volume /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \
    --device /dev/fuse --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --security-opt apparmor:unconfined \
    rclone/rclone \
    mount dropbox:Photos /data/mount &
ls ~/data/mount
kill %1
```

## Snap installation {#snap}

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/rclone)

Make sure you have [Snapd installed](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd)

```bash
$ sudo snap install rclone
```
Due to the strict confinement of Snap, rclone snap cannot access real /home/$USER/.config/rclone directory, default config path is as below.

- Default config directory:
    - /home/$USER/snap/rclone/current/.config/rclone

Note: Due to the strict confinement of Snap, `rclone mount` feature is `not` supported.

If mounting is wanted, either install a precompiled binary or enable the relevant option when [installing from source](#source).

Note that this is controlled by [community maintainer](https://github.com/boukendesho/rclone-snap) not the rclone developers so it may be out of date. Its current version is as below.

[![rclone](https://snapcraft.io/rclone/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/rclone)


## Source installation {#source}

Make sure you have git and [Go](https://golang.org/) installed.
Go version 1.18 or newer is required, the latest release is recommended.
You can get it from your package manager, or download it from
[golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl/). Then you can run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/rclone/rclone.git
cd rclone
go build
```

This will check out the rclone source in subfolder rclone, which you can later
modify and send pull requests with. Then it will build the rclone executable
in the same folder. As an initial check you can now run `./rclone version`
(`.\rclone version` on Windows).

Note that on macOS and Windows the [mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/)
command will not be available unless you specify an additional build tag `cmount`.

```
go build -tags cmount
```

This assumes you have a GCC compatible C compiler (GCC or Clang) in your PATH,
as it uses [cgo](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo). But on Windows, the
[cgofuse](https://github.com/winfsp/cgofuse) library that the cmount
implementation is based on, also supports building
[without cgo](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WindowsDLLs), i.e. by setting
environment variable CGO_ENABLED to value 0 (static linking). This is how the
official Windows release of rclone is being built, starting with version 1.59.
It is still possible to build with cgo on Windows as well, by using the MinGW
port of GCC, e.g. by installing it in a [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org)
distribution (make sure you install it in the classic mingw64 subsystem, the
ucrt64 version is not compatible).

Additionally, to build with mount on Windows, you must install the third party
utility [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev/), with the "Developer" feature selected.
If building with cgo, you must also set environment variable CPATH pointing to
the fuse include directory within the WinFsp installation
(normally `C:\Program Files (x86)\WinFsp\inc\fuse`).

You may add arguments `-ldflags -s` to omit symbol table and debug information,
making the executable file smaller, and `-trimpath` to remove references to
local file system paths. The official rclone releases are built with both of these.

```
go build -trimpath -ldflags -s -tags cmount
```

If you want to customize the version string, as reported by
the `rclone version` command, you can set one of the variables `fs.Version`,
`fs.VersionTag` (to keep default suffix but customize the number),
or `fs.VersionSuffix` (to keep default number but customize the suffix).
This can be done from the build command, by adding to the `-ldflags`
argument value as shown below.

```
go build -trimpath -ldflags "-s -X github.com/rclone/rclone/fs.Version=v9.9.9-test" -tags cmount
```

On Windows, the official executables also have the version information,
as well as a file icon, embedded as binary resources. To get that with your
own build you need to run the following command **before** the build command.
It generates a Windows resource system object file, with extension .syso, e.g.
`resource_windows_amd64.syso`, that will be automatically picked up by
future build commands.

```
go run bin/resource_windows.go
```

The above command will generate a resource file containing version information
based on the fs.Version variable in source at the time you run the command,
which means if the value of this variable changes you need to re-run the
command for it to be reflected in the version information. Also, if you
override this version variable in the build command as described above, you
need to do that also when generating the resource file, or else it will still
use the value from the source.

```
go run bin/resource_windows.go -version v9.9.9-test
```

Instead of executing the `go build` command directly, you can run it via the
Makefile. The default target changes the version suffix from "-DEV" to "-beta"
followed by additional commit details, embeds version information binary resources
on Windows, and copies the resulting rclone executable into your GOPATH bin folder
(`$(go env GOPATH)/bin`, which corresponds to `~/go/bin/rclone` by default).

```
make
```

To include mount command on macOS and Windows with Makefile build:

```
make GOTAGS=cmount
```

There are other make targets that can be used for more advanced builds,
such as cross-compiling for all supported os/architectures, and packaging
results into release artifacts.
See [Makefile](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/Makefile)
and [cross-compile.go](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/bin/cross-compile.go)
for details.

Another alternative method for source installation is to download the source,
build and install rclone - all in one operation, as a regular Go package.
The source will be stored it in the Go module cache, and the resulting
executable will be in your GOPATH bin folder (`$(go env GOPATH)/bin`,
which corresponds to `~/go/bin/rclone` by default).

```
go install github.com/rclone/rclone@latest
```

In some situations, rclone executable size might be too big for deployment
in very restricted environments when all backends with large SDKs are included.
To limit binary size unused backends can be commented out in `backends/all/all.go`
and unused commands in `cmd/all/all.go` before building with `go build` or `make`

## Ansible installation {#ansible}

This can be done with [Stefan Weichinger's ansible
role](https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone).

Instructions

  1. `git clone https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone.git` into your local roles-directory
  2. add the role to the hosts you want rclone installed to:

```
    - hosts: rclone-hosts
      roles:
          - rclone
```

## Portable installation {#portable}

As mentioned [above](https://rclone.org/install/#quickstart), rclone is single
executable (`rclone`, or `rclone.exe` on Windows) that you can download as a
zip archive and extract into a location of your choosing. When executing different
commands, it may create files in different locations, such as a configuration file
and various temporary files. By default the locations for these are according to
your operating system, e.g. configuration file in your user profile directory and
temporary files in the standard temporary directory, but you can customize all of
them, e.g. to make a completely self-contained, portable installation.

Run the [config paths](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_paths/) command to see
the locations that rclone will use.

To override them set the corresponding options (as command-line arguments, or as
[environment variables](https://rclone.org/docs/#environment-variables)):
  - [--config](https://rclone.org/docs/#config-config-file)
  - [--cache-dir](https://rclone.org/docs/#cache-dir-dir)
  - [--temp-dir](https://rclone.org/docs/#temp-dir-dir)

## Autostart

After installing and configuring rclone, as described above, you are ready to use rclone
as an interactive command line utility. If your goal is to perform *periodic* operations,
such as a regular [sync](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/), you will probably want
to configure your rclone command in your operating system's scheduler. If you need to
expose *service*-like features, such as [remote control](https://rclone.org/rc/),
[GUI](https://rclone.org/gui/), [serve](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/)
or [mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/), you will often want an rclone
command always running in the background, and configuring it to run in a service infrastructure
may be a better option. Below are some alternatives on how to achieve this on
different operating systems.

NOTE: Before setting up autorun it is highly recommended that you have tested your command
manually from a Command Prompt first.

### Autostart on Windows

The most relevant alternatives for autostart on Windows are:
- Run at user log on using the Startup folder
- Run at user log on, at system startup or at schedule using Task Scheduler
- Run at system startup using Windows service

#### Running in background

Rclone is a console application, so if not starting from an existing Command Prompt,
e.g. when starting rclone.exe from a shortcut, it will open a Command Prompt window.
When configuring rclone to run from task scheduler and windows service you are able
to set it to run hidden in background. From rclone version 1.54 you can also make it
run hidden from anywhere by adding option `--no-console` (it may still flash briefly
when the program starts). Since rclone normally writes information and any error
messages to the console, you must redirect this to a file to be able to see it.
Rclone has a built-in option `--log-file` for that.

Example command to run a sync in background:
```
c:\rclone\rclone.exe sync c:\files remote:/files --no-console --log-file c:\rclone\logs\sync_files.txt
```

#### User account

As mentioned in the [mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) documentation,
mounted drives created as Administrator are not visible to other accounts, not even the
account that was elevated as Administrator. By running the mount command as the
built-in `SYSTEM` user account, it will create drives accessible for everyone on
the system. Both scheduled task and Windows service can be used to achieve this.

NOTE: Remember that when rclone runs as the `SYSTEM` user, the user profile
that it sees will not be yours. This means that if you normally run rclone with
configuration file in the default location, to be able to use the same configuration
when running as the system user you must explicitly tell rclone where to find
it with the [`--config`](https://rclone.org/docs/#config-config-file) option,
or else it will look in the system users profile path (`C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile`).
To test your command manually from a Command Prompt, you can run it with
the [PsExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)
utility from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite, which takes option `-s` to
execute commands as the `SYSTEM` user.

#### Start from Startup folder

To quickly execute an rclone command you can simply create a standard
Windows Explorer shortcut for the complete rclone command you want to run. If you
store this shortcut in the special "Startup" start-menu folder, Windows will
automatically run it at login. To open this folder in Windows Explorer,
enter path `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`,
or `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp` if you want
the command to start for *every* user that logs in.

This is the easiest approach to autostarting of rclone, but it offers no
functionality to set it to run as different user, or to set conditions or
actions on certain events. Setting up a scheduled task as described below
will often give you better results.

#### Start from Task Scheduler

Task Scheduler is an administrative tool built into Windows, and it can be used to
configure rclone to be started automatically in a highly configurable way, e.g.
periodically on a schedule, on user log on, or at system startup. It can run
be configured to run as the current user, or for a mount command that needs to
be available to all users it can run as the `SYSTEM` user.
For technical information, see
https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/taskschd/task-scheduler-start-page.

#### Run as service

For running rclone at system startup, you can create a Windows service that executes
your rclone command, as an alternative to scheduled task configured to run at startup.

##### Mount command built-in service integration

For mount commands, rclone has a built-in Windows service integration via the third-party
WinFsp library it uses. Registering as a regular Windows service easy, as you just have to
execute the built-in PowerShell command `New-Service` (requires administrative privileges).

Example of a PowerShell command that creates a Windows service for mounting
some `remote:/files` as drive letter `X:`, for *all* users (service will be running as the
local system account):

```
New-Service -Name Rclone -BinaryPathName 'c:\rclone\rclone.exe mount remote:/files X: --config c:\rclone\config\rclone.conf --log-file c:\rclone\logs\mount.txt'
```

The [WinFsp service infrastructure](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp/wiki/WinFsp-Service-Architecture)
supports incorporating services for file system implementations, such as rclone,
into its own launcher service, as kind of "child services". This has the additional
advantage that it also implements a network provider that integrates into
Windows standard methods for managing network drives. This is currently not
officially supported by Rclone, but with WinFsp version 2019.3 B2 / v1.5B2 or later
it should be possible through path rewriting as described [here](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3340).

##### Third-party service integration

To Windows service running any rclone command, the excellent third-party utility
[NSSM](http://nssm.cc), the "Non-Sucking Service Manager", can be used.
It includes some advanced features such as adjusting process priority, defining
process environment variables, redirect to file anything written to stdout, and
customized response to different exit codes, with a GUI to configure everything from
(although it can also be used from command line ).

There are also several other alternatives. To mention one more,
[WinSW](https://github.com/winsw/winsw), "Windows Service Wrapper", is worth checking out.
It requires .NET Framework, but it is preinstalled on newer versions of Windows, and it
also provides alternative standalone distributions which includes necessary runtime (.NET 5).
WinSW is a command-line only utility, where you have to manually create an XML file with
service configuration. This may be a drawback for some, but it can also be an advantage
as it is easy to back up and reuse the configuration
settings, without having go through manual steps in a GUI. One thing to note is that
by default it does not restart the service on error, one have to explicit enable this
in the configuration file (via the "onfailure" parameter).

### Autostart on Linux

#### Start as a service

To always run rclone in background, relevant for mount commands etc,
you can use systemd to set up rclone as a system or user service. Running as a
system service ensures that it is run at startup even if the user it is running as
has no active session. Running rclone as a user service ensures that it only
starts after the configured user has logged into the system.

#### Run periodically from cron

To run a periodic command, such as a copy/sync, you can set up a cron job.

# Usage

Rclone is a command line program to manage files on cloud storage.
After [download](https://rclone.org/downloads/) and [install](/install), continue
here to learn how to use it: Initial [configuration](#configure),
what the [basic syntax](#basic-syntax) looks like, describes the
various [subcommands](#subcommands), the various [options](#options),
and more.

Configure
---------

First, you'll need to configure rclone.  As the object storage systems
have quite complicated authentication these are kept in a config file.
(See the [`--config`](#config-config-file) entry for how to find the config
file and choose its location.)

The easiest way to make the config is to run rclone with the config
option:

    rclone config

Basic syntax
-----

Rclone syncs a directory tree from one storage system to another.

Its syntax is like this

    rclone subcommand [options] <parameters> <parameters...>

A `subcommand` is a the rclone operation required, (e.g. `sync`,
`copy`, `ls`).

An `option` is a single letter flag (e.g. `-v`) or a group of single
letter flags (e.g. `-Pv`) or a long flag (e.g. `--progress`). No
options are required. Options can come after the `subcommand` or in
between parameters too or on the end, but only global options can be
used before the `subcommand`. Anything after a `--` option will not be
interpreted as an option so if you need to add a parameter which
starts with a `-` then put a `--` on its own first, eg

    rclone lsf -- -directory-starting-with-dash

A `parameter` is usually a file path or [rclone remote](#syntax-of-remote-paths), eg
`/path/to/file` or `remote:path/to/file` but it can be other things -
the `subcommand` help will tell you what.

Source and destination paths are specified by the name you gave the
storage system in the config file then the sub path, e.g.
"drive:myfolder" to look at "myfolder" in Google drive.

You can define as many storage paths as you like in the config file.

Please use the [`--interactive`/`-i`](#interactive) flag while
learning rclone to avoid accidental data loss.

Subcommands
-----------

rclone uses a system of subcommands.  For example

    rclone ls remote:path # lists a remote
    rclone copy /local/path remote:path # copies /local/path to the remote
    rclone sync --interactive /local/path remote:path # syncs /local/path to the remote

# rclone config

Enter an interactive configuration session.

## Synopsis

Enter an interactive configuration session where you can setup new
remotes and manage existing ones. You may also set or remove a
password to protect your configuration.


```
rclone config [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for config
```

# rclone copy

Copy files from source to dest, skipping identical files.

## Synopsis

Copy the source to the destination.  Does not transfer files that are
identical on source and destination, testing by size and modification
time or MD5SUM.  Doesn't delete files from the destination. If you
want to also delete files from destination, to make it match source,
use the [sync](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/) command instead.

Note that it is always the contents of the directory that is synced,
not the directory itself. So when source:path is a directory, it's the
contents of source:path that are copied, not the directory name and
contents.

To copy single files, use the [copyto](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copyto/)
command instead.

If dest:path doesn't exist, it is created and the source:path contents
go there.

For example

    rclone copy source:sourcepath dest:destpath

Let's say there are two files in sourcepath

    sourcepath/one.txt
    sourcepath/two.txt

This copies them to

    destpath/one.txt
    destpath/two.txt

Not to

    destpath/sourcepath/one.txt
    destpath/sourcepath/two.txt

If you are familiar with `rsync`, rclone always works as if you had
written a trailing `/` - meaning "copy the contents of this directory".
This applies to all commands and whether you are talking about the
source or destination.

See the [--no-traverse](https://rclone.org/docs/#no-traverse) option for controlling
whether rclone lists the destination directory or not.  Supplying this
option when copying a small number of files into a large destination
can speed transfers up greatly.

For example, if you have many files in /path/to/src but only a few of
them change every day, you can copy all the files which have changed
recently very efficiently like this:

    rclone copy --max-age 24h --no-traverse /path/to/src remote:


Rclone will sync the modification times of files and directories if
the backend supports it. If metadata syncing is required then use the
`--metadata` flag.

Note that the modification time and metadata for the root directory
will **not** be synced. See https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7652
for more info.

**Note**: Use the `-P`/`--progress` flag to view real-time transfer statistics.

**Note**: Use the `--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag to test without copying anything.


```
rclone copy source:path dest:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --create-empty-src-dirs   Create empty source dirs on destination after copy
  -h, --help                    help for copy
```

Options shared with other commands are described next.
See the [global flags page](https://rclone.org/flags/) for global options not listed here.

# rclone sync

Make source and dest identical, modifying destination only.

## Synopsis

Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination
only.  Doesn't transfer files that are identical on source and
destination, testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM.
Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files
if necessary (except duplicate objects, see below). If you don't
want to delete files from destination, use the
[copy](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) command instead.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.

    rclone sync --interactive SOURCE remote:DESTINATION

Note that files in the destination won't be deleted if there were any
errors at any point.  Duplicate objects (files with the same name, on
those providers that support it) are also not yet handled.

It is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not the
directory itself. So when source:path is a directory, it's the contents of
source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.  See
extended explanation in the [copy](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) command if unsure.

If dest:path doesn't exist, it is created and the source:path contents
go there.

It is not possible to sync overlapping remotes. However, you may exclude
the destination from the sync with a filter rule or by putting an 
exclude-if-present file inside the destination directory and sync to a
destination that is inside the source directory.

Rclone will sync the modification times of files and directories if
the backend supports it. If metadata syncing is required then use the
`--metadata` flag.

Note that the modification time and metadata for the root directory
will **not** be synced. See https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7652
for more info.

**Note**: Use the `-P`/`--progress` flag to view real-time transfer statistics

**Note**: Use the `rclone dedupe` command to deal with "Duplicate object/directory found in source/destination - ignoring" errors.

# Logger Flags

The `--differ`, `--missing-on-dst`, `--missing-on-src`, `--match` and `--error` flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or
stdout if it is `-`) supplied. What they write is described in the
help below. For example `--differ` will write all paths which are
present on both the source and destination but different.

The `--combined` flag will write a file (or stdout) which contains all
file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path to tell
you what happened to it. These are reminiscent of diff files.

- `= path` means path was found in source and destination and was identical
- `- path` means path was missing on the source, so only in the destination
- `+ path` means path was missing on the destination, so only in the source
- `* path` means path was present in source and destination but different.
- `! path` means there was an error reading or hashing the source or dest.

The `--dest-after` flag writes a list file using the same format flags
as [`lsf`](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsf/#synopsis) (including [customizable options
for hash, modtime, etc.](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsf/#synopsis))
Conceptually it is similar to rsync's `--itemize-changes`, but not identical
-- it should output an accurate list of what will be on the destination
after the sync.

Note that these logger flags have a few limitations, and certain scenarios
are not currently supported:

- `--max-duration` / `CutoffModeHard`
- `--compare-dest` / `--copy-dest`
- server-side moves of an entire dir at once
- High-level retries, because there would be duplicates (use `--retries 1` to disable)
- Possibly some unusual error scenarios

Note also that each file is logged during the sync, as opposed to after, so it
is most useful as a predictor of what SHOULD happen to each file
(which may or may not match what actually DID.)

# rclone move

Move files from source to dest.

## Synopsis

Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination
directory. Rclone will error if the source and destination overlap and
the remote does not support a server-side directory move operation.

To move single files, use the [moveto](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_moveto/)
command instead.

If no filters are in use and if possible this will server-side move
`source:path` into `dest:path`. After this `source:path` will no
longer exist.

Otherwise for each file in `source:path` selected by the filters (if
any) this will move it into `dest:path`.  If possible a server-side
move will be used, otherwise it will copy it (server-side if possible)
into `dest:path` then delete the original (if no errors on copy) in
`source:path`.

If you want to delete empty source directories after move, use the
`--delete-empty-src-dirs` flag.

See the [--no-traverse](https://rclone.org/docs/#no-traverse) option for controlling
whether rclone lists the destination directory or not.  Supplying this
option when moving a small number of files into a large destination
can speed transfers up greatly.

Rclone will sync the modification times of files and directories if
the backend supports it. If metadata syncing is required then use the
`--metadata` flag.

Note that the modification time and metadata for the root directory
will **not** be synced. See https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7652
for more info.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.

**Note**: Use the `-P`/`--progress` flag to view real-time transfer statistics.


```
rclone move source:path dest:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --create-empty-src-dirs   Create empty source dirs on destination after move
      --delete-empty-src-dirs   Delete empty source dirs after move

# rclone delete

Remove the files in path.

## Synopsis

Remove the files in path.  Unlike [purge](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_purge/) it
obeys include/exclude filters so can be used to selectively delete files.

`rclone delete` only deletes files but leaves the directory structure
alone. If you want to delete a directory and all of its contents use
the [purge](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_purge/) command.

If you supply the `--rmdirs` flag, it will remove all empty directories along with it.
You can also use the separate command [rmdir](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rmdir/) or
[rmdirs](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rmdirs/) to delete empty directories only.

For example, to delete all files bigger than 100 MiB, you may first want to
check what would be deleted (use either):

    rclone --min-size 100M lsl remote:path
    rclone --dry-run --min-size 100M delete remote:path

Then proceed with the actual delete:

    rclone --min-size 100M delete remote:path

That reads "delete everything with a minimum size of 100 MiB", hence
delete all files bigger than 100 MiB.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.


```
rclone delete remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help     help for delete
      --rmdirs   rmdirs removes empty directories but leaves root intact
```

# rclone purge

Remove the path and all of its contents.

## Synopsis

Remove the path and all of its contents.  Note that this does not obey
include/exclude filters - everything will be removed.  Use the
[delete](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_delete/) command if you want to selectively
delete files. To delete empty directories only, use command
[rmdir](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rmdir/) or [rmdirs](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rmdirs/).

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.

This removes empty directory given by path. Will not remove the path if it
has any objects in it, not even empty subdirectories. Use
command [rmdirs](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rmdirs/) (or [delete](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_delete/)
with option `--rmdirs`) to do that.

To delete a path and any objects in it, use [purge](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_purge/) command.

# rclone check

Checks the files in the source and destination match.

## Synopsis

Checks the files in the source and destination match.  It compares
sizes and hashes (MD5 or SHA1) and logs a report of files that don't
match.  It doesn't alter the source or destination.

For the [crypt](https://rclone.org/crypt/) remote there is a dedicated command,
[cryptcheck](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_cryptcheck/), that are able to check
the checksums of the encrypted files.

If you supply the `--size-only` flag, it will only compare the sizes not
the hashes as well.  Use this for a quick check.

If you supply the `--download` flag, it will download the data from
both remotes and check them against each other on the fly.  This can
be useful for remotes that don't support hashes or if you really want
to check all the data.

If you supply the `--checkfile HASH` flag with a valid hash name,
the `source:path` must point to a text file in the SUM format.

If you supply the `--one-way` flag, it will only check that files in
the source match the files in the destination, not the other way
around. This means that extra files in the destination that are not in
the source will not be detected.

The `--differ`, `--missing-on-dst`, `--missing-on-src`, `--match`
and `--error` flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or
stdout if it is `-`) supplied. What they write is described in the
help below. For example `--differ` will write all paths which are
present on both the source and destination but different.

The `--combined` flag will write a file (or stdout) which contains all
file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path to tell
you what happened to it. These are reminiscent of diff files.

- `= path` means path was found in source and destination and was identical
- `- path` means path was missing on the source, so only in the destination
- `+ path` means path was missing on the destination, so only in the source
- `* path` means path was present in source and destination but different.
- `! path` means there was an error reading or hashing the source or dest.

The default number of parallel checks is 8. See the [--checkers=N](https://rclone.org/docs/#checkers-n)
option for more information.


```
rclone check source:path dest:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -C, --checkfile string        Treat source:path as a SUM file with hashes of given type
      --combined string         Make a combined report of changes to this file
      --differ string           Report all non-matching files to this file
      --download                Check by downloading rather than with hash
      --error string            Report all files with errors (hashing or reading) to this file
  -h, --help                    help for check
      --match string            Report all matching files to this file
      --missing-on-dst string   Report all files missing from the destination to this file
      --missing-on-src string   Report all files missing from the source to this file
      --one-way                 Check one way only, source files must exist on remote

# rclone ls

List the objects in the path with size and path.

## Synopsis

Lists the objects in the source path to standard output in a human
readable format with size and path. Recurses by default.

Eg

    $ rclone ls swift:bucket
        60295 bevajer5jef
        90613 canole
        94467 diwogej7
        37600 fubuwic


Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.

There are several related list commands

  * `ls` to list size and path of objects only
  * `lsl` to list modification time, size and path of objects only
  * `lsd` to list directories only
  * `lsf` to list objects and directories in easy to parse format
  * `lsjson` to list objects and directories in JSON format

# rclone lsd

List all directories/containers/buckets in the path.

## Synopsis

Lists the directories in the source path to standard output. Does not
recurse by default.  Use the `-R` flag to recurse.

This command lists the total size of the directory (if known, -1 if
not), the modification time (if known, the current time if not), the
number of objects in the directory (if known, -1 if not) and the name
of the directory, Eg

    $ rclone lsd swift:
          494000 2018-04-26 08:43:20     10000 10000files
              65 2018-04-26 08:43:20         1 1File

Or

    $ rclone lsd drive:test
              -1 2016-10-17 17:41:53        -1 1000files
              -1 2017-01-03 14:40:54        -1 2500files
              -1 2017-07-08 14:39:28        -1 4000files

If you just want the directory names use `rclone lsf --dirs-only`.


Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.

There are several related list commands

  * `ls` to list size and path of objects only
  * `lsl` to list modification time, size and path of objects only

# rclone md5sum

Produces an md5sum file for all the objects in the path.

## Synopsis

Produces an md5sum file for all the objects in the path.  This
is in the same format as the standard md5sum tool produces.

By default, the hash is requested from the remote.  If MD5 is
not supported by the remote, no hash will be returned.  With the
download flag, the file will be downloaded from the remote and
hashed locally enabling MD5 for any remote.

For other algorithms, see the [hashsum](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_hashsum/)
command. Running `rclone md5sum remote:path` is equivalent
to running `rclone hashsum MD5 remote:path`.

This command can also hash data received on standard input (stdin),
by not passing a remote:path, or by passing a hyphen as remote:path
when there is data to read (if not, the hyphen will be treated literally,
as a relative path).


```
rclone md5sum remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --base64               Output base64 encoded hashsum
  -C, --checkfile string     Validate hashes against a given SUM file instead of printing them
      --download             Download the file and hash it locally; if this flag is not specified, the hash is requested from the remote
  -h, --help                 help for md5sum
      --output-file string   Output hashsums to a file rather than the terminal
```

Options shared with other commands are described next.

# rclone sha1sum

Produces an sha1sum file for all the objects in the path.

## Synopsis

Produces an sha1sum file for all the objects in the path.  This

# rclone size

Prints the total size and number of objects in remote:path.

## Synopsis

Counts objects in the path and calculates the total size. Prints the
result to standard output.

By default the output is in human-readable format, but shows values in
both human-readable format as well as the raw numbers (global option
`--human-readable` is not considered). Use option `--json`
to format output as JSON instead.

Recurses by default, use `--max-depth 1` to stop the
recursion.

Some backends do not always provide file sizes, see for example
[Google Photos](https://rclone.org/googlephotos/#size) and
[Google Docs](https://rclone.org/drive/#limitations-of-google-docs).
Rclone will then show a notice in the log indicating how many such
files were encountered, and count them in as empty files in the output
of the size command.


```
rclone size remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for size
      --json   Format output as JSON
```

# rclone version

Show the version number.

## Synopsis

Show the rclone version number, the go version, the build target
OS and architecture, the runtime OS and kernel version and bitness,
build tags and the type of executable (static or dynamic).

For example:

    $ rclone version
    rclone v1.55.0
    - os/version: ubuntu 18.04 (64 bit)
    - os/kernel: 4.15.0-136-generic (x86_64)
    - os/type: linux
    - os/arch: amd64
    - go/version: go1.16
    - go/linking: static
    - go/tags: none

Note: before rclone version 1.55 the os/type and os/arch lines were merged,
      and the "go/version" line was tagged as "go version".

If you supply the --check flag, then it will do an online check to
compare your version with the latest release and the latest beta.

    $ rclone version --check
    yours:  1.42.0.6
    latest: 1.42          (released 2018-06-16)
    beta:   1.42.0.5      (released 2018-06-17)

Or

    $ rclone version --check
    yours:  1.41
    latest: 1.42          (released 2018-06-16)
      upgrade: https://downloads.rclone.org/v1.42
    beta:   1.42.0.5      (released 2018-06-17)

# rclone dedupe

Interactively find duplicate filenames and delete/rename them.

## Synopsis

By default `dedupe` interactively finds files with duplicate
names and offers to delete all but one or rename them to be
different. This is known as deduping by name.

Deduping by name is only useful with a small group of backends (e.g. Google Drive,
Opendrive) that can have duplicate file names. It can be run on wrapping backends
(e.g. crypt) if they wrap a backend which supports duplicate file
names.

However if `--by-hash` is passed in then dedupe will find files with
duplicate hashes instead which will work on any backend which supports
at least one hash. This can be used to find files with duplicate
content. This is known as deduping by hash.

If deduping by name, first rclone will merge directories with the same
name.  It will do this iteratively until all the identically named
directories have been merged.

Next, if deduping by name, for every group of duplicate file names /
hashes, it will delete all but one identical file it finds without
confirmation.  This means that for most duplicated files the `dedupe` command will not be interactive.

`dedupe` considers files to be identical if they have the
same file path and the same hash. If the backend does not support hashes (e.g. crypt wrapping
Google Drive) then they will never be found to be identical. If you
use the `--size-only` flag then files will be considered
identical if they have the same size (any hash will be ignored). This
can be useful on crypt backends which do not support hashes.

Next rclone will resolve the remaining duplicates. Exactly which
action is taken depends on the dedupe mode. By default, rclone will
interactively query the user for each one.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.

Here is an example run.

Before - with duplicates

    $ rclone lsl drive:dupes
      6048320 2016-03-05 16:23:16.798000000 one.txt

Dedupe can be run non interactively using the `--dedupe-mode` flag or by using an extra parameter with the same value

  * `--dedupe-mode interactive` - interactive as above.
  * `--dedupe-mode skip` - removes identical files then skips anything left.
  * `--dedupe-mode first` - removes identical files then keeps the first one.
  * `--dedupe-mode newest` - removes identical files then keeps the newest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode oldest` - removes identical files then keeps the oldest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode largest` - removes identical files then keeps the largest one.

Or

    rclone dedupe rename "drive:Google Photos"


```
rclone dedupe [mode] remote:path [flags]
```

# rclone about

Get quota information from the remote.

## Synopsis

Prints quota information about a remote to standard
output. The output is typically used, free, quota and trash contents.

E.g. Typical output from `rclone about remote:` is:

    Total:   17 GiB
    Used:    7.444 GiB
    Free:    1.315 GiB
    Trashed: 100.000 MiB
    Other:   8.241 GiB

Where the fields are:

  * Total: Total size available.
  * Used: Total size used.
  * Free: Total space available to this user.
  * Trashed: Total space used by trash.
  * Other: Total amount in other storage (e.g. Gmail, Google Photos).
  * Objects: Total number of objects in the storage.

All sizes are in number of bytes.

Applying a `--full` flag to the command prints the bytes in full, e.g.

    Total:   18253611008
    Used:    7993453766
    Free:    1411001220
    Trashed: 104857602
    Other:   8849156022

A `--json` flag generates conveniently machine-readable output, e.g.

    {
        "total": 18253611008,
        "used": 7993453766,
        "trashed": 104857602,
        "other": 8849156022,
        "free": 1411001220
    }

Not all backends print all fields. Information is not included if it is not
provided by a backend. Where the value is unlimited it is omitted.

Some backends does not support the `rclone about` command at all,
see complete list in [documentation](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features).


```
rclone about remote: [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --full   Full numbers instead of human-readable
  -h, --help   help for about
      --json   Format output as JSON
```

## Synopsis

Remote authorization. Used to authorize a remote or headless
rclone from a machine with a browser - use as instructed by
rclone config.

Use --auth-no-open-browser to prevent rclone to open auth
link in default browser automatically.

Use --template to generate HTML output via a custom Go template. If a blank string is provided as an argument to this flag, the default template is used.

```
rclone authorize [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --auth-no-open-browser   Do not automatically open auth link in default browser
  -h, --help                   help for authorize
      --template string        The path to a custom Go template for generating HTML responses

# rclone backend

Run a backend-specific command.

## Synopsis

This runs a backend-specific command. The commands themselves (except
for "help" and "features") are defined by the backends and you should
see the backend docs for definitions.

You can discover what commands a backend implements by using

    rclone backend help remote:
    rclone backend help <backendname>

You can also discover information about the backend using (see
[operations/fsinfo](https://rclone.org/rc/#operations-fsinfo) in the remote control docs
for more info).

    rclone backend features remote:

Pass options to the backend command with -o. This should be key=value or key, e.g.:

    rclone backend stats remote:path stats -o format=json -o long

Pass arguments to the backend by placing them on the end of the line

    rclone backend cleanup remote:path file1 file2 file3

Note to run these commands on a running backend then see
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command) in the rc docs.


```
rclone backend <command> remote:path [opts] <args> [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help                 help for backend
      --json                 Always output in JSON format
  -o, --option stringArray   Option in the form name=value or name
```

Options shared with other commands are described next.

# rclone bisync

Perform bidirectional synchronization between two paths.

## Synopsis

Perform bidirectional synchronization between two paths.

[Bisync](https://rclone.org/bisync/) provides a
bidirectional cloud sync solution in rclone.
It retains the Path1 and Path2 filesystem listings from the prior run.
On each successive run it will:
- list files on Path1 and Path2, and check for changes on each side.
  Changes include `New`, `Newer`, `Older`, and `Deleted` files.
- Propagate changes on Path1 to Path2, and vice-versa.

Bisync is **in beta** and is considered an **advanced command**, so use with care.
Make sure you have read and understood the entire [manual](https://rclone.org/bisync)
(especially the [Limitations](https://rclone.org/bisync/#limitations) section) before using,
or data loss can result. Questions can be asked in the [Rclone Forum](https://forum.rclone.org/).

See [full bisync description](https://rclone.org/bisync/) for details.

# rclone cat

Concatenates any files and sends them to stdout.

## Synopsis

Sends any files to standard output.

You can use it like this to output a single file

    rclone cat remote:path/to/file

Or like this to output any file in dir or its subdirectories.

    rclone cat remote:path/to/dir

Or like this to output any .txt files in dir or its subdirectories.

    rclone --include "*.txt" cat remote:path/to/dir

Use the `--head` flag to print characters only at the start, `--tail` for
the end and `--offset` and `--count` to print a section in the middle.
Note that if offset is negative it will count from the end, so
`--offset -1 --count 1` is equivalent to `--tail 1`.

Use the `--separator` flag to print a separator value between files. Be sure to
shell-escape special characters. For example, to print a newline between
files, use:

* bash:

      rclone --include "*.txt" --separator $'\n' cat remote:path/to/dir

* powershell:

      rclone --include "*.txt" --separator "`n" cat remote:path/to/dir


```
rclone cat remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --count int          Only print N characters (default -1)
      --discard            Discard the output instead of printing
      --head int           Only print the first N characters
  -h, --help               help for cat
      --offset int         Start printing at offset N (or from end if -ve)
      --separator string   Separator to use between objects when printing multiple files
      --tail int           Only print the last N characters
```

# rclone checksum

Checks the files in the destination against a SUM file.

## Synopsis

Checks that hashsums of destination files match the SUM file.
It compares hashes (MD5, SHA1, etc) and logs a report of files which
don't match.  It doesn't alter the file system.

The sumfile is treated as the source and the dst:path is treated as
the destination for the purposes of the output.

If you supply the `--download` flag, it will download the data from the remote
and calculate the content hash on the fly.  This can be useful for remotes
that don't support hashes or if you really want to check all the data.

Note that hash values in the SUM file are treated as case insensitive.

If you supply the `--one-way` flag, it will only check that files in
the source match the files in the destination, not the other way
around. This means that extra files in the destination that are not in
the source will not be detected.

The `--differ`, `--missing-on-dst`, `--missing-on-src`, `--match`
and `--error` flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or
stdout if it is `-`) supplied. What they write is described in the
help below. For example `--differ` will write all paths which are
present on both the source and destination but different.

The `--combined` flag will write a file (or stdout) which contains all
file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path to tell
you what happened to it. These are reminiscent of diff files.

- `= path` means path was found in source and destination and was identical
- `- path` means path was missing on the source, so only in the destination
- `+ path` means path was missing on the destination, so only in the source
- `* path` means path was present in source and destination but different.
- `! path` means there was an error reading or hashing the source or dest.

The default number of parallel checks is 8. See the [--checkers=N](https://rclone.org/docs/#checkers-n)
option for more information.


```

# rclone completion bash

Output bash completion script for rclone.

## Synopsis

Generates a bash shell autocompletion script for rclone.

By default, when run without any arguments, 

    rclone completion bash

the generated script will be written to

    /etc/bash_completion.d/rclone

and so rclone will probably need to be run as root, or with sudo.

If you supply a path to a file as the command line argument, then 
the generated script will be written to that file, in which case
you should not need root privileges.

If output_file is "-", then the output will be written to stdout.

If you have installed the script into the default location, you
can logout and login again to use the autocompletion script.

Alternatively, you can source the script directly

    . /path/to/my_bash_completion_scripts/rclone

and the autocompletion functionality will be added to your
current shell.


```
rclone completion bash [output_file] [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for bash
```

See the [global flags page](https://rclone.org/flags/) for global options not listed here.

* [rclone completion](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_completion/)	 - Output completion script for a given shell.

# rclone completion fish

Output fish completion script for rclone.

## Synopsis

Generates a fish autocompletion script for rclone.

This writes to /etc/fish/completions/rclone.fish by default so will
probably need to be run with sudo or as root, e.g.

    sudo rclone completion fish

Logout and login again to use the autocompletion scripts, or source
them directly

    . /etc/fish/completions/rclone.fish

If you supply a command line argument the script will be written
there.

If output_file is "-", then the output will be written to stdout.


```
rclone completion fish [output_file] [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for fish
```

See the [global flags page](https://rclone.org/flags/) for global options not listed here.

## Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for powershell.

To load completions in your current shell session:

    rclone completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

To load completions for every new session, add the output of the above command
to your powershell profile.

If output_file is "-" or missing, then the output will be written to stdout.


```
rclone completion powershell [output_file] [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for powershell
```

This writes to /usr/share/zsh/vendor-completions/_rclone by default so will
probably need to be run with sudo or as root, e.g.

    sudo rclone completion zsh

Logout and login again to use the autocompletion scripts, or source
them directly

    autoload -U compinit && compinit

If you supply a command line argument the script will be written
there.

If output_file is "-", then the output will be written to stdout.


```
rclone completion zsh [output_file] [flags]

# rclone config create

Create a new remote with name, type and options.

## Synopsis

Create a new remote of `name` with `type` and options.  The options
should be passed in pairs of `key` `value` or as `key=value`.

For example, to make a swift remote of name myremote using auto config
you would do:

    rclone config create myremote swift env_auth true
    rclone config create myremote swift env_auth=true

So for example if you wanted to configure a Google Drive remote but
using remote authorization you would do this:

    rclone config create mydrive drive config_is_local=false

Note that if the config process would normally ask a question the
default is taken (unless `--non-interactive` is used).  Each time
that happens rclone will print or DEBUG a message saying how to
affect the value taken.

If any of the parameters passed is a password field, then rclone will
automatically obscure them if they aren't already obscured before
putting them in the config file.

**NB** If the password parameter is 22 characters or longer and
consists only of base64 characters then rclone can get confused about
whether the password is already obscured or not and put unobscured
passwords into the config file. If you want to be 100% certain that
the passwords get obscured then use the `--obscure` flag, or if you
are 100% certain you are already passing obscured passwords then use
`--no-obscure`.  You can also set obscured passwords using the
`rclone config password` command.

The flag `--non-interactive` is for use by applications that wish to
configure rclone themselves, rather than using rclone's text based
configuration questions. If this flag is set, and rclone needs to ask
the user a question, a JSON blob will be returned with the question in
it.

This will look something like (some irrelevant detail removed):

```
{
    "State": "*oauth-islocal,teamdrive,,",
    "Option": {
        "Name": "config_is_local",
        "Help": "Use web browser to automatically authenticate rclone with remote?\n * Say Y if the machine running rclone has a web browser you can use\n * Say N if running rclone on a (remote) machine without web browser access\nIf not sure try Y. If Y failed, try N.\n",
        "Default": true,
        "Examples": [
            {
                "Value": "true",
                "Help": "Yes"
            },
            {
                "Value": "false",
                "Help": "No"
            }
        ],
        "Required": false,
        "IsPassword": false,
        "Type": "bool",
        "Exclusive": true,
    },
    "Error": "",
}
```

The format of `Option` is the same as returned by `rclone config
providers`. The question should be asked to the user and returned to
rclone as the `--result` option along with the `--state` parameter.

The keys of `Option` are used as follows:

- `Name` - name of variable - show to user
- `Help` - help text. Hard wrapped at 80 chars. Any URLs should be clicky.
- `Default` - default value - return this if the user just wants the default.
- `Examples` - the user should be able to choose one of these
- `Required` - the value should be non-empty
- `IsPassword` - the value is a password and should be edited as such
- `Type` - type of value, eg `bool`, `string`, `int` and others
- `Exclusive` - if set no free-form entry allowed only the `Examples`
- Irrelevant keys `Provider`, `ShortOpt`, `Hide`, `NoPrefix`, `Advanced`

If `Error` is set then it should be shown to the user at the same
time as the question.

    rclone config update name --continue --state "*oauth-islocal,teamdrive,," --result "true"

Note that when using `--continue` all passwords should be passed in
the clear (not obscured). Any default config values should be passed
in with each invocation of `--continue`.

At the end of the non interactive process, rclone will return a result
with `State` as empty string.

If `--all` is passed then rclone will ask all the config questions,
not just the post config questions. Any parameters are used as
defaults for questions as usual.

Note that `bin/config.py` in the rclone source implements this protocol
as a readable demonstration.


```
rclone config create name type [key value]* [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --all               Ask the full set of config questions
      --continue          Continue the configuration process with an answer
  -h, --help              help for create
      --no-obscure        Force any passwords not to be obscured
      --non-interactive   Don't interact with user and return questions
      --obscure           Force any passwords to be obscured
      --result string     Result - use with --continue
      --state string      State - use with --continue

This command sets, clears and checks the encryption for the config file using
the subcommands below.


## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for encryption
```

See the [global flags page](https://rclone.org/flags/) for global options not listed here.

* [rclone config encryption set](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_encryption_set/)	 - Set or change the config file encryption password

# rclone config encryption check

Check that the config file is encrypted

## Synopsis

This checks the config file is encrypted and that you can decrypt it.

It will attempt to decrypt the config using the password you supply.

If decryption fails it will return a non-zero exit code if using
`--password-command`, otherwise it will prompt again for the password.

If the config file is not encrypted it will return a non zero exit code.


```
rclone config encryption check [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for check
```

See the [global flags page](https://rclone.org/flags/) for global options not listed here.

## See Also

* [rclone config encryption](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_encryption/)	 - set, remove and check the encryption for the config file

# rclone config encryption remove

Remove the config file encryption password

## Synopsis

Remove the config file encryption password

This removes the config file encryption, returning it to un-encrypted.

If `--password-command` is in use, this will be called to supply the old config
password.

If the config was not encrypted then no error will be returned and
this command will do nothing.


```
rclone config encryption remove [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for remove
```

See the [global flags page](https://rclone.org/flags/) for global options not listed here.

## See Also

* [rclone config encryption](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_encryption/)	 - set, remove and check the encryption for the config file

# rclone config encryption set

Set or change the config file encryption password

## Synopsis

This command sets or changes the config file encryption password.

If there was no config password set then it sets a new one, otherwise
it changes the existing config password.

Note that if you are changing an encryption password using
`--password-command` then this will be called once to decrypt the
config using the old password and then again to read the new
password to re-encrypt the config.

When `--password-command` is called to change the password then the
environment variable `RCLONE_PASSWORD_CHANGE=1` will be set. So if
changing passwords programatically you can use the environment
variable to distinguish which password you must supply.

Alternatively you can remove the password first (with `rclone config
encryption remove`), then set it again with this command which may be
easier if you don't mind the unecrypted config file being on the disk
briefly.


```
rclone config encryption set [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for set
```

# rclone config password

Update password in an existing remote.

## Synopsis

Update an existing remote's password. The password
should be passed in pairs of `key` `password` or as `key=password`.
The `password` should be passed in in clear (unobscured).

For example, to set password of a remote of name myremote you would do:

    rclone config password myremote fieldname mypassword
    rclone config password myremote fieldname=mypassword

This command is obsolete now that "config update" and "config create"
both support obscuring passwords directly.

# rclone config redacted

Print redacted (decrypted) config file, or the redacted config for a single remote.

## Synopsis

This prints a redacted copy of the config file, either the
whole config file or for a given remote.

The config file will be redacted by replacing all passwords and other
sensitive info with XXX.

This makes the config file suitable for posting online for support.

It should be double checked before posting as the redaction may not be perfect.

# rclone config update

Update options in an existing remote.

## Synopsis

Update an existing remote's options. The options should be passed in
pairs of `key` `value` or as `key=value`.

For example, to update the env_auth field of a remote of name myremote
you would do:

    rclone config update myremote env_auth true
    rclone config update myremote env_auth=true

If the remote uses OAuth the token will be updated, if you don't
require this add an extra parameter thus:

    rclone config update myremote env_auth=true config_refresh_token=false

Note that if the config process would normally ask a question the
default is taken (unless `--non-interactive` is used).  Each time
that happens rclone will print or DEBUG a message saying how to
affect the value taken.

If any of the parameters passed is a password field, then rclone will
automatically obscure them if they aren't already obscured before
putting them in the config file.

**NB** If the password parameter is 22 characters or longer and
consists only of base64 characters then rclone can get confused about
whether the password is already obscured or not and put unobscured
passwords into the config file. If you want to be 100% certain that
the passwords get obscured then use the `--obscure` flag, or if you
are 100% certain you are already passing obscured passwords then use
`--no-obscure`.  You can also set obscured passwords using the
`rclone config password` command.

The flag `--non-interactive` is for use by applications that wish to
configure rclone themselves, rather than using rclone's text based
configuration questions. If this flag is set, and rclone needs to ask
the user a question, a JSON blob will be returned with the question in
it.

providers`. The question should be asked to the user and returned to
rclone as the `--result` option along with the `--state` parameter.

The keys of `Option` are used as follows:

- `Name` - name of variable - show to user
- `Help` - help text. Hard wrapped at 80 chars. Any URLs should be clicky.
- `Default` - default value - return this if the user just wants the default.
- `Examples` - the user should be able to choose one of these
- `Required` - the value should be non-empty
- `IsPassword` - the value is a password and should be edited as such
- `Type` - type of value, eg `bool`, `string`, `int` and others
- `Exclusive` - if set no free-form entry allowed only the `Examples`
- Irrelevant keys `Provider`, `ShortOpt`, `Hide`, `NoPrefix`, `Advanced`

If `Error` is set then it should be shown to the user at the same
time as the question.

    rclone config update name --continue --state "*oauth-islocal,teamdrive,," --result "true"

Note that when using `--continue` all passwords should be passed in
the clear (not obscured). Any default config values should be passed
in with each invocation of `--continue`.

At the end of the non interactive process, rclone will return a result
with `State` as empty string.

If `--all` is passed then rclone will ask all the config questions,
not just the post config questions. Any parameters are used as
defaults for questions as usual.

Note that `bin/config.py` in the rclone source implements this protocol
as a readable demonstration.


```
rclone config update name [key value]+ [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --all               Ask the full set of config questions
      --continue          Continue the configuration process with an answer
  -h, --help              help for update
      --no-obscure        Force any passwords not to be obscured
      --non-interactive   Don't interact with user and return questions
      --obscure           Force any passwords to be obscured
      --result string     Result - use with --continue
      --state string      State - use with --continue
```

# rclone copyto

Copy files from source to dest, skipping identical files.

## Synopsis

If source:path is a file or directory then it copies it to a file or
directory named dest:path.

This can be used to upload single files to other than their current
name.  If the source is a directory then it acts exactly like the
[copy](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) command.

So

    rclone copyto src dst

where src and dst are rclone paths, either remote:path or
/path/to/local or C:\windows\path\if\on\windows.

This will:

    if src is file
        copy it to dst, overwriting an existing file if it exists
    if src is directory
        copy it to dst, overwriting existing files if they exist
        see copy command for full details

This doesn't transfer files that are identical on src and dst, testing
by size and modification time or MD5SUM.  It doesn't delete files from
the destination.

**Note**: Use the `-P`/`--progress` flag to view real-time transfer statistics


```
rclone copyto source:path dest:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for copyto
```

# rclone copyurl

Copy the contents of the URL supplied content to dest:path.

## Synopsis

Download a URL's content and copy it to the destination without saving
it in temporary storage.

Setting `--auto-filename` will attempt to automatically determine the
filename from the URL (after any redirections) and used in the
destination path.

With `--auto-filename-header` in addition, if a specific filename is
set in HTTP headers, it will be used instead of the name from the URL.
With `--print-filename` in addition, the resulting file name will be
printed.

Setting `--no-clobber` will prevent overwriting file on the 
destination if there is one with the same name.

Setting `--stdout` or making the output file name `-`
will cause the output to be written to standard output.

## Troublshooting

If you can't get `rclone copyurl` to work then here are some things you can try:

- `--disable-http2` rclone will use HTTP2 if available - try disabling it
- `--bind 0.0.0.0` rclone will use IPv6 if available - try disabling it
- `--bind ::0` to disable IPv4
- `--user agent curl` - some sites have whitelists for curl's user-agent - try that
- Make sure the site works with `curl` directly



```
rclone copyurl https://example.com dest:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -a, --auto-filename     Get the file name from the URL and use it for destination file path
      --header-filename   Get the file name from the Content-Disposition header
  -h, --help              help for copyurl
      --no-clobber        Prevent overwriting file with same name
  -p, --print-filename    Print the resulting name from --auto-filename
      --stdout            Write the output to stdout rather than a file
```

Options shared with other commands are described next.

# rclone cryptcheck

Cryptcheck checks the integrity of an encrypted remote.

## Synopsis

Checks a remote against a [crypted](https://rclone.org/crypt/) remote. This is the equivalent
of running rclone [check](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/), but able to check the
checksums of the encrypted remote.

For it to work the underlying remote of the cryptedremote must support
some kind of checksum.

It works by reading the nonce from each file on the cryptedremote: and
using that to encrypt each file on the remote:.  It then checks the
checksum of the underlying file on the cryptedremote: against the
checksum of the file it has just encrypted.

Use it like this

    rclone cryptcheck /path/to/files encryptedremote:path

You can use it like this also, but that will involve downloading all
the files in remote:path.

    rclone cryptcheck remote:path encryptedremote:path

After it has run it will log the status of the encryptedremote:.

If you supply the `--one-way` flag, it will only check that files in
the source match the files in the destination, not the other way
around. This means that extra files in the destination that are not in
the source will not be detected.

The `--differ`, `--missing-on-dst`, `--missing-on-src`, `--match`
and `--error` flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or
stdout if it is `-`) supplied. What they write is described in the
help below. For example `--differ` will write all paths which are
present on both the source and destination but different.

The `--combined` flag will write a file (or stdout) which contains all
file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path to tell
you what happened to it. These are reminiscent of diff files.

- `= path` means path was found in source and destination and was identical
- `- path` means path was missing on the source, so only in the destination
- `+ path` means path was missing on the destination, so only in the source
- `* path` means path was present in source and destination but different.
- `! path` means there was an error reading or hashing the source or dest.

The default number of parallel checks is 8. See the [--checkers=N](https://rclone.org/docs/#checkers-n)
option for more information.


```
rclone cryptcheck remote:path cryptedremote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --combined string         Make a combined report of changes to this file
      --differ string           Report all non-matching files to this file
      --error string            Report all files with errors (hashing or reading) to this file
  -h, --help                    help for cryptcheck
      --match string            Report all matching files to this file
      --missing-on-dst string   Report all files missing from the destination to this file
      --missing-on-src string   Report all files missing from the source to this file
      --one-way                 Check one way only, source files must exist on remote

# rclone cryptdecode

Cryptdecode returns unencrypted file names.

## Synopsis

Returns unencrypted file names when provided with a list of encrypted file
names. List limit is 10 items.

If you supply the `--reverse` flag, it will return encrypted file names.

# rclone gitannex

Speaks with git-annex over stdin/stdout.

## Synopsis

Rclone's `gitannex` subcommand enables [git-annex] to store and retrieve content
from an rclone remote. It is meant to be run by git-annex, not directly by
users.

[git-annex]: https://git-annex.branchable.com/

Installation on Linux
---------------------

1. Skip this step if your version of git-annex is [10.20240430] or newer.
   Otherwise, you must create a symlink somewhere on your PATH with a particular
   name. This symlink helps git-annex tell rclone it wants to run the "gitannex"
   subcommand.

   ```sh
   # Create the helper symlink in "$HOME/bin".
   ln -s "$(realpath rclone)" "$HOME/bin/git-annex-remote-rclone-builtin"

   # Verify the new symlink is on your PATH.
   which git-annex-remote-rclone-builtin
   ```

   [10.20240430]: https://git-annex.branchable.com/news/version_10.20240430/

2. Add a new remote to your git-annex repo. This new remote will connect
   git-annex with the `rclone gitannex` subcommand.

   Start by asking git-annex to describe the remote's available configuration
   parameters.

   ```sh
   # If you skipped step 1:
   git annex initremote MyRemote type=rclone --whatelse

   # If you created a symlink in step 1:
   git annex initremote MyRemote type=external externaltype=rclone-builtin --whatelse
    ```

   > **NOTE**: If you're porting an existing [git-annex-remote-rclone] remote to
   > use `rclone gitannex`, you can probably reuse the configuration parameters
   > verbatim without renaming them. Check parameter synonyms with `--whatelse`
   > as shown above.
   >
   > [git-annex-remote-rclone]: https://github.com/git-annex-remote-rclone/git-annex-remote-rclone

   The following example creates a new git-annex remote named "MyRemote" that
   will use the rclone remote named "SomeRcloneRemote". That rclone remote must
   be one configured in your rclone.conf file, which can be located with `rclone
   config file`.

   ```sh
   git annex initremote MyRemote         \
       type=external                     \
       externaltype=rclone-builtin       \
       encryption=none                   \
       rcloneremotename=SomeRcloneRemote \
       rcloneprefix=git-annex-content    \

3. Before you trust this command with your precious data, be sure to **test the
   remote**. This command is very new and has not been tested on many rclone
   backends. Caveat emptor!

   ```sh
   git annex testremote MyRemote
   ```

Happy annexing!


```
rclone gitannex [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for gitannex
```

# rclone hashsum

Produces a hashsum file for all the objects in the path.

## Synopsis

Produces a hash file for all the objects in the path using the hash
named.  The output is in the same format as the standard
md5sum/sha1sum tool.

By default, the hash is requested from the remote.  If the hash is
not supported by the remote, no hash will be returned.  With the
download flag, the file will be downloaded from the remote and
hashed locally enabling any hash for any remote.

For the MD5 and SHA1 algorithms there are also dedicated commands,
[md5sum](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_md5sum/) and [sha1sum](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sha1sum/).

This command can also hash data received on standard input (stdin),
by not passing a remote:path, or by passing a hyphen as remote:path
when there is data to read (if not, the hyphen will be treated literally,
as a relative path).

Run without a hash to see the list of all supported hashes, e.g.

    $ rclone hashsum
    Supported hashes are:
      * md5
      * sha1
      * whirlpool
      * crc32
      * sha256

Then

    $ rclone hashsum MD5 remote:path

Note that hash names are case insensitive and values are output in lower case.


```
rclone hashsum [<hash> remote:path] [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --base64               Output base64 encoded hashsum
  -C, --checkfile string     Validate hashes against a given SUM file instead of printing them
      --download             Download the file and hash it locally; if this flag is not specified, the hash is requested from the remote
  -h, --help                 help for hashsum
      --output-file string   Output hashsums to a file rather than the terminal
```

# rclone link

Generate public link to file/folder.

## Synopsis

Create, retrieve or remove a public link to the given file or folder.

    rclone link remote:path/to/file
    rclone link remote:path/to/folder/
    rclone link --unlink remote:path/to/folder/
    rclone link --expire 1d remote:path/to/file

If you supply the --expire flag, it will set the expiration time
otherwise it will use the default (100 years). **Note** not all
backends support the --expire flag - if the backend doesn't support it
then the link returned won't expire.

Use the --unlink flag to remove existing public links to the file or
folder. **Note** not all backends support "--unlink" flag - those that
don't will just ignore it.

If successful, the last line of the output will contain the
link. Exact capabilities depend on the remote, but the link will
always by default be created with the least constraints – e.g. no
expiry, no password protection, accessible without account.


```
rclone link remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --expire Duration   The amount of time that the link will be valid (default off)
  -h, --help              help for link
      --unlink            Remove existing public link to file/folder
```

# rclone listremotes

List all the remotes in the config file and defined in environment variables.

## Synopsis


Lists all the available remotes from the config file, or the remotes matching
an optional filter.

Prints the result in human-readable format by default, and as a simple list of
remote names, or if used with flag `--long` a tabular format including
the remote names, types and descriptions. Using flag `--json` produces
machine-readable output instead, which always includes all attributes - including
the source (file or environment).

Result can be filtered by a filter argument which applies to all attributes,
and/or filter flags specific for each attribute. The values must be specified
according to regular rclone filtering pattern syntax.


```
rclone listremotes [<filter>] [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --description string   Filter remotes by description
  -h, --help                 help for listremotes
      --json                 Format output as JSON
      --long                 Show type and description in addition to name
      --name string          Filter remotes by name
      --order-by string      Instructions on how to order the result, e.g. 'type,name=descending'
      --source string        Filter remotes by source, e.g. 'file' or 'environment'
      --type string          Filter remotes by type
```

# rclone lsf

List directories and objects in remote:path formatted for parsing.

## Synopsis

List the contents of the source path (directories and objects) to
standard output in a form which is easy to parse by scripts.  By
default this will just be the names of the objects and directories,
one per line.  The directories will have a / suffix.

Eg

    $ rclone lsf swift:bucket
    bevajer5jef
    canole
    diwogej7
    ferejej3gux/
    fubuwic

Use the `--format` option to control what gets listed.  By default this
is just the path, but you can use these parameters to control the
output:

    p - path
    s - size
    t - modification time
    h - hash
    i - ID of object
    o - Original ID of underlying object
    m - MimeType of object if known
    e - encrypted name
    T - tier of storage if known, e.g. "Hot" or "Cool"
    M - Metadata of object in JSON blob format, eg {"key":"value"}

So if you wanted the path, size and modification time, you would use
`--format "pst"`, or maybe `--format "tsp"` to put the path last.

Eg

    $ rclone lsf  --format "tsp" swift:bucket
    2016-06-25 18:55:41;60295;bevajer5jef
    2016-06-25 18:55:43;90613;canole
    2016-06-25 18:55:43;94467;diwogej7
    2018-04-26 08:50:45;0;ferejej3gux/
    2016-06-25 18:55:40;37600;fubuwic

If you specify "h" in the format you will get the MD5 hash by default,
use the `--hash` flag to change which hash you want.  Note that this
can be returned as an empty string if it isn't available on the object
(and for directories), "ERROR" if there was an error reading it from
the object and "UNSUPPORTED" if that object does not support that hash
type.

For example, to emulate the md5sum command you can use

    rclone lsf -R --hash MD5 --format hp --separator "  " --files-only .

Eg

    $ rclone lsf -R --hash MD5 --format hp --separator "  " --files-only swift:bucket
    7908e352297f0f530b84a756f188baa3  bevajer5jef
    cd65ac234e6fea5925974a51cdd865cc  canole
    03b5341b4f234b9d984d03ad076bae91  diwogej7
    8fd37c3810dd660778137ac3a66cc06d  fubuwic
    99713e14a4c4ff553acaf1930fad985b  gixacuh7ku

(Though "rclone md5sum ." is an easier way of typing this.)

By default the separator is ";" this can be changed with the
`--separator` flag.  Note that separators aren't escaped in the path so
putting it last is a good strategy.

Eg

    $ rclone lsf  --separator "," --format "tshp" swift:bucket
    2016-06-25 18:55:41,60295,7908e352297f0f530b84a756f188baa3,bevajer5jef
    2016-06-25 18:55:43,90613,cd65ac234e6fea5925974a51cdd865cc,canole
    2016-06-25 18:55:43,94467,03b5341b4f234b9d984d03ad076bae91,diwogej7
    2018-04-26 08:52:53,0,,ferejej3gux/
    2016-06-25 18:55:40,37600,8fd37c3810dd660778137ac3a66cc06d,fubuwic

You can output in CSV standard format.  This will escape things in "
if they contain ,

Eg

    $ rclone lsf --csv --files-only --format ps remote:path
    test.log,22355
    test.sh,449
    "this file contains a comma, in the file name.txt",6

Note that the `--absolute` parameter is useful for making lists of files
to pass to an rclone copy with the `--files-from-raw` flag.

For example, to find all the files modified within one day and copy
those only (without traversing the whole directory structure):

    rclone lsf --absolute --files-only --max-age 1d /path/to/local > new_files
    rclone copy --files-from-raw new_files /path/to/local remote:path

The default time format is `'2006-01-02 15:04:05'`.
[Other formats](https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants) can be specified with the `--time-format` flag.
Examples:

	rclone lsf remote:path --format pt --time-format 'Jan 2, 2006 at 3:04pm (MST)'
	rclone lsf remote:path --format pt --time-format '2006-01-02 15:04:05.000000000'
	rclone lsf remote:path --format pt --time-format '2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00'
	rclone lsf remote:path --format pt --time-format RFC3339
	rclone lsf remote:path --format pt --time-format DateOnly
	rclone lsf remote:path --format pt --time-format max
`--time-format max` will automatically truncate '`2006-01-02 15:04:05.000000000`'
to the maximum precision supported by the remote.


Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.

There are several related list commands

  * `ls` to list size and path of objects only
  * `lsl` to list modification time, size and path of objects only
  * `lsd` to list directories only
  * `lsf` to list objects and directories in easy to parse format
  * `lsjson` to list objects and directories in JSON format

`ls`,`lsl`,`lsd` are designed to be human-readable.
`lsf` is designed to be human and machine-readable.
`lsjson` is designed to be machine-readable.

Note that `ls` and `lsl` recurse by default - use `--max-depth 1` to stop the recursion.

The other list commands `lsd`,`lsf`,`lsjson` do not recurse by default - use `-R` to make them recurse.

Listing a nonexistent directory will produce an error except for
remotes which can't have empty directories (e.g. s3, swift, or gcs -
the bucket-based remotes).


```
rclone lsf remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --absolute             Put a leading / in front of path names
      --csv                  Output in CSV format
  -d, --dir-slash            Append a slash to directory names (default true)

  -h, --help                 help for lsf
  -R, --recursive            Recurse into the listing
  -s, --separator string     Separator for the items in the format (default ";")
  -t, --time-format string   Specify a custom time format, or 'max' for max precision supported by remote (default: 2006-01-02 15:04:05)
```

# rclone lsjson

List directories and objects in the path in JSON format.

## Synopsis

List directories and objects in the path in JSON format.

The output is an array of Items, where each Item looks like this:

    {
      "Hashes" : {
         "SHA-1" : "f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f",
         "MD5" : "b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184",
         "DropboxHash" : "ecb65bb98f9d905b70458986c39fcbad7715e5f2fcc3b1f07767d7c83e2438cc"
      },
      "ID": "y2djkhiujf83u33",
      "OrigID": "UYOJVTUW00Q1RzTDA",
      "IsBucket" : false,
      "IsDir" : false,
      "MimeType" : "application/octet-stream",
      "ModTime" : "2017-05-31T16:15:57.034468261+01:00",
      "Name" : "file.txt",
      "Encrypted" : "v0qpsdq8anpci8n929v3uu9338",
      "EncryptedPath" : "kja9098349023498/v0qpsdq8anpci8n929v3uu9338",
      "Path" : "full/path/goes/here/file.txt",
      "Size" : 6,
      "Tier" : "hot",
    }

The exact set of properties included depends on the backend:

- The property IsBucket will only be included for bucket-based remotes, and only
  for directories that are buckets. It will always be omitted when value is not true.
- Properties Encrypted and EncryptedPath will only be included for encrypted
  remotes, and (as mentioned below) only if the `--encrypted` option is set.

Different options may also affect which properties are included:

- If `--hash` is not specified, the Hashes property will be omitted. The
  types of hash can be specified with the `--hash-type` parameter (which
  may be repeated). If `--hash-type` is set then it implies `--hash`.
- If `--no-modtime` is specified then ModTime will be blank. This can
  speed things up on remotes where reading the ModTime takes an extra
  request (e.g. s3, swift).
- If `--no-mimetype` is specified then MimeType will be blank. This can
  speed things up on remotes where reading the MimeType takes an extra
  request (e.g. s3, swift).
- If `--encrypted` is not specified the Encrypted and EncryptedPath
  properties will be omitted - even for encrypted remotes.
- If `--metadata` is set then an additional Metadata property will be
  returned. This will have [metadata](https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata) in rclone standard format
  as a JSON object.

The default is to list directories and files/objects, but this can be changed
with the following options:

- If `--dirs-only` is specified then directories will be returned
  only, no files/objects.
- If `--files-only` is specified then files will be returned only,
  no directories.

If `--stat` is set then the the output is not an array of items,
but instead a single JSON blob will be returned about the item pointed to.
This will return an error if the item isn't found, however on bucket based
backends (like s3, gcs, b2, azureblob etc) if the item isn't found it will
return an empty directory, as it isn't possible to tell empty directories
from missing directories there.

The Path field will only show folders below the remote path being listed.
If "remote:path" contains the file "subfolder/file.txt", the Path for "file.txt"
will be "subfolder/file.txt", not "remote:path/subfolder/file.txt".
When used without `--recursive` the Path will always be the same as Name.

The time is in RFC3339 format with up to nanosecond precision.  The
number of decimal digits in the seconds will depend on the precision
that the remote can hold the times, so if times are accurate to the
nearest millisecond (e.g. Google Drive) then 3 digits will always be
shown ("2017-05-31T16:15:57.034+01:00") whereas if the times are
accurate to the nearest second (Dropbox, Box, WebDav, etc.) no digits
will be shown ("2017-05-31T16:15:57+01:00").

The whole output can be processed as a JSON blob, or alternatively it
can be processed line by line as each item is written on individual lines
(except with `--stat`).

Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.

There are several related list commands

  * `ls` to list size and path of objects only
  * `lsl` to list modification time, size and path of objects only
  * `lsd` to list directories only
  * `lsf` to list objects and directories in easy to parse format
  * `lsjson` to list objects and directories in JSON format

`ls`,`lsl`,`lsd` are designed to be human-readable.
`lsf` is designed to be human and machine-readable.
`lsjson` is designed to be machine-readable.

Note that `ls` and `lsl` recurse by default - use `--max-depth 1` to stop the recursion.

The other list commands `lsd`,`lsf`,`lsjson` do not recurse by default - use `-R` to make them recurse.

Listing a nonexistent directory will produce an error except for
remotes which can't have empty directories (e.g. s3, swift, or gcs -
the bucket-based remotes).

# rclone mount

Mount the remote as file system on a mountpoint.

## Synopsis

Rclone mount allows Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows to
mount any of Rclone's cloud storage systems as a file system with FUSE.

First set up your remote using `rclone config`.  Check it works with `rclone ls` etc.

On Linux and macOS, you can run mount in either foreground or background (aka
daemon) mode. Mount runs in foreground mode by default. Use the `--daemon` flag
to force background mode. On Windows you can run mount in foreground only,
the flag is ignored.

In background mode rclone acts as a generic Unix mount program: the main
program starts, spawns background rclone process to setup and maintain the
mount, waits until success or timeout and exits with appropriate code
(killing the child process if it fails).

On Linux/macOS/FreeBSD start the mount like this, where `/path/to/local/mount`
is an **empty** **existing** directory:

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files /path/to/local/mount

On Windows you can start a mount in different ways. See [below](#mounting-modes-on-windows)
for details. If foreground mount is used interactively from a console window,
rclone will serve the mount and occupy the console so another window should be
used to work with the mount until rclone is interrupted e.g. by pressing Ctrl-C.

The following examples will mount to an automatically assigned drive,
to specific drive letter `X:`, to path `C:\path\parent\mount`
(where parent directory or drive must exist, and mount must **not** exist,
and is not supported when [mounting as a network drive](#mounting-modes-on-windows)), and
the last example will mount as network share `\\cloud\remote` and map it to an
automatically assigned drive:

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files *
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files C:\path\parent\mount
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files \\cloud\remote

When the program ends while in foreground mode, either via Ctrl+C or receiving
a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, the mount should be automatically stopped.

When running in background mode the user will have to stop the mount manually:

    # Linux
    fusermount -u /path/to/local/mount
    # OS X
    umount /path/to/local/mount

The umount operation can fail, for example when the mountpoint is busy.
When that happens, it is the user's responsibility to stop the mount manually.

The size of the mounted file system will be set according to information retrieved
from the remote, the same as returned by the [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)
command. Remotes with unlimited storage may report the used size only,
then an additional 1 PiB of free space is assumed. If the remote does not
[support](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) the about feature
at all, then 1 PiB is set as both the total and the free size.

## Installing on Windows

To run rclone mount on Windows, you will need to
download and install [WinFsp](http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/).

[WinFsp](https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp) is an open-source
Windows File System Proxy which makes it easy to write user space file
systems for Windows.  It provides a FUSE emulation layer which rclone
uses combination with [cgofuse](https://github.com/winfsp/cgofuse).
Both of these packages are by Bill Zissimopoulos who was very helpful
during the implementation of rclone mount for Windows.

### Mounting modes on windows

Unlike other operating systems, Microsoft Windows provides a different filesystem
type for network and fixed drives. It optimises access on the assumption fixed
disk drives are fast and reliable, while network drives have relatively high latency
and less reliability. Some settings can also be differentiated between the two types,
for example that Windows Explorer should just display icons and not create preview
thumbnails for image and video files on network drives.

In most cases, rclone will mount the remote as a normal, fixed disk drive by default.
However, you can also choose to mount it as a remote network drive, often described
as a network share. If you mount an rclone remote using the default, fixed drive mode
and experience unexpected program errors, freezes or other issues, consider mounting
as a network drive instead.

When mounting as a fixed disk drive you can either mount to an unused drive letter,
or to a path representing a **nonexistent** subdirectory of an **existing** parent
directory or drive. Using the special value `*` will tell rclone to
automatically assign the next available drive letter, starting with Z: and moving backward.
Examples:

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files *
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files C:\path\parent\mount
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:

Option `--volname` can be used to set a custom volume name for the mounted
file system. The default is to use the remote name and path.

To mount as network drive, you can add option `--network-mode`
to your mount command. Mounting to a directory path is not supported in
this mode, it is a limitation Windows imposes on junctions, so the remote must always
be mounted to a drive letter.

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X: --network-mode

A volume name specified with `--volname` will be used to create the network share path.
A complete UNC path, such as `\\cloud\remote`, optionally with path
`\\cloud\remote\madeup\path`, will be used as is. Any other
string will be used as the share part, after a default prefix `\\server\`.
If no volume name is specified then `\\server\share` will be used.
You must make sure the volume name is unique when you are mounting more than one drive,
or else the mount command will fail. The share name will treated as the volume label for
the mapped drive, shown in Windows Explorer etc, while the complete
`\\server\share` will be reported as the remote UNC path by
`net use` etc, just like a normal network drive mapping.

If you specify a full network share UNC path with `--volname`, this will implicitly
set the `--network-mode` option, so the following two examples have same result:

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X: --network-mode
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X: --volname \\server\share

You may also specify the network share UNC path as the mountpoint itself. Then rclone
will automatically assign a drive letter, same as with `*` and use that as
mountpoint, and instead use the UNC path specified as the volume name, as if it were
specified with the `--volname` option. This will also implicitly set
the `--network-mode` option. This means the following two examples have same result:

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files \\cloud\remote
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files * --volname \\cloud\remote

There is yet another way to enable network mode, and to set the share path,
and that is to pass the "native" libfuse/WinFsp option directly:
`--fuse-flag --VolumePrefix=\server\share`. Note that the path
must be with just a single backslash prefix in this case.


*Note:* In previous versions of rclone this was the only supported method.

See also [Limitations](#limitations) section below.

### Windows filesystem permissions

The FUSE emulation layer on Windows must convert between the POSIX-based
permission model used in FUSE, and the permission model used in Windows,
based on access-control lists (ACL).

The mounted filesystem will normally get three entries in its access-control list (ACL),
representing permissions for the POSIX permission scopes: Owner, group and others.
By default, the owner and group will be taken from the current user, and the built-in
group "Everyone" will be used to represent others. The user/group can be customized
with FUSE options "UserName" and "GroupName",
e.g. `-o UserName=user123 -o GroupName="Authenticated Users"`.
The permissions on each entry will be set according to [options](#options)
`--dir-perms` and `--file-perms`, which takes a value in traditional Unix
[numeric notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions#Numeric_notation).

The default permissions corresponds to `--file-perms 0666 --dir-perms 0777`,
i.e. read and write permissions to everyone. This means you will not be able
to start any programs from the mount. To be able to do that you must add
execute permissions, e.g. `--file-perms 0777 --dir-perms 0777` to add it
to everyone. If the program needs to write files, chances are you will
have to enable [VFS File Caching](#vfs-file-caching) as well (see also
[limitations](#limitations)). Note that the default write permission have
some restrictions for accounts other than the owner, specifically it lacks
the "write extended attributes", as explained next.

The mapping of permissions is not always trivial, and the result you see in
Windows Explorer may not be exactly like you expected. For example, when setting
a value that includes write access for the group or others scope, this will be
mapped to individual permissions "write attributes", "write data" and
"append data", but not "write extended attributes". Windows will then show this
as basic permission "Special" instead of "Write", because "Write" also covers
the "write extended attributes" permission. When setting digit 0 for group or
others, to indicate no permissions, they will still get individual permissions
"read attributes", "read extended attributes" and "read permissions". This is
done for compatibility reasons, e.g. to allow users without additional
permissions to be able to read basic metadata about files like in Unix.

WinFsp 2021 (version 1.9) introduced a new FUSE option "FileSecurity",
that allows the complete specification of file security descriptors using
[SDDL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-string-format).
With this you get detailed control of the resulting permissions, compared
to use of the POSIX permissions described above, and no additional permissions
will be added automatically for compatibility with Unix. Some example use
cases will following.

If you set POSIX permissions for only allowing access to the owner,
using `--file-perms 0600 --dir-perms 0700`, the user group and the built-in
"Everyone" group will still be given some special permissions, as described
above. Some programs may then (incorrectly) interpret this as the file being
accessible by everyone, for example an SSH client may warn about "unprotected
private key file". You can work around this by specifying
`-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FA;;;OW)"`, which sets file all access (FA) to the
owner (OW), and nothing else.

When setting write permissions then, except for the owner, this does not
include the "write extended attributes" permission, as mentioned above.
This may prevent applications from writing to files, giving permission denied
error instead. To set working write permissions for the built-in "Everyone"
group, similar to what it gets by default but with the addition of the
"write extended attributes", you can specify
`-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FRFW;;;WD)"`, which sets file read (FR) and file
write (FW) to everyone (WD). If file execute (FX) is also needed, then change
to `-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FRFWFX;;;WD)"`, or set file all access (FA) to
get full access permissions, including delete, with
`-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FA;;;WD)"`.

### Windows caveats

Drives created as Administrator are not visible to other accounts,
not even an account that was elevated to Administrator with the
User Account Control (UAC) feature. A result of this is that if you mount
to a drive letter from a Command Prompt run as Administrator, and then try
to access the same drive from Windows Explorer (which does not run as
Administrator), you will not be able to see the mounted drive.

If you don't need to access the drive from applications running with
administrative privileges, the easiest way around this is to always
create the mount from a non-elevated command prompt.

To make mapped drives available to the user account that created them
regardless if elevated or not, there is a special Windows setting called
[linked connections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/networking/mapped-drives-not-available-from-elevated-command#detail-to-configure-the-enablelinkedconnections-registry-entry)
that can be enabled.

It is also possible to make a drive mount available to everyone on the system,
by running the process creating it as the built-in SYSTEM account.
There are several ways to do this: One is to use the command-line
utility [PsExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec),
from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite, which has option `-s` to start
processes as the SYSTEM account. Another alternative is to run the mount
command from a Windows Scheduled Task, or a Windows Service, configured
to run as the SYSTEM account. A third alternative is to use the
[WinFsp.Launcher infrastructure](https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp/wiki/WinFsp-Service-Architecture)).
Read more in the [install documentation](https://rclone.org/install/).
Note that when running rclone as another user, it will not use
the configuration file from your profile unless you tell it to
with the [`--config`](https://rclone.org/docs/#config-config-file) option.
Note also that it is now the SYSTEM account that will have the owner
permissions, and other accounts will have permissions according to the
group or others scopes. As mentioned above, these will then not get the
"write extended attributes" permission, and this may prevent writing to
files. You can work around this with the FileSecurity option, see
example above.

Note that mapping to a directory path, instead of a drive letter,
does not suffer from the same limitations.

## Mounting on macOS

Mounting on macOS can be done either via [built-in NFS server](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_nfs/), [macFUSE](https://osxfuse.github.io/) 
(also known as osxfuse) or [FUSE-T](https://www.fuse-t.org/). macFUSE is a traditional
FUSE driver utilizing a macOS kernel extension (kext). FUSE-T is an alternative FUSE system
which "mounts" via an NFSv4 local server.

#### Unicode Normalization

It is highly recommended to keep the default of `--no-unicode-normalization=false`
for all `mount` and `serve` commands on macOS. For details, see [vfs-case-sensitivity](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#vfs-case-sensitivity).

### NFS mount

This method spins up an NFS server using [serve nfs](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_nfs/) command and mounts
it to the specified mountpoint. If you run this in background mode using |--daemon|, you will need to
send SIGTERM signal to the rclone process using |kill| command to stop the mount.

Note that `--nfs-cache-handle-limit` controls the maximum number of cached file handles stored by the `nfsmount` caching handler.
This should not be set too low or you may experience errors when trying to access files. The default is 1000000,
but consider lowering this limit if the server's system resource usage causes problems.

### macFUSE Notes

If installing macFUSE using [dmg packages](https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/releases) from
the website, rclone will locate the macFUSE libraries without any further intervention.
If however, macFUSE is installed using the [macports](https://www.macports.org/) package manager,
the following addition steps are required.

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib
    cd /usr/local/lib
    sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/libfuse.2.dylib

### FUSE-T Limitations, Caveats, and Notes

There are some limitations, caveats, and notes about how it works. These are current as 
of FUSE-T version 1.0.14.

#### ModTime update on read

As per the [FUSE-T wiki](https://github.com/macos-fuse-t/fuse-t/wiki#caveats):

> File access and modification times cannot be set separately as it seems to be an 
> issue with the NFS client which always modifies both. Can be reproduced with 
> 'touch -m' and 'touch -a' commands

This means that viewing files with various tools, notably macOS Finder, will cause rlcone
to update the modification time of the file. This may make rclone upload a full new copy
of the file.
    
#### Read Only mounts

When mounting with `--read-only`, attempts to write to files will fail *silently* as
opposed to with a clear warning as in macFUSE.

## Limitations

Without the use of `--vfs-cache-mode` this can only write files
sequentially, it can only seek when reading.  This means that many
applications won't work with their files on an rclone mount without
`--vfs-cache-mode writes` or `--vfs-cache-mode full`.
See the [VFS File Caching](#vfs-file-caching) section for more info.
When using NFS mount on macOS, if you don't specify |--vfs-cache-mode|
the mount point will be read-only.

The bucket-based remotes (e.g. Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2)
do not support the concept of empty directories, so empty
directories will have a tendency to disappear once they fall out of
the directory cache.

When `rclone mount` is invoked on Unix with `--daemon` flag, the main rclone
program will wait for the background mount to become ready or until the timeout
specified by the `--daemon-wait` flag. On Linux it can check mount status using
ProcFS so the flag in fact sets **maximum** time to wait, while the real wait
can be less. On macOS / BSD the time to wait is constant and the check is
performed only at the end. We advise you to set wait time on macOS reasonably.

Only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OS X and Windows at the moment.

## rclone mount vs rclone sync/copy

File systems expect things to be 100% reliable, whereas cloud storage
systems are a long way from 100% reliable. The rclone sync/copy
commands cope with this with lots of retries.  However rclone mount
can't use retries in the same way without making local copies of the
uploads. Look at the [VFS File Caching](#vfs-file-caching)
for solutions to make mount more reliable.

## Attribute caching

You can use the flag `--attr-timeout` to set the time the kernel caches
the attributes (size, modification time, etc.) for directory entries.

The default is `1s` which caches files just long enough to avoid
too many callbacks to rclone from the kernel.

In theory 0s should be the correct value for filesystems which can
change outside the control of the kernel. However this causes quite a
few problems such as
[rclone using too much memory](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2157),
[rclone not serving files to samba](https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-1-39-vs-1-40-mount-issue/5112)
and [excessive time listing directories](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2095#issuecomment-371141147).

The kernel can cache the info about a file for the time given by
`--attr-timeout`. You may see corruption if the remote file changes
length during this window.  It will show up as either a truncated file
or a file with garbage on the end.  With `--attr-timeout 1s` this is
very unlikely but not impossible.  The higher you set `--attr-timeout`
the more likely it is.  The default setting of "1s" is the lowest
setting which mitigates the problems above.

If you set it higher (`10s` or `1m` say) then the kernel will call
back to rclone less often making it more efficient, however there is
more chance of the corruption issue above.

If files don't change on the remote outside of the control of rclone
then there is no chance of corruption.

This is the same as setting the attr_timeout option in mount.fuse.

## Filters

Note that all the rclone filters can be used to select a subset of the
files to be visible in the mount.

## systemd

When running rclone mount as a systemd service, it is possible
to use Type=notify. In this case the service will enter the started state
after the mountpoint has been successfully set up.
Units having the rclone mount service specified as a requirement
will see all files and folders immediately in this mode.

Note that systemd runs mount units without any environment variables including
`PATH` or `HOME`. This means that tilde (`~`) expansion will not work
and you should provide `--config` and `--cache-dir` explicitly as absolute
paths via rclone arguments.
Since mounting requires the `fusermount` program, rclone will use the fallback
PATH of `/bin:/usr/bin` in this scenario. Please ensure that `fusermount`
is present on this PATH.

## Rclone as Unix mount helper

The core Unix program `/bin/mount` normally takes the `-t FSTYPE` argument
then runs the `/sbin/mount.FSTYPE` helper program passing it mount options
as `-o key=val,...` or `--opt=...`. Automount (classic or systemd) behaves
in a similar way.

rclone by default expects GNU-style flags `--key val`. To run it as a mount
helper you should symlink rclone binary to `/sbin/mount.rclone` and optionally
`/usr/bin/rclonefs`, e.g. `ln -s /usr/bin/rclone /sbin/mount.rclone`.
rclone will detect it and translate command-line arguments appropriately.

Now you can run classic mounts like this:
```
mount sftp1:subdir /mnt/data -t rclone -o vfs_cache_mode=writes,sftp_key_file=/path/to/pem
```

or create systemd mount units:
```
# /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.mount
[Unit]
Description=Mount for /mnt/data
[Mount]
Type=rclone
What=sftp1:subdir
Where=/mnt/data
Options=rw,_netdev,allow_other,args2env,vfs-cache-mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache-dir=/var/rclone
```

optionally accompanied by systemd automount unit
```
# /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.automount
[Unit]
Description=AutoMount for /mnt/data
[Automount]
Where=/mnt/data
TimeoutIdleSec=600
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

or add in `/etc/fstab` a line like
```
sftp1:subdir /mnt/data rclone rw,noauto,nofail,_netdev,x-systemd.automount,args2env,vfs_cache_mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache_dir=/var/cache/rclone 0 0
```

or use classic Automountd.
Remember to provide explicit `config=...,cache-dir=...` as a workaround for
mount units being run without `HOME`.

Rclone in the mount helper mode will split `-o` argument(s) by comma, replace `_`
by `-` and prepend `--` to get the command-line flags. Options containing commas
or spaces can be wrapped in single or double quotes. Any inner quotes inside outer
quotes of the same type should be doubled.

Mount option syntax includes a few extra options treated specially:

- `env.NAME=VALUE` will set an environment variable for the mount process.
  This helps with Automountd and Systemd.mount which don't allow setting
  custom environment for mount helpers.
  Typically you will use `env.HTTPS_PROXY=proxy.host:3128` or `env.HOME=/root`
- `command=cmount` can be used to run `cmount` or any other rclone command
  rather than the default `mount`.
- `args2env` will pass mount options to the mount helper running in background
  via environment variables instead of command line arguments. This allows to
  hide secrets from such commands as `ps` or `pgrep`.
- `vv...` will be transformed into appropriate `--verbose=N`
- standard mount options like `x-systemd.automount`, `_netdev`, `nosuid` and alike
  are intended only for Automountd and ignored by rclone.

## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` note
that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly
because it is only checked every `--vfs-cache-poll-interval`. Secondly
because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When
`--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` is exceeded,
rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache
first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the
longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant
files are likely to remain cached.

The `--vfs-cache-max-age` will evict files from the cache
after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of
1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed
for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0
and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with
standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

### Fingerprinting

Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file
copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made
from:

- size
- modification time
- hash

where available on an object.

On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take
an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).

For example `hash` is slow with the `local` and `sftp` backends as
they have to read the entire file and hash it, and `modtime` is slow
with the `s3`, `swift`, `ftp` and `qinqstor` backends because they
need to do an extra API call to fetch it.

If you use the `--vfs-fast-fingerprint` flag then rclone will not
include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the
fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the
opening time of cached files.

If you are running a vfs cache over `local`, `s3` or `swift` backends
then using this flag is recommended.

Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of
the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to
be downloaded again.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
    --vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once

The chunking behaves differently depending on the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` parameter.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` == 0

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

The chunks will not be buffered in memory.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` > 0

Rclone reads `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` chunks of size
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` concurrently. The size for each read will stay
constant.

This improves performance performance massively on high latency links
or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.

Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` and `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` as these will
depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.

For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to
start might be `--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16` and
`--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M`. In testing with AWS S3 the performance
scaled roughly as the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` setting.

Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on
the latency they may need more `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` in order to
get the throughput.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Only allow read-only access.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from the cache (the related global flag `--checkers` has no effect on the VFS).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` VFS flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by the underlying remote.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

The `--no-unicode-normalization` flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is
performed for filenames that differ but are [canonically
equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence) with respect to
unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS,
which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is
therefore highly recommended to keep the default of `false` on macOS, to avoid
encoding compatibility issues.

In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate
filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the `--vfs-block-norm-dupes`
flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as
rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a
directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not
needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a
remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd
situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount,
and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will
actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. `--vfs-block-
norm-dupes` prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the
duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in `rclone
sync`.

## VFS Disk Options

This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system.
It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.

    --vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

# rclone moveto

Move file or directory from source to dest.

## Synopsis

If source:path is a file or directory then it moves it to a file or
directory named dest:path.

This can be used to rename files or upload single files to other than
their existing name.  If the source is a directory then it acts exactly
like the [move](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/) command.

So

    rclone moveto src dst

where src and dst are rclone paths, either remote:path or
/path/to/local or C:\windows\path\if\on\windows.

This will:

    if src is file
        move it to dst, overwriting an existing file if it exists
    if src is directory
        move it to dst, overwriting existing files if they exist
        see move command for full details

This doesn't transfer files that are identical on src and dst, testing
by size and modification time or MD5SUM.  src will be deleted on
successful transfer.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.

**Note**: Use the `-P`/`--progress` flag to view real-time transfer statistics.

# rclone ncdu

Explore a remote with a text based user interface.

## Synopsis

This displays a text based user interface allowing the navigation of a
remote. It is most useful for answering the question - "What is using
all my disk space?".



To make the user interface it first scans the entire remote given and
builds an in memory representation.  rclone ncdu can be used during
this scanning phase and you will see it building up the directory
structure as it goes along.

You can interact with the user interface using key presses,
press '?' to toggle the help on and off. The supported keys are:

     ↑,↓ or k,j to Move
     →,l to enter
     ←,h to return
     g toggle graph
     c toggle counts
     a toggle average size in directory
     m toggle modified time
     u toggle human-readable format
     n,s,C,A,M sort by name,size,count,asize,mtime
     d delete file/directory
     v select file/directory
     V enter visual select mode
     D delete selected files/directories
     y copy current path to clipboard
     Y display current path
     ^L refresh screen (fix screen corruption)
     r recalculate file sizes
     ? to toggle help on and off
     ESC to close the menu box
     q/^c to quit

Listed files/directories may be prefixed by a one-character flag,
some of them combined with a description in brackets at end of line.
These flags have the following meaning:

    e means this is an empty directory, i.e. contains no files (but
      may contain empty subdirectories)
    ~ means this is a directory where some of the files (possibly in
      subdirectories) have unknown size, and therefore the directory
      size may be underestimated (and average size inaccurate, as it
      is average of the files with known sizes).
    . means an error occurred while reading a subdirectory, and
      therefore the directory size may be underestimated (and average
      size inaccurate)
    ! means an error occurred while reading this directory

This an homage to the [ncdu tool](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) but for
rclone remotes.  It is missing lots of features at the moment
but is useful as it stands. Unlike ncdu it does not show excluded files.

Note that it might take some time to delete big files/directories. The
UI won't respond in the meantime since the deletion is done synchronously.

For a non-interactive listing of the remote, see the
[tree](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_tree/) command. To just get the total size of
the remote you can also use the [size](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_size/) command.


```
rclone ncdu remote:path [flags]
```

```
  -h, --help   help for ncdu

# rclone nfsmount

Mount the remote as file system on a mountpoint.

## Synopsis

Rclone nfsmount allows Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows to
mount any of Rclone's cloud storage systems as a file system with FUSE.

First set up your remote using `rclone config`.  Check it works with `rclone ls` etc.

On Linux and macOS, you can run mount in either foreground or background (aka
daemon) mode. Mount runs in foreground mode by default. Use the `--daemon` flag
to force background mode. On Windows you can run mount in foreground only,
the flag is ignored.

In background mode rclone acts as a generic Unix mount program: the main
program starts, spawns background rclone process to setup and maintain the
mount, waits until success or timeout and exits with appropriate code
(killing the child process if it fails).

On Linux/macOS/FreeBSD start the mount like this, where `/path/to/local/mount`
is an **empty** **existing** directory:

    rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files /path/to/local/mount

On Windows you can start a mount in different ways. See [below](#mounting-modes-on-windows)
for details. If foreground mount is used interactively from a console window,
rclone will serve the mount and occupy the console so another window should be
used to work with the mount until rclone is interrupted e.g. by pressing Ctrl-C.

The following examples will mount to an automatically assigned drive,
to specific drive letter `X:`, to path `C:\path\parent\mount`
(where parent directory or drive must exist, and mount must **not** exist,
and is not supported when [mounting as a network drive](#mounting-modes-on-windows)), and
the last example will mount as network share `\\cloud\remote` and map it to an
automatically assigned drive:

    rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files *
    rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files X:
    rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files C:\path\parent\mount
    rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files \\cloud\remote

When the program ends while in foreground mode, either via Ctrl+C or receiving
a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, the mount should be automatically stopped.

When running in background mode the user will have to stop the mount manually:

    # Linux
    fusermount -u /path/to/local/mount
    # OS X
    umount /path/to/local/mount

The umount operation can fail, for example when the mountpoint is busy.
When that happens, it is the user's responsibility to stop the mount manually.

The size of the mounted file system will be set according to information retrieved
from the remote, the same as returned by the [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)
command. Remotes with unlimited storage may report the used size only,
then an additional 1 PiB of free space is assumed. If the remote does not
[support](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) the about feature
at all, then 1 PiB is set as both the total and the free size.

## Installing on Windows

To run rclone nfsmount on Windows, you will need to
download and install [WinFsp](http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/).

[WinFsp](https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp) is an open-source
Windows File System Proxy which makes it easy to write user space file
systems for Windows.  It provides a FUSE emulation layer which rclone
uses combination with [cgofuse](https://github.com/winfsp/cgofuse).
Both of these packages are by Bill Zissimopoulos who was very helpful
during the implementation of rclone nfsmount for Windows.

### Mounting modes on windows

Unlike other operating systems, Microsoft Windows provides a different filesystem
type for network and fixed drives. It optimises access on the assumption fixed
disk drives are fast and reliable, while network drives have relatively high latency
and less reliability. Some settings can also be differentiated between the two types,
for example that Windows Explorer should just display icons and not create preview
thumbnails for image and video files on network drives.

In most cases, rclone will mount the remote as a normal, fixed disk drive by default.
However, you can also choose to mount it as a remote network drive, often described
as a network share. If you mount an rclone remote using the default, fixed drive mode
and experience unexpected program errors, freezes or other issues, consider mounting
as a network drive instead.

When mounting as a fixed disk drive you can either mount to an unused drive letter,
or to a path representing a **nonexistent** subdirectory of an **existing** parent
directory or drive. Using the special value `*` will tell rclone to
automatically assign the next available drive letter, starting with Z: and moving backward.
Examples:

    rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files *
    rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files X:
    rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files C:\path\parent\mount
    rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files X:

Option `--volname` can be used to set a custom volume name for the mounted
file system. The default is to use the remote name and path.

To mount as network drive, you can add option `--network-mode`
to your nfsmount command. Mounting to a directory path is not supported in
this mode, it is a limitation Windows imposes on junctions, so the remote must always
be mounted to a drive letter.

    rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files X: --network-mode

A volume name specified with `--volname` will be used to create the network share path.
A complete UNC path, such as `\\cloud\remote`, optionally with path
`\\cloud\remote\madeup\path`, will be used as is. Any other
string will be used as the share part, after a default prefix `\\server\`.
If no volume name is specified then `\\server\share` will be used.
You must make sure the volume name is unique when you are mounting more than one drive,
or else the mount command will fail. The share name will treated as the volume label for
the mapped drive, shown in Windows Explorer etc, while the complete
`\\server\share` will be reported as the remote UNC path by
`net use` etc, just like a normal network drive mapping.

If you specify a full network share UNC path with `--volname`, this will implicitly
set the `--network-mode` option, so the following two examples have same result:

    rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files X: --network-mode
    rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files X: --volname \\server\share

You may also specify the network share UNC path as the mountpoint itself. Then rclone
will automatically assign a drive letter, same as with `*` and use that as
mountpoint, and instead use the UNC path specified as the volume name, as if it were
specified with the `--volname` option. This will also implicitly set
the `--network-mode` option. This means the following two examples have same result:

    rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files \\cloud\remote
    rclone nfsmount remote:path/to/files * --volname \\cloud\remote

There is yet another way to enable network mode, and to set the share path,
and that is to pass the "native" libfuse/WinFsp option directly:
`--fuse-flag --VolumePrefix=\server\share`. Note that the path
must be with just a single backslash prefix in this case.


*Note:* In previous versions of rclone this was the only supported method.

See also [Limitations](#limitations) section below.

### Windows filesystem permissions

The FUSE emulation layer on Windows must convert between the POSIX-based
permission model used in FUSE, and the permission model used in Windows,
based on access-control lists (ACL).

The mounted filesystem will normally get three entries in its access-control list (ACL),
representing permissions for the POSIX permission scopes: Owner, group and others.
By default, the owner and group will be taken from the current user, and the built-in
group "Everyone" will be used to represent others. The user/group can be customized
with FUSE options "UserName" and "GroupName",
e.g. `-o UserName=user123 -o GroupName="Authenticated Users"`.
The permissions on each entry will be set according to [options](#options)
`--dir-perms` and `--file-perms`, which takes a value in traditional Unix
[numeric notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions#Numeric_notation).

The default permissions corresponds to `--file-perms 0666 --dir-perms 0777`,
i.e. read and write permissions to everyone. This means you will not be able
to start any programs from the mount. To be able to do that you must add
execute permissions, e.g. `--file-perms 0777 --dir-perms 0777` to add it
to everyone. If the program needs to write files, chances are you will
have to enable [VFS File Caching](#vfs-file-caching) as well (see also
[limitations](#limitations)). Note that the default write permission have
some restrictions for accounts other than the owner, specifically it lacks
the "write extended attributes", as explained next.

The mapping of permissions is not always trivial, and the result you see in
Windows Explorer may not be exactly like you expected. For example, when setting
a value that includes write access for the group or others scope, this will be
mapped to individual permissions "write attributes", "write data" and
"append data", but not "write extended attributes". Windows will then show this
as basic permission "Special" instead of "Write", because "Write" also covers
the "write extended attributes" permission. When setting digit 0 for group or
others, to indicate no permissions, they will still get individual permissions
"read attributes", "read extended attributes" and "read permissions". This is
done for compatibility reasons, e.g. to allow users without additional
permissions to be able to read basic metadata about files like in Unix.

WinFsp 2021 (version 1.9) introduced a new FUSE option "FileSecurity",
that allows the complete specification of file security descriptors using
[SDDL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-string-format).
With this you get detailed control of the resulting permissions, compared
to use of the POSIX permissions described above, and no additional permissions
will be added automatically for compatibility with Unix. Some example use
cases will following.

If you set POSIX permissions for only allowing access to the owner,
using `--file-perms 0600 --dir-perms 0700`, the user group and the built-in
"Everyone" group will still be given some special permissions, as described
above. Some programs may then (incorrectly) interpret this as the file being
accessible by everyone, for example an SSH client may warn about "unprotected
private key file". You can work around this by specifying
`-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FA;;;OW)"`, which sets file all access (FA) to the
owner (OW), and nothing else.

When setting write permissions then, except for the owner, this does not
include the "write extended attributes" permission, as mentioned above.
This may prevent applications from writing to files, giving permission denied
error instead. To set working write permissions for the built-in "Everyone"
group, similar to what it gets by default but with the addition of the
"write extended attributes", you can specify
`-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FRFW;;;WD)"`, which sets file read (FR) and file
write (FW) to everyone (WD). If file execute (FX) is also needed, then change
to `-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FRFWFX;;;WD)"`, or set file all access (FA) to
get full access permissions, including delete, with
`-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FA;;;WD)"`.

### Windows caveats

Drives created as Administrator are not visible to other accounts,
not even an account that was elevated to Administrator with the
User Account Control (UAC) feature. A result of this is that if you mount
to a drive letter from a Command Prompt run as Administrator, and then try
to access the same drive from Windows Explorer (which does not run as
Administrator), you will not be able to see the mounted drive.

If you don't need to access the drive from applications running with
administrative privileges, the easiest way around this is to always
create the mount from a non-elevated command prompt.

To make mapped drives available to the user account that created them
regardless if elevated or not, there is a special Windows setting called
[linked connections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/networking/mapped-drives-not-available-from-elevated-command#detail-to-configure-the-enablelinkedconnections-registry-entry)
that can be enabled.

It is also possible to make a drive mount available to everyone on the system,
by running the process creating it as the built-in SYSTEM account.
There are several ways to do this: One is to use the command-line
utility [PsExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec),
from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite, which has option `-s` to start
processes as the SYSTEM account. Another alternative is to run the mount
command from a Windows Scheduled Task, or a Windows Service, configured
to run as the SYSTEM account. A third alternative is to use the
[WinFsp.Launcher infrastructure](https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp/wiki/WinFsp-Service-Architecture)).
Read more in the [install documentation](https://rclone.org/install/).
Note that when running rclone as another user, it will not use
the configuration file from your profile unless you tell it to
with the [`--config`](https://rclone.org/docs/#config-config-file) option.
Note also that it is now the SYSTEM account that will have the owner
permissions, and other accounts will have permissions according to the
group or others scopes. As mentioned above, these will then not get the
"write extended attributes" permission, and this may prevent writing to
files. You can work around this with the FileSecurity option, see
example above.

Note that mapping to a directory path, instead of a drive letter,
does not suffer from the same limitations.

## Mounting on macOS

Mounting on macOS can be done either via [built-in NFS server](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_nfs/), [macFUSE](https://osxfuse.github.io/) 
(also known as osxfuse) or [FUSE-T](https://www.fuse-t.org/). macFUSE is a traditional
FUSE driver utilizing a macOS kernel extension (kext). FUSE-T is an alternative FUSE system
which "mounts" via an NFSv4 local server.

#### Unicode Normalization

It is highly recommended to keep the default of `--no-unicode-normalization=false`
for all `mount` and `serve` commands on macOS. For details, see [vfs-case-sensitivity](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#vfs-case-sensitivity).

### NFS mount

This method spins up an NFS server using [serve nfs](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_nfs/) command and mounts
it to the specified mountpoint. If you run this in background mode using |--daemon|, you will need to
send SIGTERM signal to the rclone process using |kill| command to stop the mount.

Note that `--nfs-cache-handle-limit` controls the maximum number of cached file handles stored by the `nfsmount` caching handler.
This should not be set too low or you may experience errors when trying to access files. The default is 1000000,
but consider lowering this limit if the server's system resource usage causes problems.

### macFUSE Notes

If installing macFUSE using [dmg packages](https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/releases) from
the website, rclone will locate the macFUSE libraries without any further intervention.
If however, macFUSE is installed using the [macports](https://www.macports.org/) package manager,
the following addition steps are required.

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib
    cd /usr/local/lib
    sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/libfuse.2.dylib

### FUSE-T Limitations, Caveats, and Notes

There are some limitations, caveats, and notes about how it works. These are current as 
of FUSE-T version 1.0.14.

#### ModTime update on read

As per the [FUSE-T wiki](https://github.com/macos-fuse-t/fuse-t/wiki#caveats):

> File access and modification times cannot be set separately as it seems to be an 
> issue with the NFS client which always modifies both. Can be reproduced with 
> 'touch -m' and 'touch -a' commands

This means that viewing files with various tools, notably macOS Finder, will cause rlcone
to update the modification time of the file. This may make rclone upload a full new copy
of the file.
    
#### Read Only mounts

When mounting with `--read-only`, attempts to write to files will fail *silently* as
opposed to with a clear warning as in macFUSE.

## Limitations

Without the use of `--vfs-cache-mode` this can only write files
sequentially, it can only seek when reading.  This means that many
applications won't work with their files on an rclone mount without
`--vfs-cache-mode writes` or `--vfs-cache-mode full`.
See the [VFS File Caching](#vfs-file-caching) section for more info.
When using NFS mount on macOS, if you don't specify |--vfs-cache-mode|
the mount point will be read-only.

The bucket-based remotes (e.g. Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2)
do not support the concept of empty directories, so empty
directories will have a tendency to disappear once they fall out of
the directory cache.

When `rclone mount` is invoked on Unix with `--daemon` flag, the main rclone
program will wait for the background mount to become ready or until the timeout
specified by the `--daemon-wait` flag. On Linux it can check mount status using
ProcFS so the flag in fact sets **maximum** time to wait, while the real wait
can be less. On macOS / BSD the time to wait is constant and the check is
performed only at the end. We advise you to set wait time on macOS reasonably.

Only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OS X and Windows at the moment.

## rclone nfsmount vs rclone sync/copy

File systems expect things to be 100% reliable, whereas cloud storage
systems are a long way from 100% reliable. The rclone sync/copy
commands cope with this with lots of retries.  However rclone nfsmount
can't use retries in the same way without making local copies of the
uploads. Look at the [VFS File Caching](#vfs-file-caching)
for solutions to make nfsmount more reliable.

## Attribute caching

You can use the flag `--attr-timeout` to set the time the kernel caches
the attributes (size, modification time, etc.) for directory entries.

The default is `1s` which caches files just long enough to avoid
too many callbacks to rclone from the kernel.

In theory 0s should be the correct value for filesystems which can
change outside the control of the kernel. However this causes quite a
few problems such as
[rclone using too much memory](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2157),
[rclone not serving files to samba](https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-1-39-vs-1-40-mount-issue/5112)
and [excessive time listing directories](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2095#issuecomment-371141147).

The kernel can cache the info about a file for the time given by
`--attr-timeout`. You may see corruption if the remote file changes
length during this window.  It will show up as either a truncated file
or a file with garbage on the end.  With `--attr-timeout 1s` this is
very unlikely but not impossible.  The higher you set `--attr-timeout`
the more likely it is.  The default setting of "1s" is the lowest
setting which mitigates the problems above.

If you set it higher (`10s` or `1m` say) then the kernel will call
back to rclone less often making it more efficient, however there is
more chance of the corruption issue above.

If files don't change on the remote outside of the control of rclone
then there is no chance of corruption.

This is the same as setting the attr_timeout option in mount.fuse.

## Filters

Note that all the rclone filters can be used to select a subset of the
files to be visible in the mount.

## systemd

When running rclone nfsmount as a systemd service, it is possible
to use Type=notify. In this case the service will enter the started state
after the mountpoint has been successfully set up.
Units having the rclone nfsmount service specified as a requirement
will see all files and folders immediately in this mode.

Note that systemd runs mount units without any environment variables including
`PATH` or `HOME`. This means that tilde (`~`) expansion will not work
and you should provide `--config` and `--cache-dir` explicitly as absolute
paths via rclone arguments.
Since mounting requires the `fusermount` program, rclone will use the fallback
PATH of `/bin:/usr/bin` in this scenario. Please ensure that `fusermount`
is present on this PATH.

## Rclone as Unix mount helper

The core Unix program `/bin/mount` normally takes the `-t FSTYPE` argument
then runs the `/sbin/mount.FSTYPE` helper program passing it mount options
as `-o key=val,...` or `--opt=...`. Automount (classic or systemd) behaves
in a similar way.

rclone by default expects GNU-style flags `--key val`. To run it as a mount
helper you should symlink rclone binary to `/sbin/mount.rclone` and optionally
`/usr/bin/rclonefs`, e.g. `ln -s /usr/bin/rclone /sbin/mount.rclone`.
rclone will detect it and translate command-line arguments appropriately.

Now you can run classic mounts like this:
```
mount sftp1:subdir /mnt/data -t rclone -o vfs_cache_mode=writes,sftp_key_file=/path/to/pem
```

or create systemd mount units:
```
# /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.mount
[Unit]
Description=Mount for /mnt/data
[Mount]
Type=rclone
What=sftp1:subdir
Where=/mnt/data
Options=rw,_netdev,allow_other,args2env,vfs-cache-mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache-dir=/var/rclone
```

optionally accompanied by systemd automount unit
```
# /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.automount
[Unit]
Description=AutoMount for /mnt/data
[Automount]
Where=/mnt/data
TimeoutIdleSec=600
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

or add in `/etc/fstab` a line like
```
sftp1:subdir /mnt/data rclone rw,noauto,nofail,_netdev,x-systemd.automount,args2env,vfs_cache_mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache_dir=/var/cache/rclone 0 0
```

or use classic Automountd.
Remember to provide explicit `config=...,cache-dir=...` as a workaround for
mount units being run without `HOME`.

Rclone in the mount helper mode will split `-o` argument(s) by comma, replace `_`
by `-` and prepend `--` to get the command-line flags. Options containing commas
or spaces can be wrapped in single or double quotes. Any inner quotes inside outer
quotes of the same type should be doubled.

Mount option syntax includes a few extra options treated specially:

- `env.NAME=VALUE` will set an environment variable for the mount process.
  This helps with Automountd and Systemd.mount which don't allow setting
  custom environment for mount helpers.
  Typically you will use `env.HTTPS_PROXY=proxy.host:3128` or `env.HOME=/root`
- `command=cmount` can be used to run `cmount` or any other rclone command
  rather than the default `mount`.
- `args2env` will pass mount options to the mount helper running in background
  via environment variables instead of command line arguments. This allows to
  hide secrets from such commands as `ps` or `pgrep`.
- `vv...` will be transformed into appropriate `--verbose=N`
- standard mount options like `x-systemd.automount`, `_netdev`, `nosuid` and alike
  are intended only for Automountd and ignored by rclone.

## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` note
that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly
because it is only checked every `--vfs-cache-poll-interval`. Secondly
because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When
`--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` is exceeded,
rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache
first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the
longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant
files are likely to remain cached.

The `--vfs-cache-max-age` will evict files from the cache
after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of
1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed
for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0
and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with
standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

### Fingerprinting

Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file
copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made
from:

- size
- modification time
- hash

where available on an object.

On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take
an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).

For example `hash` is slow with the `local` and `sftp` backends as
they have to read the entire file and hash it, and `modtime` is slow
with the `s3`, `swift`, `ftp` and `qinqstor` backends because they
need to do an extra API call to fetch it.

If you use the `--vfs-fast-fingerprint` flag then rclone will not
include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the
fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the
opening time of cached files.

If you are running a vfs cache over `local`, `s3` or `swift` backends
then using this flag is recommended.

Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of
the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to
be downloaded again.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
    --vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once

The chunking behaves differently depending on the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` parameter.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` == 0

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

The chunks will not be buffered in memory.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` > 0

Rclone reads `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` chunks of size
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` concurrently. The size for each read will stay
constant.

This improves performance performance massively on high latency links
or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.

Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` and `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` as these will
depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.

For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to
start might be `--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16` and
`--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M`. In testing with AWS S3 the performance
scaled roughly as the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` setting.

Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on
the latency they may need more `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` in order to
get the throughput.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Only allow read-only access.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from the cache (the related global flag `--checkers` has no effect on the VFS).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` VFS flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by the underlying remote.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

The `--no-unicode-normalization` flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is
performed for filenames that differ but are [canonically
equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence) with respect to
unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS,
which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is
therefore highly recommended to keep the default of `false` on macOS, to avoid
encoding compatibility issues.

In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate
filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the `--vfs-block-norm-dupes`
flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as
rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a
directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not
needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a
remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd
situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount,
and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will
actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. `--vfs-block-
norm-dupes` prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the
duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in `rclone
sync`.

## VFS Disk Options

This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system.
It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.

    --vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

# rclone obscure

Obscure password for use in the rclone config file.

## Synopsis

In the rclone config file, human-readable passwords are
obscured. Obscuring them is done by encrypting them and writing them
out in base64. This is **not** a secure way of encrypting these
passwords as rclone can decrypt them - it is to prevent "eyedropping"
- namely someone seeing a password in the rclone config file by
accident.

Many equally important things (like access tokens) are not obscured in
the config file. However it is very hard to shoulder surf a 64
character hex token.

This command can also accept a password through STDIN instead of an
argument by passing a hyphen as an argument. This will use the first
line of STDIN as the password not including the trailing newline.

    echo "secretpassword" | rclone obscure -

If there is no data on STDIN to read, rclone obscure will default to
obfuscating the hyphen itself.

If you want to encrypt the config file then please use config file
encryption - see [rclone config](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config/) for more
info.

```
rclone obscure password [flags]
```

## Options

  -h, --help   help for obscure
```

# rclone rc

Run a command against a running rclone.

## Synopsis

This runs a command against a running rclone.  Use the `--url` flag to
specify an non default URL to connect on.  This can be either a
":port" which is taken to mean "http://localhost:port" or a
"host:port" which is taken to mean "http://host:port"

A username and password can be passed in with `--user` and `--pass`.

Note that `--rc-addr`, `--rc-user`, `--rc-pass` will be read also for
`--url`, `--user`, `--pass`.

The `--unix-socket` flag can be used to connect over a unix socket like this

    # start server on /tmp/my.socket
    rclone rcd --rc-addr unix:///tmp/my.socket
    # Connect to it
    rclone rc --unix-socket /tmp/my.socket core/stats

Arguments should be passed in as parameter=value.

The result will be returned as a JSON object by default.

The `--json` parameter can be used to pass in a JSON blob as an input
instead of key=value arguments.  This is the only way of passing in
more complicated values.

The `-o`/`--opt` option can be used to set a key "opt" with key, value
options in the form `-o key=value` or `-o key`. It can be repeated as
many times as required. This is useful for rc commands which take the
"opt" parameter which by convention is a dictionary of strings.

    -o key=value -o key2

Will place this in the "opt" value

    {"key":"value", "key2","")


The `-a`/`--arg` option can be used to set strings in the "arg" value. It
can be repeated as many times as required. This is useful for rc
commands which take the "arg" parameter which by convention is a list
of strings.

    -a value -a value2

Will place this in the "arg" value

    ["value", "value2"]

Use `--loopback` to connect to the rclone instance running `rclone rc`.
This is very useful for testing commands without having to run an
rclone rc server, e.g.:

    rclone rc --loopback operations/about fs=/

Use `rclone rc` to see a list of all possible commands.

```
rclone rc commands parameter [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -a, --arg stringArray      Argument placed in the "arg" array
  -h, --help                 help for rc
      --json string          Input JSON - use instead of key=value args
      --loopback             If set connect to this rclone instance not via HTTP
      --no-output            If set, don't output the JSON result
  -o, --opt stringArray      Option in the form name=value or name placed in the "opt" array
      --pass string          Password to use to connect to rclone remote control
      --unix-socket string   Path to a unix domain socket to dial to, instead of opening a TCP connection directly
      --url string           URL to connect to rclone remote control (default "http://localhost:5572/")
      --user string          Username to use to rclone remote control
```

# rclone rcat

Copies standard input to file on remote.

## Synopsis

Reads from standard input (stdin) and copies it to a single remote file.

    echo "hello world" | rclone rcat remote:path/to/file
    ffmpeg - | rclone rcat remote:path/to/file

If the remote file already exists, it will be overwritten.

rcat will try to upload small files in a single request, which is
usually more efficient than the streaming/chunked upload endpoints,
which use multiple requests. Exact behaviour depends on the remote.
What is considered a small file may be set through
`--streaming-upload-cutoff`. Uploading only starts after
the cutoff is reached or if the file ends before that. The data
must fit into RAM. The cutoff needs to be small enough to adhere
the limits of your remote, please see there. Generally speaking,
setting this cutoff too high will decrease your performance.

Use the `--size` flag to preallocate the file in advance at the remote end
and actually stream it, even if remote backend doesn't support streaming.

`--size` should be the exact size of the input stream in bytes. If the
size of the stream is different in length to the `--size` passed in
then the transfer will likely fail.

Note that the upload cannot be retried because the data is not stored.
If the backend supports multipart uploading then individual chunks can
be retried. If you need to transfer a lot of data, you may be better
off caching it locally and then `rclone move` it to the
destination which can use retries.

```
rclone rcat remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help       help for rcat
      --size int   File size hint to preallocate (default -1)
```

Options shared with other commands are described next.

  -v, --verbose count   Print lots more stuff (repeat for more)
```

# rclone rcd

Run rclone listening to remote control commands only.

## Synopsis

This runs rclone so that it only listens to remote control commands.

This is useful if you are controlling rclone via the rc API.

If you pass in a path to a directory, rclone will serve that directory
for GET requests on the URL passed in.  It will also open the URL in
the browser when rclone is run.

See the [rc documentation](https://rclone.org/rc/) for more info on the rc flags.

## Server options

Use `--rc-addr` to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg `--rc-addr 1.2.3.4:8000` or `--rc-addr :8080` to listen to all
IPs.  By default it only listens on localhost.  You can use port
:0 to let the OS choose an available port.

If you set `--rc-addr` to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

You can use a unix socket by setting the url to `unix:///path/to/socket`
or just by using an absolute path name. Note that unix sockets bypass the
authentication - this is expected to be done with file system permissions.

`--rc-addr` may be repeated to listen on multiple IPs/ports/sockets.
Socket activation, described further below, can also be used to accomplish the same.

`--rc-server-read-timeout` and `--rc-server-write-timeout` can be used to
control the timeouts on the server.  Note that this is the total time
for a transfer.

`--rc-max-header-bytes` controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.

`--rc-baseurl` controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.  By default
rclone will serve from the root.  If you used `--rc-baseurl "/rclone"` then
rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/".  This is
useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.  Rclone automatically
inserts leading and trailing "/" on `--rc-baseurl`, so `--rc-baseurl "rclone"`,
`--rc-baseurl "/rclone"` and `--rc-baseurl "/rclone/"` are all treated
identically.

### TLS (SSL)

By default this will serve over http.  If you want you can serve over
https.  You will need to supply the `--rc-cert` and `--rc-key` flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need to
supply `--rc-client-ca` also.

`--rc-cert` should be a either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation
of that with the CA certificate.  `--krc-ey` should be the PEM encoded
private key and `--rc-client-ca` should be the PEM encoded client
certificate authority certificate.

`--rc-min-tls-version` is minimum TLS version that is acceptable. Valid
  values are "tls1.0", "tls1.1", "tls1.2" and "tls1.3" (default
  "tls1.0").

## Socket activation

Instead of the listening addresses specified above, rclone will listen to all
FDs passed by the service manager, if any (and ignore any arguments passed by --rc-addr`).

This allows rclone to be a socket-activated service.
It can be configured with .socket and .service unit files as described in
https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html

Socket activation can be tested ad-hoc with the `systemd-socket-activate`command

       systemd-socket-activate -l 8000 -- rclone serve

This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 8000 over TCP.
### Template

`--rc-template` allows a user to specify a custom markup template for HTTP
and WebDAV serve functions.  The server exports the following markup
to be used within the template to server pages:

| Parameter   | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| .Name       | The full path of a file/directory. |
| .Title      | Directory listing of .Name |
| .Sort       | The current sort used.  This is changeable via ?sort= parameter |
|             | Sort Options: namedirfirst,name,size,time (default namedirfirst) |
| .Order      | The current ordering used.  This is changeable via ?order= parameter |
|             | Order Options: asc,desc (default asc) |
| .Query      | Currently unused. |
| .Breadcrumb | Allows for creating a relative navigation |
|-- .Link     | The relative to the root link of the Text. |
|-- .Text     | The Name of the directory. |
| .Entries    | Information about a specific file/directory. |
|-- .URL      | The 'url' of an entry.  |
|-- .Leaf     | Currently same as 'URL' but intended to be 'just' the name. |
|-- .IsDir    | Boolean for if an entry is a directory or not. |
|-- .Size     | Size in Bytes of the entry. |
|-- .ModTime  | The UTC timestamp of an entry. |

The server also makes the following functions available so that they can be used within the
template. These functions help extend the options for dynamic rendering of HTML. They can
be used to render HTML based on specific conditions.

| Function   | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| afterEpoch  | Returns the time since the epoch for the given time. |
| contains    | Checks whether a given substring is present or not in a given string. |
| hasPrefix   | Checks whether the given string begins with the specified prefix. |
| hasSuffix   | Checks whether the given string end with the specified suffix. |

### Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or
set a single username and password with the `--rc-user` and `--rc-pass` flags.

If no static users are configured by either of the above methods, and client
certificates are required by the `--client-ca` flag passed to the server, the
client certificate common name will be considered as the username.

Use `--rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd` to provide an htpasswd file.  This is
in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic
authentication.  Bcrypt is recommended.

To create an htpasswd file:

    touch htpasswd
    htpasswd -B htpasswd user
    htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser

The password file can be updated while rclone is running.

Use `--rc-realm` to set the authentication realm.

Use `--rc-salt` to change the password hashing salt from the default.

# rclone rmdirs

Remove empty directories under the path.

## Synopsis

This recursively removes any empty directories (including directories
that only contain empty directories), that it finds under the path.
The root path itself will also be removed if it is empty, unless
you supply the `--leave-root` flag.

Use command [rmdir](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rmdir/) to delete just the empty
directory given by path, not recurse.

This is useful for tidying up remotes that rclone has left a lot of
empty directories in. For example the [delete](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_delete/)
command will delete files but leave the directory structure (unless
used with option `--rmdirs`).

This will delete `--checkers` directories concurrently so
if you have thousands of empty directories consider increasing this number.

To delete a path and any objects in it, use the [purge](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_purge/)
command.


```
rclone rmdirs remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help         help for rmdirs
      --leave-root   Do not remove root directory if empty
```

Options shared with other commands are described next.
See the [global flags page](https://rclone.org/flags/) for global options not listed here.

### Important Options

Important flags useful for most commands

```
  -n, --dry-run         Do a trial run with no permanent changes
  -i, --interactive     Enable interactive mode
  -v, --verbose count   Print lots more stuff (repeat for more)
```

# rclone selfupdate

Update the rclone binary.

## Synopsis

This command downloads the latest release of rclone and replaces the
currently running binary. The download is verified with a hashsum and
cryptographically signed signature; see [the release signing
docs](https://rclone.org/release_signing/) for details.

If used without flags (or with implied `--stable` flag), this command
will install the latest stable release. However, some issues may be fixed
(or features added) only in the latest beta release. In such cases you should
run the command with the `--beta` flag, i.e. `rclone selfupdate --beta`.
You can check in advance what version would be installed by adding the
`--check` flag, then repeat the command without it when you are satisfied.

Sometimes the rclone team may recommend you a concrete beta or stable
rclone release to troubleshoot your issue or add a bleeding edge feature.
The `--version VER` flag, if given, will update to the concrete version
instead of the latest one. If you omit micro version from `VER` (for
example `1.53`), the latest matching micro version will be used.

Upon successful update rclone will print a message that contains a previous
version number. You will need it if you later decide to revert your update
for some reason. Then you'll have to note the previous version and run the
following command: `rclone selfupdate [--beta] OLDVER`.
If the old version contains only dots and digits (for example `v1.54.0`)
then it's a stable release so you won't need the `--beta` flag. Beta releases
have an additional information similar to `v1.54.0-beta.5111.06f1c0c61`.
(if you are a developer and use a locally built rclone, the version number
will end with `-DEV`, you will have to rebuild it as it obviously can't
be distributed).

If you previously installed rclone via a package manager, the package may
include local documentation or configure services. You may wish to update
with the flag `--package deb` or `--package rpm` (whichever is correct for
your OS) to update these too. This command with the default `--package zip`
will update only the rclone executable so the local manual may become
inaccurate after it.

The [rclone mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) command may
or may not support extended FUSE options depending on the build and OS.
`selfupdate` will refuse to update if the capability would be discarded.

Note: Windows forbids deletion of a currently running executable so this
command will rename the old executable to 'rclone.old.exe' upon success.

Please note that this command was not available before rclone version 1.55.
If it fails for you with the message `unknown command "selfupdate"` then
you will need to update manually following the install instructions located
at https://rclone.org/install/


```
rclone selfupdate [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --beta             Install beta release
      --check            Check for latest release, do not download
  -h, --help             help for selfupdate
      --output string    Save the downloaded binary at a given path (default: replace running binary)
      --package string   Package format: zip|deb|rpm (default: zip)
      --stable           Install stable release (this is the default)
      --version string   Install the given rclone version (default: latest)
```

# rclone serve dlna

Serve remote:path over DLNA

## Synopsis

Run a DLNA media server for media stored in an rclone remote. Many
devices, such as the Xbox and PlayStation, can automatically discover
this server in the LAN and play audio/video from it. VLC is also
supported. Service discovery uses UDP multicast packets (SSDP) and
will thus only work on LANs.

Rclone will list all files present in the remote, without filtering
based on media formats or file extensions. Additionally, there is no
media transcoding support. This means that some players might show
files that they are not able to play back correctly.

Rclone will add external subtitle files (.srt) to videos if they have the same
filename as the video file itself (except the extension), either in the same
directory as the video, or in a "Subs" subdirectory.

## Server options

Use `--addr` to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, e.g. `--addr 1.2.3.4:8000` or `--addr :8080` to listen to all
IPs.

Use `--name` to choose the friendly server name, which is by
default "rclone (hostname)".

Use `--log-trace` in conjunction with `-vv` to enable additional debug
logging of all UPNP traffic.

## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` note
that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly
because it is only checked every `--vfs-cache-poll-interval`. Secondly
because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When
`--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` is exceeded,
rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache
first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the
longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant
files are likely to remain cached.

The `--vfs-cache-max-age` will evict files from the cache
after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of
1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed
for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0
and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with
standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

### Fingerprinting

Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file
copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made
from:

- size
- modification time
- hash

where available on an object.

On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take
an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).

For example `hash` is slow with the `local` and `sftp` backends as
they have to read the entire file and hash it, and `modtime` is slow
with the `s3`, `swift`, `ftp` and `qinqstor` backends because they
need to do an extra API call to fetch it.

If you use the `--vfs-fast-fingerprint` flag then rclone will not
include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the
fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the
opening time of cached files.

If you are running a vfs cache over `local`, `s3` or `swift` backends
then using this flag is recommended.

Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of
the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to
be downloaded again.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
    --vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once

The chunking behaves differently depending on the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` parameter.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` == 0

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

The chunks will not be buffered in memory.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` > 0

Rclone reads `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` chunks of size
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` concurrently. The size for each read will stay
constant.

This improves performance performance massively on high latency links
or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.

Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` and `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` as these will
depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.

For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to
start might be `--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16` and
`--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M`. In testing with AWS S3 the performance
scaled roughly as the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` setting.

Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on
the latency they may need more `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` in order to
get the throughput.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Only allow read-only access.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from the cache (the related global flag `--checkers` has no effect on the VFS).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` VFS flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by the underlying remote.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

The `--no-unicode-normalization` flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is
performed for filenames that differ but are [canonically
equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence) with respect to
unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS,
which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is
therefore highly recommended to keep the default of `false` on macOS, to avoid
encoding compatibility issues.

In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate
filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the `--vfs-block-norm-dupes`
flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as
rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a
directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not
needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a
remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd
situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount,
and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will
actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. `--vfs-block-
norm-dupes` prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the
duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in `rclone
sync`.

## VFS Disk Options

This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system.
It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.

    --vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

# rclone serve docker

Serve any remote on docker's volume plugin API.

## Synopsis

This command implements the Docker volume plugin API allowing docker to use
rclone as a data storage mechanism for various cloud providers.
rclone provides [docker volume plugin](/docker) based on it.

To create a docker plugin, one must create a Unix or TCP socket that Docker
will look for when you use the plugin and then it listens for commands from
docker daemon and runs the corresponding code when necessary.
Docker plugins can run as a managed plugin under control of the docker daemon
or as an independent native service. For testing, you can just run it directly
from the command line, for example:
```
sudo rclone serve docker --base-dir /tmp/rclone-volumes --socket-addr localhost:8787 -vv
```

Running `rclone serve docker` will create the said socket, listening for
commands from Docker to create the necessary Volumes. Normally you need not
give the `--socket-addr` flag. The API will listen on the unix domain socket
at `/run/docker/plugins/rclone.sock`. In the example above rclone will create
a TCP socket and a small file `/etc/docker/plugins/rclone.spec` containing
the socket address. We use `sudo` because both paths are writeable only by
the root user.

If you later decide to change listening socket, the docker daemon must be
restarted to reconnect to `/run/docker/plugins/rclone.sock`
or parse new `/etc/docker/plugins/rclone.spec`. Until you restart, any
volume related docker commands will timeout trying to access the old socket.
Running directly is supported on **Linux only**, not on Windows or MacOS.
This is not a problem with managed plugin mode described in details
in the [full documentation](https://rclone.org/docker).

The command will create volume mounts under the path given by `--base-dir`
(by default `/var/lib/docker-volumes/rclone` available only to root)
and maintain the JSON formatted file `docker-plugin.state` in the rclone cache
directory with book-keeping records of created and mounted volumes.

All mount and VFS options are submitted by the docker daemon via API, but
you can also provide defaults on the command line as well as set path to the
config file and cache directory or adjust logging verbosity.

## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` note
that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly
because it is only checked every `--vfs-cache-poll-interval`. Secondly
because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When
`--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` is exceeded,
rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache
first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the
longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant
files are likely to remain cached.

The `--vfs-cache-max-age` will evict files from the cache
after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of
1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed
for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0
and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with
standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

### Fingerprinting

Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file
copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made
from:

- size
- modification time
- hash

where available on an object.

On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take
an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).

For example `hash` is slow with the `local` and `sftp` backends as
they have to read the entire file and hash it, and `modtime` is slow
with the `s3`, `swift`, `ftp` and `qinqstor` backends because they
need to do an extra API call to fetch it.

If you use the `--vfs-fast-fingerprint` flag then rclone will not
include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the
fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the
opening time of cached files.

If you are running a vfs cache over `local`, `s3` or `swift` backends
then using this flag is recommended.

Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of
the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to
be downloaded again.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
    --vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once

The chunking behaves differently depending on the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` parameter.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` == 0

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

The chunks will not be buffered in memory.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` > 0

Rclone reads `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` chunks of size
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` concurrently. The size for each read will stay
constant.

This improves performance performance massively on high latency links
or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.

Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` and `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` as these will
depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.

For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to
start might be `--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16` and
`--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M`. In testing with AWS S3 the performance
scaled roughly as the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` setting.

Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on
the latency they may need more `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` in order to
get the throughput.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Only allow read-only access.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from the cache (the related global flag `--checkers` has no effect on the VFS).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` VFS flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by the underlying remote.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

The `--no-unicode-normalization` flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is
performed for filenames that differ but are [canonically
equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence) with respect to
unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS,
which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is
therefore highly recommended to keep the default of `false` on macOS, to avoid
encoding compatibility issues.

In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate
filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the `--vfs-block-norm-dupes`
flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as
rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a
directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not
needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a
remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd
situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount,
and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will
actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. `--vfs-block-
norm-dupes` prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the
duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in `rclone
sync`.

## VFS Disk Options

This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system.
It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.

    --vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

* [rclone serve](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/)	 - Serve a remote over a protocol.

# rclone serve ftp

Serve remote:path over FTP.

## Synopsis

Run a basic FTP server to serve a remote over FTP protocol.
This can be viewed with a FTP client or you can make a remote of
type FTP to read and write it.

## Server options

Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, e.g. --addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all
IPs.  By default it only listens on localhost.  You can use port
:0 to let the OS choose an available port.

If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

### Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can set a single username and password with the --user and --pass flags.

## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` note
that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly
because it is only checked every `--vfs-cache-poll-interval`. Secondly
because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When
`--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` is exceeded,
rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache
first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the
longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant
files are likely to remain cached.

The `--vfs-cache-max-age` will evict files from the cache
after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of
1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed
for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0
and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with
standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

### Fingerprinting

Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file
copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made
from:

- size
- modification time
- hash

where available on an object.

On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take
an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).

For example `hash` is slow with the `local` and `sftp` backends as
they have to read the entire file and hash it, and `modtime` is slow
with the `s3`, `swift`, `ftp` and `qinqstor` backends because they
need to do an extra API call to fetch it.

If you use the `--vfs-fast-fingerprint` flag then rclone will not
include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the
fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the
opening time of cached files.

If you are running a vfs cache over `local`, `s3` or `swift` backends
then using this flag is recommended.

Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of
the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to
be downloaded again.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
    --vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once

The chunking behaves differently depending on the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` parameter.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` == 0

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

The chunks will not be buffered in memory.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` > 0

Rclone reads `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` chunks of size
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` concurrently. The size for each read will stay
constant.

This improves performance performance massively on high latency links
or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.

Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` and `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` as these will
depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.

For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to
start might be `--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16` and
`--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M`. In testing with AWS S3 the performance
scaled roughly as the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` setting.

Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on
the latency they may need more `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` in order to
get the throughput.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Only allow read-only access.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from the cache (the related global flag `--checkers` has no effect on the VFS).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` VFS flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by the underlying remote.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

The `--no-unicode-normalization` flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is
performed for filenames that differ but are [canonically
equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence) with respect to
unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS,
which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is
therefore highly recommended to keep the default of `false` on macOS, to avoid
encoding compatibility issues.

In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate
filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the `--vfs-block-norm-dupes`
flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as
rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a
directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not
needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a
remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd
situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount,
and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will
actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. `--vfs-block-
norm-dupes` prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the
duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in `rclone
sync`.

## VFS Disk Options

This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system.
It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.

    --vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

## Auth Proxy

If you supply the parameter `--auth-proxy /path/to/program` then
rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which
then are used to authenticate incoming requests.  This uses a simple
JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.

**PLEASE NOTE:** `--auth-proxy` and `--authorized-keys` cannot be used
together, if `--auth-proxy` is set the authorized keys option will be
ignored.

There is an example program
[bin/test_proxy.py](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/bin/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.

The program's job is to take a `user` and `pass` on the input and turn
those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format.  This
config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but it
won't use configuration from environment variables or command line
options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete
config.

This config generated must have this extra parameter
- `_root` - root to use for the backend

And it may have this parameter
- `_obscure` - comma separated strings for parameters to obscure

If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

```
{
	"user": "me",
	"pass": "mypassword"
}
```

If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the
proxy process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

```
{
	"user": "me",
	"public_key": "AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf"
}
```

And as an example return this on STDOUT

```
{
	"type": "sftp",
	"_root": "",
	"_obscure": "pass",
	"user": "me",
	"pass": "mypassword",
	"host": "sftp.example.com"
}
```

This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for
the `user` and `pass`/`public_key` returned in the output to the host given.  Note
that since `_obscure` is set to `pass`, rclone will obscure the `pass`
parameter before creating the backend (which is required for sftp
backends).

The program can manipulate the supplied `user` in any way, for example
to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the
`user` be `user@example.com` and then set the `host` to `example.com`
in the output and the user to `user`. For security you'd probably want
to restrict the `host` to a limited list.

Note that an internal cache is keyed on `user` so only use that for
configuration, don't use `pass` or `public_key`.  This also means that if a user's
password or public-key is changed the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins)
before it takes effect.

This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of
backend that rclone supports.

## See Also

* [rclone serve](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/)	 - Serve a remote over a protocol.

# rclone serve http

Serve the remote over HTTP.

## Synopsis

Run a basic web server to serve a remote over HTTP.
This can be viewed in a web browser or you can make a remote of type
http read from it.

You can use the filter flags (e.g. `--include`, `--exclude`) to control what
is served.

The server will log errors.  Use `-v` to see access logs.

`--bwlimit` will be respected for file transfers.  Use `--stats` to
control the stats printing.

## Server options

Use `--addr` to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg `--addr 1.2.3.4:8000` or `--addr :8080` to listen to all
IPs.  By default it only listens on localhost.  You can use port
:0 to let the OS choose an available port.

If you set `--addr` to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

You can use a unix socket by setting the url to `unix:///path/to/socket`
or just by using an absolute path name. Note that unix sockets bypass the
authentication - this is expected to be done with file system permissions.

`--addr` may be repeated to listen on multiple IPs/ports/sockets.
Socket activation, described further below, can also be used to accomplish the same.

`--server-read-timeout` and `--server-write-timeout` can be used to
control the timeouts on the server.  Note that this is the total time
for a transfer.

`--max-header-bytes` controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.

`--baseurl` controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.  By default
rclone will serve from the root.  If you used `--baseurl "/rclone"` then
rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/".  This is
useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.  Rclone automatically
inserts leading and trailing "/" on `--baseurl`, so `--baseurl "rclone"`,
`--baseurl "/rclone"` and `--baseurl "/rclone/"` are all treated
identically.

### TLS (SSL)

By default this will serve over http.  If you want you can serve over
https.  You will need to supply the `--cert` and `--key` flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need to
supply `--client-ca` also.

`--cert` should be a either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation
of that with the CA certificate.  `--key` should be the PEM encoded
private key and `--client-ca` should be the PEM encoded client
certificate authority certificate.

`--min-tls-version` is minimum TLS version that is acceptable. Valid
  values are "tls1.0", "tls1.1", "tls1.2" and "tls1.3" (default
  "tls1.0").

## Socket activation

Instead of the listening addresses specified above, rclone will listen to all
FDs passed by the service manager, if any (and ignore any arguments passed by --addr`).

This allows rclone to be a socket-activated service.
It can be configured with .socket and .service unit files as described in
https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html

Socket activation can be tested ad-hoc with the `systemd-socket-activate`command

       systemd-socket-activate -l 8000 -- rclone serve

This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 8000 over TCP.
### Template

`--template` allows a user to specify a custom markup template for HTTP
and WebDAV serve functions.  The server exports the following markup
to be used within the template to server pages:

| Parameter   | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| .Name       | The full path of a file/directory. |
| .Title      | Directory listing of .Name |
| .Sort       | The current sort used.  This is changeable via ?sort= parameter |
|             | Sort Options: namedirfirst,name,size,time (default namedirfirst) |
| .Order      | The current ordering used.  This is changeable via ?order= parameter |
|             | Order Options: asc,desc (default asc) |
| .Query      | Currently unused. |
| .Breadcrumb | Allows for creating a relative navigation |
|-- .Link     | The relative to the root link of the Text. |
|-- .Text     | The Name of the directory. |
| .Entries    | Information about a specific file/directory. |
|-- .URL      | The 'url' of an entry.  |
|-- .Leaf     | Currently same as 'URL' but intended to be 'just' the name. |
|-- .IsDir    | Boolean for if an entry is a directory or not. |
|-- .Size     | Size in Bytes of the entry. |
|-- .ModTime  | The UTC timestamp of an entry. |

The server also makes the following functions available so that they can be used within the
template. These functions help extend the options for dynamic rendering of HTML. They can
be used to render HTML based on specific conditions.

| Function   | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| afterEpoch  | Returns the time since the epoch for the given time. |
| contains    | Checks whether a given substring is present or not in a given string. |
| hasPrefix   | Checks whether the given string begins with the specified prefix. |
| hasSuffix   | Checks whether the given string end with the specified suffix. |

### Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or
set a single username and password with the `--user` and `--pass` flags.

If no static users are configured by either of the above methods, and client
certificates are required by the `--client-ca` flag passed to the server, the
client certificate common name will be considered as the username.

Use `--htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd` to provide an htpasswd file.  This is
in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic
authentication.  Bcrypt is recommended.

To create an htpasswd file:

    touch htpasswd
    htpasswd -B htpasswd user
    htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser

The password file can be updated while rclone is running.

Use `--realm` to set the authentication realm.

Use `--salt` to change the password hashing salt from the default.

## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` note
that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly
because it is only checked every `--vfs-cache-poll-interval`. Secondly
because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When
`--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` is exceeded,
rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache
first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the
longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant
files are likely to remain cached.

The `--vfs-cache-max-age` will evict files from the cache
after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of
1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed
for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0
and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with
standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

### Fingerprinting

Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file
copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made
from:

- size
- modification time
- hash

where available on an object.

On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take
an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).

For example `hash` is slow with the `local` and `sftp` backends as
they have to read the entire file and hash it, and `modtime` is slow
with the `s3`, `swift`, `ftp` and `qinqstor` backends because they
need to do an extra API call to fetch it.

If you use the `--vfs-fast-fingerprint` flag then rclone will not
include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the
fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the
opening time of cached files.

If you are running a vfs cache over `local`, `s3` or `swift` backends
then using this flag is recommended.

Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of
the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to
be downloaded again.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
    --vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once

The chunking behaves differently depending on the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` parameter.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` == 0

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

The chunks will not be buffered in memory.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` > 0

Rclone reads `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` chunks of size
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` concurrently. The size for each read will stay
constant.

This improves performance performance massively on high latency links
or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.

Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` and `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` as these will
depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.

For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to
start might be `--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16` and
`--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M`. In testing with AWS S3 the performance
scaled roughly as the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` setting.

Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on
the latency they may need more `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` in order to
get the throughput.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Only allow read-only access.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from the cache (the related global flag `--checkers` has no effect on the VFS).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` VFS flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by the underlying remote.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

The `--no-unicode-normalization` flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is
performed for filenames that differ but are [canonically
equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence) with respect to
unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS,
which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is
therefore highly recommended to keep the default of `false` on macOS, to avoid
encoding compatibility issues.

In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate
filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the `--vfs-block-norm-dupes`
flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as
rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a
directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not
needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a
remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd
situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount,
and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will
actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. `--vfs-block-
norm-dupes` prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the
duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in `rclone
sync`.

## VFS Disk Options

This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system.
It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.

    --vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

## Auth Proxy

If you supply the parameter `--auth-proxy /path/to/program` then
rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which
then are used to authenticate incoming requests.  This uses a simple
JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.

**PLEASE NOTE:** `--auth-proxy` and `--authorized-keys` cannot be used
together, if `--auth-proxy` is set the authorized keys option will be
ignored.

There is an example program
[bin/test_proxy.py](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/bin/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.

The program's job is to take a `user` and `pass` on the input and turn
those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format.  This
config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but it
won't use configuration from environment variables or command line
options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete
config.

This config generated must have this extra parameter
- `_root` - root to use for the backend

And it may have this parameter
- `_obscure` - comma separated strings for parameters to obscure

If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

```
{
	"user": "me",
	"pass": "mypassword"
}
```

If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the
proxy process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

```
{
	"user": "me",
	"public_key": "AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf"
}
```

And as an example return this on STDOUT

```
{
	"type": "sftp",
	"_root": "",
	"_obscure": "pass",
	"user": "me",
	"pass": "mypassword",
	"host": "sftp.example.com"
}
```

This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for
the `user` and `pass`/`public_key` returned in the output to the host given.  Note
that since `_obscure` is set to `pass`, rclone will obscure the `pass`
parameter before creating the backend (which is required for sftp
backends).

The program can manipulate the supplied `user` in any way, for example
to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the
`user` be `user@example.com` and then set the `host` to `example.com`
in the output and the user to `user`. For security you'd probably want
to restrict the `host` to a limited list.

Note that an internal cache is keyed on `user` so only use that for
configuration, don't use `pass` or `public_key`.  This also means that if a user's
password or public-key is changed the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins)
before it takes effect.

This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of
backend that rclone supports.

# rclone serve nfs

Serve the remote as an NFS mount

## Synopsis

Create an NFS server that serves the given remote over the network.
	
This implements an NFSv3 server to serve any rclone remote via NFS.

The primary purpose for this command is to enable the [mount
command](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) on recent macOS versions where
installing FUSE is very cumbersome.

This server does not implement any authentication so any client will be
able to access the data. To limit access, you can use `serve nfs` on
the loopback address or rely on secure tunnels (such as SSH) or use
firewalling.

For this reason, by default, a random TCP port is chosen and the
loopback interface is used for the listening address by default;
meaning that it is only available to the local machine. If you want
other machines to access the NFS mount over local network, you need to
specify the listening address and port using the `--addr` flag.

Modifying files through the NFS protocol requires VFS caching. Usually
you will need to specify `--vfs-cache-mode` in order to be able to
write to the mountpoint (`full` is recommended). If you don't specify
VFS cache mode, the mount will be read-only.

`--nfs-cache-type` controls the type of the NFS handle cache. By
default this is `memory` where new handles will be randomly allocated
when needed. These are stored in memory. If the server is restarted
the handle cache will be lost and connected NFS clients will get stale
handle errors.

`--nfs-cache-type disk` uses an on disk NFS handle cache. Rclone
hashes the path of the object and stores it in a file named after the
hash. These hashes are stored on disk the directory controlled by
`--cache-dir` or the exact directory may be specified with
`--nfs-cache-dir`. Using this means that the NFS server can be
restarted at will without affecting the connected clients.

`--nfs-cache-type symlink` is similar to `--nfs-cache-type disk` in
that it uses an on disk cache, but the cache entries are held as
symlinks. Rclone will use the handle of the underlying file as the NFS
handle which improves performance. This sort of cache can't be backed
up and restored as the underlying handles will change. This is Linux
only.

`--nfs-cache-handle-limit` controls the maximum number of cached NFS
handles stored by the caching handler. This should not be set too low
or you may experience errors when trying to access files. The default
is `1000000`, but consider lowering this limit if the server's system
resource usage causes problems. This is only used by the `memory` type
cache.

To serve NFS over the network use following command:

    rclone serve nfs remote: --addr 0.0.0.0:$PORT --vfs-cache-mode=full

This specifies a port that can be used in the mount command. To mount
the server under Linux/macOS, use the following command:
    
    mount -t nfs -o port=$PORT,mountport=$PORT,tcp $HOSTNAME:/ path/to/mountpoint

Where `$PORT` is the same port number used in the `serve nfs` command
and `$HOSTNAME` is the network address of the machine that `serve nfs`
was run on.

This command is only available on Unix platforms.

## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` note
that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly
because it is only checked every `--vfs-cache-poll-interval`. Secondly
because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When
`--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` is exceeded,
rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache
first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the
longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant
files are likely to remain cached.

The `--vfs-cache-max-age` will evict files from the cache
after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of
1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed
for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0
and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with
standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

### Fingerprinting

Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file
copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made
from:

- size
- modification time
- hash

where available on an object.

On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take
an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).

For example `hash` is slow with the `local` and `sftp` backends as
they have to read the entire file and hash it, and `modtime` is slow
with the `s3`, `swift`, `ftp` and `qinqstor` backends because they
need to do an extra API call to fetch it.

If you use the `--vfs-fast-fingerprint` flag then rclone will not
include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the
fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the
opening time of cached files.

If you are running a vfs cache over `local`, `s3` or `swift` backends
then using this flag is recommended.

Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of
the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to
be downloaded again.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
    --vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once

The chunking behaves differently depending on the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` parameter.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` == 0

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

The chunks will not be buffered in memory.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` > 0

Rclone reads `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` chunks of size
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` concurrently. The size for each read will stay
constant.

This improves performance performance massively on high latency links
or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.

Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` and `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` as these will
depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.

For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to
start might be `--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16` and
`--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M`. In testing with AWS S3 the performance
scaled roughly as the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` setting.

Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on
the latency they may need more `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` in order to
get the throughput.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Only allow read-only access.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from the cache (the related global flag `--checkers` has no effect on the VFS).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` VFS flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by the underlying remote.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

The `--no-unicode-normalization` flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is
performed for filenames that differ but are [canonically
equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence) with respect to
unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS,
which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is
therefore highly recommended to keep the default of `false` on macOS, to avoid
encoding compatibility issues.

In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate
filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the `--vfs-block-norm-dupes`
flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as
rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a
directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not
needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a
remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd
situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount,
and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will
actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. `--vfs-block-
norm-dupes` prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the
duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in `rclone
sync`.

## VFS Disk Options

This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system.
It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.

    --vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

## See Also

* [rclone serve](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/)	 - Serve a remote over a protocol.

# rclone serve restic

Serve the remote for restic's REST API.

## Synopsis

Run a basic web server to serve a remote over restic's REST backend
API over HTTP.  This allows restic to use rclone as a data storage
mechanism for cloud providers that restic does not support directly.

[Restic](https://restic.net/) is a command-line program for doing
backups.

The server will log errors.  Use -v to see access logs.

`--bwlimit` will be respected for file transfers.
Use `--stats` to control the stats printing.

## Setting up rclone for use by restic ###

First [set up a remote for your chosen cloud provider](https://rclone.org/docs/#configure).

Once you have set up the remote, check it is working with, for example
"rclone lsd remote:".  You may have called the remote something other
than "remote:" - just substitute whatever you called it in the
following instructions.

Now start the rclone restic server

    rclone serve restic -v remote:backup

Where you can replace "backup" in the above by whatever path in the
remote you wish to use.

By default this will serve on "localhost:8080" you can change this
with use of the `--addr` flag.

You might wish to start this server on boot.

Adding `--cache-objects=false` will cause rclone to stop caching objects
returned from the List call. Caching is normally desirable as it speeds
up downloading objects, saves transactions and uses very little memory.

## Setting up restic to use rclone ###

Now you can [follow the restic
instructions](http://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#rest-server)
on setting up restic.

Note that you will need restic 0.8.2 or later to interoperate with
rclone.

For the example above you will want to use "http://localhost:8080/" as
the URL for the REST server.

For example:

    $ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/
    $ export RESTIC_PASSWORD=yourpassword
    $ restic init
    created restic backend 8b1a4b56ae at rest:http://localhost:8080/

    Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access
    the repository. Losing your password means that your data is
    irrecoverably lost.
    $ restic backup /path/to/files/to/backup
    scan [/path/to/files/to/backup]
    scanned 189 directories, 312 files in 0:00
    [0:00] 100.00%  38.128 MiB / 38.128 MiB  501 / 501 items  0 errors  ETA 0:00
    duration: 0:00
    snapshot 45c8fdd8 saved

### Multiple repositories ####

Note that you can use the endpoint to host multiple repositories.  Do
this by adding a directory name or path after the URL.  Note that
these **must** end with /.  Eg

    $ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user1repo/
    # backup user1 stuff
    $ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user2repo/
    # backup user2 stuff

### Private repositories ####

The`--private-repos` flag can be used to limit users to repositories starting
with a path of `/<username>/`.

## Server options

Use `--addr` to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg `--addr 1.2.3.4:8000` or `--addr :8080` to listen to all
IPs.  By default it only listens on localhost.  You can use port
:0 to let the OS choose an available port.

If you set `--addr` to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

You can use a unix socket by setting the url to `unix:///path/to/socket`
or just by using an absolute path name. Note that unix sockets bypass the
authentication - this is expected to be done with file system permissions.

`--addr` may be repeated to listen on multiple IPs/ports/sockets.
Socket activation, described further below, can also be used to accomplish the same.

`--server-read-timeout` and `--server-write-timeout` can be used to
control the timeouts on the server.  Note that this is the total time
for a transfer.

`--max-header-bytes` controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.

`--baseurl` controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.  By default
rclone will serve from the root.  If you used `--baseurl "/rclone"` then
rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/".  This is
useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.  Rclone automatically
inserts leading and trailing "/" on `--baseurl`, so `--baseurl "rclone"`,
`--baseurl "/rclone"` and `--baseurl "/rclone/"` are all treated
identically.

### TLS (SSL)

By default this will serve over http.  If you want you can serve over
https.  You will need to supply the `--cert` and `--key` flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need to
supply `--client-ca` also.

`--cert` should be a either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation
of that with the CA certificate.  `--key` should be the PEM encoded
private key and `--client-ca` should be the PEM encoded client
certificate authority certificate.

`--min-tls-version` is minimum TLS version that is acceptable. Valid
  values are "tls1.0", "tls1.1", "tls1.2" and "tls1.3" (default
  "tls1.0").

## Socket activation

Instead of the listening addresses specified above, rclone will listen to all
FDs passed by the service manager, if any (and ignore any arguments passed by --addr`).

This allows rclone to be a socket-activated service.
It can be configured with .socket and .service unit files as described in
https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html

Socket activation can be tested ad-hoc with the `systemd-socket-activate`command

       systemd-socket-activate -l 8000 -- rclone serve

This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 8000 over TCP.
### Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or
set a single username and password with the `--user` and `--pass` flags.

If no static users are configured by either of the above methods, and client
certificates are required by the `--client-ca` flag passed to the server, the
client certificate common name will be considered as the username.

Use `--htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd` to provide an htpasswd file.  This is
in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic
authentication.  Bcrypt is recommended.

To create an htpasswd file:

    touch htpasswd
    htpasswd -B htpasswd user
    htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser

The password file can be updated while rclone is running.

Use `--realm` to set the authentication realm.

Use `--salt` to change the password hashing salt from the default.

      --private-repos                   Users can only access their private repo
      --realm string                    Realm for authentication
      --salt string                     Password hashing salt (default "dlPL2MqE")
      --server-read-timeout Duration    Timeout for server reading data (default 1h0m0s)

# rclone serve s3

Serve remote:path over s3.

## Synopsis

`serve s3` implements a basic s3 server that serves a remote via s3.
This can be viewed with an s3 client, or you can make an [s3 type
remote](https://rclone.org/s3/) to read and write to it with rclone.

`serve s3` is considered **Experimental** so use with care.

S3 server supports Signature Version 4 authentication. Just use
`--auth-key accessKey,secretKey` and set the `Authorization`
header correctly in the request. (See the [AWS
docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)).

`--auth-key` can be repeated for multiple auth pairs. If
`--auth-key` is not provided then `serve s3` will allow anonymous
access.

Please note that some clients may require HTTPS endpoints. See [the
SSL docs](#ssl-tls) for more information.

This command uses the [VFS directory cache](#vfs-virtual-file-system).
All the functionality will work with `--vfs-cache-mode off`. Using
`--vfs-cache-mode full` (or `writes`) can be used to cache objects
locally to improve performance.

Use `--force-path-style=false` if you want to use the bucket name as a
part of the hostname (such as mybucket.local)

Use `--etag-hash` if you want to change the hash uses for the `ETag`.
Note that using anything other than `MD5` (the default) is likely to
cause problems for S3 clients which rely on the Etag being the MD5.

## Quickstart

For a simple set up, to serve `remote:path` over s3, run the server
like this:

```
rclone serve s3 --auth-key ACCESS_KEY_ID,SECRET_ACCESS_KEY remote:path
```

For example, to use a simple folder in the filesystem, run the server
with a command like this:

```
rclone serve s3 --auth-key ACCESS_KEY_ID,SECRET_ACCESS_KEY local:/path/to/folder
```

The `rclone.conf` for the server could look like this:

```
[local]
type = local
```

The `local` configuration is optional though. If you run the server with a
`remote:path` like `/path/to/folder` (without the `local:` prefix and without an
`rclone.conf` file), rclone will fall back to a default configuration, which
will be visible as a warning in the logs. But it will run nonetheless.

This will be compatible with an rclone (client) remote configuration which
is defined like this:

```
[serves3]
type = s3
provider = Rclone
endpoint = http://127.0.0.1:8080/
access_key_id = ACCESS_KEY_ID
secret_access_key = SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
use_multipart_uploads = false
```

Note that setting `disable_multipart_uploads = true` is to work around
[a bug](#bugs) which will be fixed in due course.

## Bugs

When uploading multipart files `serve s3` holds all the parts in
memory (see [#7453](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7453)).
This is a limitaton of the library rclone uses for serving S3 and will
hopefully be fixed at some point.

Multipart server side copies do not work (see
[#7454](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7454)). These take a
very long time and eventually fail. The default threshold for
multipart server side copies is 5G which is the maximum it can be, so
files above this side will fail to be server side copied.

For a current list of `serve s3` bugs see the [serve
s3](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/labels/serve%20s3) bug category
on GitHub.

## Limitations

`serve s3` will treat all directories in the root as buckets and
ignore all files in the root. You can use `CreateBucket` to create
folders under the root, but you can't create empty folders under other
folders not in the root.

When using `PutObject` or `DeleteObject`, rclone will automatically
create or clean up empty folders. If you don't want to clean up empty
folders automatically, use `--no-cleanup`.

When using `ListObjects`, rclone will use `/` when the delimiter is
empty. This reduces backend requests with no effect on most
operations, but if the delimiter is something other than `/` and
empty, rclone will do a full recursive search of the backend, which
can take some time.

Versioning is not currently supported.

Metadata will only be saved in memory other than the rclone `mtime`
metadata which will be set as the modification time of the file.

## Supported operations

`serve s3` currently supports the following operations.

- Bucket
    - `ListBuckets`
    - `CreateBucket`
    - `DeleteBucket`
- Object
    - `HeadObject`
    - `ListObjects`
    - `GetObject`
    - `PutObject`
    - `DeleteObject`
    - `DeleteObjects`
    - `CreateMultipartUpload`
    - `CompleteMultipartUpload`
    - `AbortMultipartUpload`
    - `CopyObject`
    - `UploadPart`

Other operations will return error `Unimplemented`.

### Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or
set a single username and password with the `--user` and `--pass` flags.

If no static users are configured by either of the above methods, and client
certificates are required by the `--client-ca` flag passed to the server, the
client certificate common name will be considered as the username.

Use `--htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd` to provide an htpasswd file.  This is
in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic
authentication.  Bcrypt is recommended.

To create an htpasswd file:

    touch htpasswd
    htpasswd -B htpasswd user
    htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser

The password file can be updated while rclone is running.

Use `--realm` to set the authentication realm.

Use `--salt` to change the password hashing salt from the default.

## Server options

Use `--addr` to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg `--addr 1.2.3.4:8000` or `--addr :8080` to listen to all
IPs.  By default it only listens on localhost.  You can use port
:0 to let the OS choose an available port.

If you set `--addr` to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

You can use a unix socket by setting the url to `unix:///path/to/socket`
or just by using an absolute path name. Note that unix sockets bypass the
authentication - this is expected to be done with file system permissions.

`--addr` may be repeated to listen on multiple IPs/ports/sockets.
Socket activation, described further below, can also be used to accomplish the same.

`--server-read-timeout` and `--server-write-timeout` can be used to
control the timeouts on the server.  Note that this is the total time
for a transfer.

`--max-header-bytes` controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.

`--baseurl` controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.  By default
rclone will serve from the root.  If you used `--baseurl "/rclone"` then
rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/".  This is
useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.  Rclone automatically
inserts leading and trailing "/" on `--baseurl`, so `--baseurl "rclone"`,
`--baseurl "/rclone"` and `--baseurl "/rclone/"` are all treated
identically.

### TLS (SSL)

By default this will serve over http.  If you want you can serve over
https.  You will need to supply the `--cert` and `--key` flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need to
supply `--client-ca` also.

`--cert` should be a either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation
of that with the CA certificate.  `--key` should be the PEM encoded
private key and `--client-ca` should be the PEM encoded client
certificate authority certificate.

`--min-tls-version` is minimum TLS version that is acceptable. Valid
  values are "tls1.0", "tls1.1", "tls1.2" and "tls1.3" (default
  "tls1.0").

## Socket activation

Instead of the listening addresses specified above, rclone will listen to all
FDs passed by the service manager, if any (and ignore any arguments passed by --addr`).

This allows rclone to be a socket-activated service.
It can be configured with .socket and .service unit files as described in
https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html

Socket activation can be tested ad-hoc with the `systemd-socket-activate`command

       systemd-socket-activate -l 8000 -- rclone serve

This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 8000 over TCP.
## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` note
that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly
because it is only checked every `--vfs-cache-poll-interval`. Secondly
because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When
`--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` is exceeded,
rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache
first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the
longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant
files are likely to remain cached.

The `--vfs-cache-max-age` will evict files from the cache
after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of
1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed
for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0
and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with
standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

### Fingerprinting

Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file
copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made
from:

- size
- modification time
- hash

where available on an object.

On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take
an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).

For example `hash` is slow with the `local` and `sftp` backends as
they have to read the entire file and hash it, and `modtime` is slow
with the `s3`, `swift`, `ftp` and `qinqstor` backends because they
need to do an extra API call to fetch it.

If you use the `--vfs-fast-fingerprint` flag then rclone will not
include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the
fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the
opening time of cached files.

If you are running a vfs cache over `local`, `s3` or `swift` backends
then using this flag is recommended.

Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of
the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to
be downloaded again.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
    --vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once

The chunking behaves differently depending on the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` parameter.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` == 0

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

The chunks will not be buffered in memory.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` > 0

Rclone reads `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` chunks of size
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` concurrently. The size for each read will stay
constant.

This improves performance performance massively on high latency links
or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.

Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` and `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` as these will
depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.

For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to
start might be `--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16` and
`--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M`. In testing with AWS S3 the performance
scaled roughly as the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` setting.

Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on
the latency they may need more `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` in order to
get the throughput.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Only allow read-only access.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from the cache (the related global flag `--checkers` has no effect on the VFS).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` VFS flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by the underlying remote.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

The `--no-unicode-normalization` flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is
performed for filenames that differ but are [canonically
equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence) with respect to
unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS,
which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is
therefore highly recommended to keep the default of `false` on macOS, to avoid
encoding compatibility issues.

In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate
filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the `--vfs-block-norm-dupes`
flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as
rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a
directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not
needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a
remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd
situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount,
and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will
actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. `--vfs-block-
norm-dupes` prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the
duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in `rclone
sync`.

## VFS Disk Options

This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system.
It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.

    --vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

# rclone serve sftp

Serve the remote over SFTP.

## Synopsis

Run an SFTP server to serve a remote over SFTP. This can be used
with an SFTP client or you can make a remote of type [sftp](/sftp) to use with it.

You can use the [filter](/filtering) flags (e.g. `--include`, `--exclude`)
to control what is served.

The server will respond to a small number of shell commands, mainly
md5sum, sha1sum and df, which enable it to provide support for checksums
and the about feature when accessed from an sftp remote.

Note that this server uses standard 32 KiB packet payload size, which
means you must not configure the client to expect anything else, e.g.
with the [chunk_size](https://rclone.org/sftp/#sftp-chunk-size) option on an sftp remote.

The server will log errors.  Use `-v` to see access logs.

`--bwlimit` will be respected for file transfers.
Use `--stats` to control the stats printing.

You must provide some means of authentication, either with
`--user`/`--pass`, an authorized keys file (specify location with
`--authorized-keys` - the default is the same as ssh), an
`--auth-proxy`, or set the `--no-auth` flag for no
authentication when logging in.

If you don't supply a host `--key` then rclone will generate rsa, ecdsa
and ed25519 variants, and cache them for later use in rclone's cache
directory (see `rclone help flags cache-dir`) in the "serve-sftp"
directory.

By default the server binds to localhost:2022 - if you want it to be
reachable externally then supply `--addr :2022` for example.

This also supports being run with socket activation, in which case it will
listen on the first passed FD.
It can be configured with .socket and .service unit files as described in
https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html

Socket activation can be tested ad-hoc with the `systemd-socket-activate`command:

	systemd-socket-activate -l 2222 -- rclone serve sftp :local:vfs/

This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 2222 over TCP.

Note that the default of `--vfs-cache-mode off` is fine for the rclone
sftp backend, but it may not be with other SFTP clients.

If `--stdio` is specified, rclone will serve SFTP over stdio, which can
be used with sshd via ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, for example:

    restrict,command="rclone serve sftp --stdio ./photos" ssh-rsa ...

On the client you need to set `--transfers 1` when using `--stdio`.
Otherwise multiple instances of the rclone server are started by OpenSSH
which can lead to "corrupted on transfer" errors. This is the case because
the client chooses indiscriminately which server to send commands to while
the servers all have different views of the state of the filing system.

The "restrict" in authorized_keys prevents SHA1SUMs and MD5SUMs from being
used. Omitting "restrict" and using  `--sftp-path-override` to enable
checksumming is possible but less secure and you could use the SFTP server
provided by OpenSSH in this case.

## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` note
that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly
because it is only checked every `--vfs-cache-poll-interval`. Secondly
because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When
`--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` is exceeded,
rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache
first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the
longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant
files are likely to remain cached.

The `--vfs-cache-max-age` will evict files from the cache
after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of
1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed
for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0
and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with
standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

### Fingerprinting

Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file
copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made
from:

- size
- modification time
- hash

where available on an object.

On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take
an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).

For example `hash` is slow with the `local` and `sftp` backends as
they have to read the entire file and hash it, and `modtime` is slow
with the `s3`, `swift`, `ftp` and `qinqstor` backends because they
need to do an extra API call to fetch it.

If you use the `--vfs-fast-fingerprint` flag then rclone will not
include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the
fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the
opening time of cached files.

If you are running a vfs cache over `local`, `s3` or `swift` backends
then using this flag is recommended.

Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of
the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to
be downloaded again.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
    --vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once

The chunking behaves differently depending on the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` parameter.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` == 0

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

The chunks will not be buffered in memory.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` > 0

Rclone reads `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` chunks of size
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` concurrently. The size for each read will stay
constant.

This improves performance performance massively on high latency links
or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.

Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` and `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` as these will
depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.

For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to
start might be `--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16` and
`--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M`. In testing with AWS S3 the performance
scaled roughly as the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` setting.

Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on
the latency they may need more `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` in order to
get the throughput.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Only allow read-only access.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from the cache (the related global flag `--checkers` has no effect on the VFS).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` VFS flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by the underlying remote.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

The `--no-unicode-normalization` flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is
performed for filenames that differ but are [canonically
equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence) with respect to
unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS,
which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is
therefore highly recommended to keep the default of `false` on macOS, to avoid
encoding compatibility issues.

In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate
filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the `--vfs-block-norm-dupes`
flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as
rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a
directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not
needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a
remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd
situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount,
and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will
actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. `--vfs-block-
norm-dupes` prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the
duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in `rclone
sync`.

## VFS Disk Options

This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system.
It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.

    --vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

## Auth Proxy

If you supply the parameter `--auth-proxy /path/to/program` then
rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which
then are used to authenticate incoming requests.  This uses a simple
JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.

**PLEASE NOTE:** `--auth-proxy` and `--authorized-keys` cannot be used
together, if `--auth-proxy` is set the authorized keys option will be
ignored.

There is an example program
[bin/test_proxy.py](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/bin/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.

The program's job is to take a `user` and `pass` on the input and turn
those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format.  This
config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but it
won't use configuration from environment variables or command line
options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete
config.

This config generated must have this extra parameter
- `_root` - root to use for the backend

And it may have this parameter
- `_obscure` - comma separated strings for parameters to obscure

If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

```
{
	"user": "me",
	"pass": "mypassword"
}
```

If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the
proxy process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

```
{
	"user": "me",
	"public_key": "AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf"
}
```

And as an example return this on STDOUT

```
{
	"type": "sftp",
	"_root": "",
	"_obscure": "pass",
	"user": "me",
	"pass": "mypassword",
	"host": "sftp.example.com"
}
```

This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for
the `user` and `pass`/`public_key` returned in the output to the host given.  Note
that since `_obscure` is set to `pass`, rclone will obscure the `pass`
parameter before creating the backend (which is required for sftp
backends).

The program can manipulate the supplied `user` in any way, for example
to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the
`user` be `user@example.com` and then set the `host` to `example.com`
in the output and the user to `user`. For security you'd probably want
to restrict the `host` to a limited list.

Note that an internal cache is keyed on `user` so only use that for
configuration, don't use `pass` or `public_key`.  This also means that if a user's
password or public-key is changed the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins)
before it takes effect.

This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of
backend that rclone supports.

* [rclone serve](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/)	 - Serve a remote over a protocol.

# rclone serve webdav

Serve remote:path over WebDAV.

## Synopsis

Run a basic WebDAV server to serve a remote over HTTP via the
WebDAV protocol. This can be viewed with a WebDAV client, through a web
browser, or you can make a remote of type WebDAV to read and write it.

## WebDAV options

### --etag-hash 

This controls the ETag header.  Without this flag the ETag will be
based on the ModTime and Size of the object.

If this flag is set to "auto" then rclone will choose the first
supported hash on the backend or you can use a named hash such as
"MD5" or "SHA-1". Use the [hashsum](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_hashsum/) command
to see the full list.

## Access WebDAV on Windows

WebDAV shared folder can be mapped as a drive on Windows, however the default settings prevent it.
Windows will fail to connect to the server using insecure Basic authentication.
It will not even display any login dialog. Windows requires SSL / HTTPS connection to be used with Basic.
If you try to connect via Add Network Location Wizard you will get the following error:
"The folder you entered does not appear to be valid. Please choose another".
However, you still can connect if you set the following registry key on a client machine:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Parameters\BasicAuthLevel to 2.
The BasicAuthLevel can be set to the following values:
    0 - Basic authentication disabled
    1 - Basic authentication enabled for SSL connections only
    2 - Basic authentication enabled for SSL connections and for non-SSL connections
If required, increase the FileSizeLimitInBytes to a higher value.
Navigate to the Services interface, then restart the WebClient service.

## Access Office applications on WebDAV

Navigate to following registry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\[14.0/15.0/16.0]\Common\Internet
Create a new DWORD BasicAuthLevel with value 2.
    0 - Basic authentication disabled
    1 - Basic authentication enabled for SSL connections only
    2 - Basic authentication enabled for SSL and for non-SSL connections

## Serving over a unix socket

You can serve the webdav on a unix socket like this:

    rclone serve webdav --addr unix:///tmp/my.socket remote:path

and connect to it like this using rclone and the webdav backend:

    rclone --webdav-unix-socket /tmp/my.socket --webdav-url http://localhost lsf :webdav:

Note that there is no authentication on http protocol - this is expected to be
done by the permissions on the socket.

## Server options

Use `--addr` to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg `--addr 1.2.3.4:8000` or `--addr :8080` to listen to all
IPs.  By default it only listens on localhost.  You can use port
:0 to let the OS choose an available port.

If you set `--addr` to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

You can use a unix socket by setting the url to `unix:///path/to/socket`
or just by using an absolute path name. Note that unix sockets bypass the
authentication - this is expected to be done with file system permissions.

`--addr` may be repeated to listen on multiple IPs/ports/sockets.
Socket activation, described further below, can also be used to accomplish the same.

`--server-read-timeout` and `--server-write-timeout` can be used to
control the timeouts on the server.  Note that this is the total time
for a transfer.

`--max-header-bytes` controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.

`--baseurl` controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.  By default
rclone will serve from the root.  If you used `--baseurl "/rclone"` then
rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/".  This is
useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.  Rclone automatically
inserts leading and trailing "/" on `--baseurl`, so `--baseurl "rclone"`,
`--baseurl "/rclone"` and `--baseurl "/rclone/"` are all treated
identically.

### TLS (SSL)

By default this will serve over http.  If you want you can serve over
https.  You will need to supply the `--cert` and `--key` flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need to
supply `--client-ca` also.

`--cert` should be a either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation
of that with the CA certificate.  `--key` should be the PEM encoded
private key and `--client-ca` should be the PEM encoded client
certificate authority certificate.

`--min-tls-version` is minimum TLS version that is acceptable. Valid
  values are "tls1.0", "tls1.1", "tls1.2" and "tls1.3" (default
  "tls1.0").

## Socket activation

Instead of the listening addresses specified above, rclone will listen to all
FDs passed by the service manager, if any (and ignore any arguments passed by --addr`).

This allows rclone to be a socket-activated service.
It can be configured with .socket and .service unit files as described in
https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html

Socket activation can be tested ad-hoc with the `systemd-socket-activate`command

       systemd-socket-activate -l 8000 -- rclone serve

This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 8000 over TCP.
### Template

`--template` allows a user to specify a custom markup template for HTTP
and WebDAV serve functions.  The server exports the following markup
to be used within the template to server pages:

| Parameter   | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| .Name       | The full path of a file/directory. |
| .Title      | Directory listing of .Name |
| .Sort       | The current sort used.  This is changeable via ?sort= parameter |
|             | Sort Options: namedirfirst,name,size,time (default namedirfirst) |
| .Order      | The current ordering used.  This is changeable via ?order= parameter |
|             | Order Options: asc,desc (default asc) |
| .Query      | Currently unused. |
| .Breadcrumb | Allows for creating a relative navigation |
|-- .Link     | The relative to the root link of the Text. |
|-- .Text     | The Name of the directory. |
| .Entries    | Information about a specific file/directory. |
|-- .URL      | The 'url' of an entry.  |
|-- .Leaf     | Currently same as 'URL' but intended to be 'just' the name. |
|-- .IsDir    | Boolean for if an entry is a directory or not. |
|-- .Size     | Size in Bytes of the entry. |
|-- .ModTime  | The UTC timestamp of an entry. |

The server also makes the following functions available so that they can be used within the
template. These functions help extend the options for dynamic rendering of HTML. They can
be used to render HTML based on specific conditions.

| Function   | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| afterEpoch  | Returns the time since the epoch for the given time. |
| contains    | Checks whether a given substring is present or not in a given string. |
| hasPrefix   | Checks whether the given string begins with the specified prefix. |
| hasSuffix   | Checks whether the given string end with the specified suffix. |

### Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or
set a single username and password with the `--user` and `--pass` flags.

If no static users are configured by either of the above methods, and client
certificates are required by the `--client-ca` flag passed to the server, the
client certificate common name will be considered as the username.

Use `--htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd` to provide an htpasswd file.  This is
in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic
authentication.  Bcrypt is recommended.

To create an htpasswd file:

    touch htpasswd
    htpasswd -B htpasswd user
    htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser

The password file can be updated while rclone is running.

Use `--realm` to set the authentication realm.

Use `--salt` to change the password hashing salt from the default.

## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` note
that the cache may exceed these quotas for two reasons. Firstly
because it is only checked every `--vfs-cache-poll-interval`. Secondly
because open files cannot be evicted from the cache. When
`--vfs-cache-max-size` or `--vfs-cache-min-free-size` is exceeded,
rclone will attempt to evict the least accessed files from the cache
first. rclone will start with files that haven't been accessed for the
longest. This cache flushing strategy is efficient and more relevant
files are likely to remain cached.

The `--vfs-cache-max-age` will evict files from the cache
after the set time since last access has passed. The default value of
1 hour will start evicting files from cache that haven't been accessed
for 1 hour. When a cached file is accessed the 1 hour timer is reset to 0
and will wait for 1 more hour before evicting. Specify the time with
standard notation, s, m, h, d, w .

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

### Fingerprinting

Various parts of the VFS use fingerprinting to see if a local file
copy has changed relative to a remote file. Fingerprints are made
from:

- size
- modification time
- hash

where available on an object.

On some backends some of these attributes are slow to read (they take
an extra API call per object, or extra work per object).

For example `hash` is slow with the `local` and `sftp` backends as
they have to read the entire file and hash it, and `modtime` is slow
with the `s3`, `swift`, `ftp` and `qinqstor` backends because they
need to do an extra API call to fetch it.

If you use the `--vfs-fast-fingerprint` flag then rclone will not
include the slow operations in the fingerprint. This makes the
fingerprinting less accurate but much faster and will improve the
opening time of cached files.

If you are running a vfs cache over `local`, `s3` or `swift` backends
then using this flag is recommended.

Note that if you change the value of this flag, the fingerprints of
the files in the cache may be invalidated and the files will need to
be downloaded again.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
    --vfs-read-chunk-streams int            The number of parallel streams to read at once

The chunking behaves differently depending on the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` parameter.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` == 0

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

The chunks will not be buffered in memory.

### `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` > 0

Rclone reads `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` chunks of size
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` concurrently. The size for each read will stay
constant.

This improves performance performance massively on high latency links
or very high bandwidth links to high performance object stores.

Some experimentation will be needed to find the optimum values of
`--vfs-read-chunk-size` and `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` as these will
depend on the backend in use and the latency to the backend.

For high performance object stores (eg AWS S3) a reasonable place to
start might be `--vfs-read-chunk-streams 16` and
`--vfs-read-chunk-size 4M`. In testing with AWS S3 the performance
scaled roughly as the `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` setting.

Similar settings should work for high latency links, but depending on
the latency they may need more `--vfs-read-chunk-streams` in order to
get the throughput.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Only allow read-only access.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from the cache (the related global flag `--checkers` has no effect on the VFS).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` VFS flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on the
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by the underlying remote.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

The `--no-unicode-normalization` flag controls whether a similar "fixup" is
performed for filenames that differ but are [canonically
equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence) with respect to
unicode. Unicode normalization can be particularly helpful for users of macOS,
which prefers form NFD instead of the NFC used by most other platforms. It is
therefore highly recommended to keep the default of `false` on macOS, to avoid
encoding compatibility issues.

In the (probably unlikely) event that a directory has multiple duplicate
filenames after applying case and unicode normalization, the `--vfs-block-norm-dupes`
flag allows hiding these duplicates. This comes with a performance tradeoff, as
rclone will have to scan the entire directory for duplicates when listing a
directory. For this reason, it is recommended to leave this disabled if not
needed. However, macOS users may wish to consider using it, as otherwise, if a
remote directory contains both NFC and NFD versions of the same filename, an odd
situation will occur: both versions of the file will be visible in the mount,
and both will appear to be editable, however, editing either version will
actually result in only the NFD version getting edited under the hood. `--vfs-block-
norm-dupes` prevents this confusion by detecting this scenario, hiding the
duplicates, and logging an error, similar to how this is handled in `rclone
sync`.

## VFS Disk Options

This flag allows you to manually set the statistics about the filing system.
It can be useful when those statistics cannot be read correctly automatically.

    --vfs-disk-space-total-size    Manually set the total disk space size (example: 256G, default: -1)

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

## Auth Proxy

If you supply the parameter `--auth-proxy /path/to/program` then
rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which
then are used to authenticate incoming requests.  This uses a simple
JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.

**PLEASE NOTE:** `--auth-proxy` and `--authorized-keys` cannot be used
together, if `--auth-proxy` is set the authorized keys option will be
ignored.

There is an example program
[bin/test_proxy.py](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/bin/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.

The program's job is to take a `user` and `pass` on the input and turn
those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format.  This
config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but it
won't use configuration from environment variables or command line
options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete
config.

This config generated must have this extra parameter
- `_root` - root to use for the backend

And it may have this parameter
- `_obscure` - comma separated strings for parameters to obscure

If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

```
{
	"user": "me",
	"pass": "mypassword"
}
```

If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the
proxy process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

```
{
	"user": "me",
	"public_key": "AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf"
}
```

And as an example return this on STDOUT

```
{
	"type": "sftp",
	"_root": "",
	"_obscure": "pass",
	"user": "me",
	"pass": "mypassword",
	"host": "sftp.example.com"
}
```

This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for
the `user` and `pass`/`public_key` returned in the output to the host given.  Note
that since `_obscure` is set to `pass`, rclone will obscure the `pass`
parameter before creating the backend (which is required for sftp
backends).

The program can manipulate the supplied `user` in any way, for example
to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the
`user` be `user@example.com` and then set the `host` to `example.com`
in the output and the user to `user`. For security you'd probably want
to restrict the `host` to a limited list.

Note that an internal cache is keyed on `user` so only use that for
configuration, don't use `pass` or `public_key`.  This also means that if a user's
password or public-key is changed the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins)
before it takes effect.

This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of
backend that rclone supports.

# rclone settier

Changes storage class/tier of objects in remote.

## Synopsis

Changes storage tier or class at remote if supported. Few cloud storage
services provides different storage classes on objects, for example
AWS S3 and Glacier, Azure Blob storage - Hot, Cool and Archive,
Google Cloud Storage, Regional Storage, Nearline, Coldline etc.

Note that, certain tier changes make objects not available to access immediately.
For example tiering to archive in azure blob storage makes objects in frozen state,
user can restore by setting tier to Hot/Cool, similarly S3 to Glacier makes object
inaccessible.true

You can use it to tier single object

    rclone settier Cool remote:path/file

Or use rclone filters to set tier on only specific files

	rclone --include "*.txt" settier Hot remote:path/dir

Or just provide remote directory and all files in directory will be tiered

    rclone settier tier remote:path/dir

# rclone touch

Create new file or change file modification time.

## Synopsis

Set the modification time on file(s) as specified by remote:path to
have the current time.

If remote:path does not exist then a zero sized file will be created,
unless `--no-create` or `--recursive` is provided.

If `--recursive` is used then recursively sets the modification
time on all existing files that is found under the path. Filters are supported,
and you can test with the `--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.

If `--timestamp` is used then sets the modification time to that
time instead of the current time. Times may be specified as one of:

- 'YYMMDD' - e.g. 17.10.30
- 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS' - e.g. 2006-01-02T15:04:05
- 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSS' - e.g. 2006-01-02T15:04:05.123456789

Note that value of `--timestamp` is in UTC. If you want local time
then add the `--localtime` flag.


```
rclone touch remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help               help for touch
      --localtime          Use localtime for timestamp, not UTC
  -C, --no-create          Do not create the file if it does not exist (implied with --recursive)
  -R, --recursive          Recursively touch all files
  -t, --timestamp string   Use specified time instead of the current time of day
```

# rclone tree

List the contents of the remote in a tree like fashion.

## Synopsis

Lists the contents of a remote in a similar way to the unix tree command.

For example

    $ rclone tree remote:path
    /
    ├── file1
    ├── file2
    ├── file3
    └── subdir
        ├── file4
        └── file5

    1 directories, 5 files

You can use any of the filtering options with the tree command (e.g.
`--include` and `--exclude`.  You can also use `--fast-list`.

The tree command has many options for controlling the listing which
are compatible with the tree command, for example you can include file
sizes with `--size`.  Note that not all of them have
short options as they conflict with rclone's short options.

For a more interactive navigation of the remote see the
[ncdu](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_ncdu/) command.

Copying single files
--------------------

rclone normally syncs or copies directories.  However, if the source
remote points to a file, rclone will just copy that file.  The
destination remote must point to a directory - rclone will give the
error `Failed to create file system for "remote:file": is a file not a
directory` if it isn't.

For example, suppose you have a remote with a file in called
`test.jpg`, then you could copy just that file like this

    rclone copy remote:test.jpg /tmp/download

The file `test.jpg` will be placed inside `/tmp/download`.

This is equivalent to specifying

    rclone copy --files-from /tmp/files remote: /tmp/download

Where `/tmp/files` contains the single line

    test.jpg

It is recommended to use `copy` when copying individual files, not `sync`.
They have pretty much the same effect but `copy` will use a lot less
memory.

Syntax of remote paths
----------------------

The syntax of the paths passed to the rclone command are as follows.

### /path/to/dir

This refers to the local file system.

On Windows `\` may be used instead of `/` in local paths **only**,
non local paths must use `/`. See [local filesystem](https://rclone.org/local/#paths-on-windows)
documentation for more about Windows-specific paths.

These paths needn't start with a leading `/` - if they don't then they
will be relative to the current directory.

### remote:path/to/dir

This refers to a directory `path/to/dir` on `remote:` as defined in
the config file (configured with `rclone config`).

### remote:/path/to/dir

On most backends this is refers to the same directory as
`remote:path/to/dir` and that format should be preferred.  On a very
small number of remotes (FTP, SFTP, Dropbox for business) this will
refer to a different directory.  On these, paths without a leading `/`
will refer to your "home" directory and paths with a leading `/` will
refer to the root.

### :backend:path/to/dir

This is an advanced form for creating remotes on the fly.  `backend`
should be the name or prefix of a backend (the `type` in the config
file) and all the configuration for the backend should be provided on
the command line (or in environment variables).

Here are some examples:

    rclone lsd --http-url https://pub.rclone.org :http:

To list all the directories in the root of `https://pub.rclone.org/`.

    rclone lsf --http-url https://example.com :http:path/to/dir

To list files and directories in `https://example.com/path/to/dir/`

    rclone copy --http-url https://example.com :http:path/to/dir /tmp/dir

To copy files and directories in `https://example.com/path/to/dir` to `/tmp/dir`.

    rclone copy --sftp-host example.com :sftp:path/to/dir /tmp/dir

To copy files and directories from `example.com` in the relative
directory `path/to/dir` to `/tmp/dir` using sftp.

### Connection strings {#connection-strings}

The above examples can also be written using a connection string
syntax, so instead of providing the arguments as command line
parameters `--http-url https://pub.rclone.org` they are provided as
part of the remote specification as a kind of connection string.

    rclone lsd ":http,url='https://pub.rclone.org':"
    rclone lsf ":http,url='https://example.com':path/to/dir"
    rclone copy ":http,url='https://example.com':path/to/dir" /tmp/dir
    rclone copy :sftp,host=example.com:path/to/dir /tmp/dir

These can apply to modify existing remotes as well as create new
remotes with the on the fly syntax. This example is equivalent to
adding the `--drive-shared-with-me` parameter to the remote `gdrive:`.

    rclone lsf "gdrive,shared_with_me:path/to/dir"

The major advantage to using the connection string style syntax is
that it only applies to the remote, not to all the remotes of that
type of the command line. A common confusion is this attempt to copy a
file shared on google drive to the normal drive which **does not
work** because the `--drive-shared-with-me` flag applies to both the
source and the destination.

    rclone copy --drive-shared-with-me gdrive:shared-file.txt gdrive:

However using the connection string syntax, this does work.

    rclone copy "gdrive,shared_with_me:shared-file.txt" gdrive:

Note that the connection string only affects the options of the immediate 
backend. If for example gdriveCrypt is a crypt based on gdrive, then the 
following command **will not work** as intended, because 
`shared_with_me` is ignored by the crypt backend:

    rclone copy "gdriveCrypt,shared_with_me:shared-file.txt" gdriveCrypt:

The connection strings have the following syntax

    remote,parameter=value,parameter2=value2:path/to/dir
    :backend,parameter=value,parameter2=value2:path/to/dir

If the `parameter` has a `:` or `,` then it must be placed in quotes `"` or
`'`, so

    remote,parameter="colon:value",parameter2="comma,value":path/to/dir
    :backend,parameter='colon:value',parameter2='comma,value':path/to/dir

If a quoted value needs to include that quote, then it should be
doubled, so

    remote,parameter="with""quote",parameter2='with''quote':path/to/dir

This will make `parameter` be `with"quote` and `parameter2` be
`with'quote`.

If you leave off the `=parameter` then rclone will substitute `=true`
which works very well with flags. For example, to use s3 configured in
the environment you could use:

    rclone lsd :s3,env_auth:

Which is equivalent to

    rclone lsd :s3,env_auth=true:

Note that on the command line you might need to surround these
connection strings with `"` or `'` to stop the shell interpreting any
special characters within them.

If you are a shell master then you'll know which strings are OK and
which aren't, but if you aren't sure then enclose them in `"` and use
`'` as the inside quote. This syntax works on all OSes.

    rclone copy ":http,url='https://example.com':path/to/dir" /tmp/dir

On Linux/macOS some characters are still interpreted inside `"`
strings in the shell (notably `\` and `$` and `"`) so if your strings
contain those you can swap the roles of `"` and `'` thus. (This syntax
does not work on Windows.)

    rclone copy ':http,url="https://example.com":path/to/dir' /tmp/dir

#### Connection strings, config and logging

If you supply extra configuration to a backend by command line flag,
environment variable or connection string then rclone will add a
suffix based on the hash of the config to the name of the remote, eg

    rclone -vv lsf --s3-chunk-size 20M s3:

Has the log message

    DEBUG : s3: detected overridden config - adding "{Srj1p}" suffix to name

This is so rclone can tell the modified remote apart from the
unmodified remote when caching the backends.

This should only be noticeable in the logs.

This means that on the fly backends such as

    rclone -vv lsf :s3,env_auth:

Will get their own names

    DEBUG : :s3: detected overridden config - adding "{YTu53}" suffix to name

### Valid remote names

Remote names are case sensitive, and must adhere to the following rules:
 - May contain number, letter, `_`, `-`, `.`, `+`, `@` and space.
 - May not start with `-` or space.
 - May not end with space.

Starting with rclone version 1.61, any Unicode numbers and letters are allowed,
while in older versions it was limited to plain ASCII (0-9, A-Z, a-z). If you use
the same rclone configuration from different shells, which may be configured with
different character encoding, you must be cautious to use characters that are
possible to write in all of them. This is mostly a problem on Windows, where
the console traditionally uses a non-Unicode character set - defined
by the so-called "code page".

Do not use single character names on Windows as it creates ambiguity with Windows
drives' names, e.g.: remote called `C` is indistinguishable from `C` drive. Rclone
will always assume that single letter name refers to a drive.

Quoting and the shell
---------------------

When you are typing commands to your computer you are using something
called the command line shell.  This interprets various characters in
an OS specific way.

Here are some gotchas which may help users unfamiliar with the shell rules

### Linux / OSX ###

If your names have spaces or shell metacharacters (e.g. `*`, `?`, `$`,
`'`, `"`, etc.) then you must quote them.  Use single quotes `'` by default.

    rclone copy 'Important files?' remote:backup

If you want to send a `'` you will need to use `"`, e.g.

    rclone copy "O'Reilly Reviews" remote:backup

The rules for quoting metacharacters are complicated and if you want
the full details you'll have to consult the manual page for your
shell.

### Windows ###

If your names have spaces in you need to put them in `"`, e.g.

    rclone copy "E:\folder name\folder name\folder name" remote:backup

If you are using the root directory on its own then don't quote it
(see [#464](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/464) for why), e.g.

    rclone copy E:\ remote:backup

Copying files or directories with `:` in the names
--------------------------------------------------

rclone uses `:` to mark a remote name.  This is, however, a valid
filename component in non-Windows OSes.  The remote name parser will
only search for a `:` up to the first `/` so if you need to act on a
file or directory like this then use the full path starting with a
`/`, or use `./` as a current directory prefix.

So to sync a directory called `sync:me` to a remote called `remote:` use

    rclone sync --interactive ./sync:me remote:path

or

    rclone sync --interactive /full/path/to/sync:me remote:path

Server Side Copy
----------------

Most remotes (but not all - see [the
overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)) support server-side copy.

This means if you want to copy one folder to another then rclone won't
download all the files and re-upload them; it will instruct the server
to copy them in place.

Eg

    rclone copy s3:oldbucket s3:newbucket

Will copy the contents of `oldbucket` to `newbucket` without
downloading and re-uploading.

Remotes which don't support server-side copy **will** download and
re-upload in this case.

Server side copies are used with `sync` and `copy` and will be
identified in the log when using the `-v` flag.  The `move` command
may also use them if remote doesn't support server-side move directly.
This is done by issuing a server-side copy then a delete which is much
quicker than a download and re-upload.

Server side copies will only be attempted if the remote names are the
same.

This can be used when scripting to make aged backups efficiently, e.g.

    rclone sync --interactive remote:current-backup remote:previous-backup
    rclone sync --interactive /path/to/files remote:current-backup

## Metadata support {#metadata}

Metadata is data about a file (or directory) which isn't the contents
of the file (or directory). Normally rclone only preserves the
modification time and the content (MIME) type where possible.

Rclone supports preserving all the available metadata on files and
directories when using the `--metadata` or `-M` flag.

Exactly what metadata is supported and what that support means depends
on the backend. Backends that support metadata have a metadata section
in their docs and are listed in the [features table](https://rclone.org/overview/#features)
(Eg [local](https://rclone.org/local/#metadata), [s3](/s3/#metadata))

Some backends don't support metadata, some only support metadata on
files and some support metadata on both files and directories.

Rclone only supports a one-time sync of metadata. This means that
metadata will be synced from the source object to the destination
object only when the source object has changed and needs to be
re-uploaded. If the metadata subsequently changes on the source object
without changing the object itself then it won't be synced to the
destination object. This is in line with the way rclone syncs
`Content-Type` without the `--metadata` flag.

Using `--metadata` when syncing from local to local will preserve file
attributes such as file mode, owner, extended attributes (not
Windows).

Note that arbitrary metadata may be added to objects using the
`--metadata-set key=value` flag when the object is first uploaded.
This flag can be repeated as many times as necessary.

The [--metadata-mapper](#metadata-mapper) flag can be used to pass the
name of a program in which can transform metadata when it is being
copied from source to destination.

Rclone supports `--metadata-set` and `--metadata-mapper` when doing
sever side `Move` and server side `Copy`, but not when doing server
side `DirMove` (renaming a directory) as this would involve recursing
into the directory. Note that you can disable `DirMove` with
`--disable DirMove` and rclone will revert back to using `Move` for
each individual object where `--metadata-set` and `--metadata-mapper`
are supported.

### Types of metadata

Metadata is divided into two type. System metadata and User metadata.

Metadata which the backend uses itself is called system metadata. For
example on the local backend the system metadata `uid` will store the
user ID of the file when used on a unix based platform.

Arbitrary metadata is called user metadata and this can be set however
is desired.

When objects are copied from backend to backend, they will attempt to
interpret system metadata if it is supplied. Metadata may change from
being user metadata to system metadata as objects are copied between
different backends. For example copying an object from s3 sets the
`content-type` metadata. In a backend which understands this (like
`azureblob`) this will become the Content-Type of the object. In a
backend which doesn't understand this (like the `local` backend) this
will become user metadata. However should the local object be copied
back to s3, the Content-Type will be set correctly.

### Metadata framework

Rclone implements a metadata framework which can read metadata from an
object and write it to the object when (and only when) it is being
uploaded.

This metadata is stored as a dictionary with string keys and string
values.

There are some limits on the names of the keys (these may be clarified
further in the future).

- must be lower case
- may be `a-z` `0-9` containing `.` `-` or `_`
- length is backend dependent

Each backend can provide system metadata that it understands. Some
backends can also store arbitrary user metadata.

Where possible the key names are standardized, so, for example, it is
possible to copy object metadata from s3 to azureblob for example and
metadata will be translated appropriately.

Some backends have limits on the size of the metadata and rclone will
give errors on upload if they are exceeded.

### Metadata preservation

The goal of the implementation is to

1. Preserve metadata if at all possible
2. Interpret metadata if at all possible

The consequences of 1 is that you can copy an S3 object to a local
disk then back to S3 losslessly. Likewise you can copy a local file
with file attributes and xattrs from local disk to s3 and back again
losslessly.

The consequence of 2 is that you can copy an S3 object with metadata
to Azureblob (say) and have the metadata appear on the Azureblob
object also.

### Standard system metadata

Here is a table of standard system metadata which, if appropriate, a
backend may implement.

| key                 | description | example |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| mode                | File type and mode: octal, unix style | 0100664 |
| uid                 | User ID of owner: decimal number | 500 |
| gid                 | Group ID of owner: decimal number | 500 |
| rdev                | Device ID (if special file)  => hexadecimal | 0 |
| atime               | Time of last access:  RFC 3339 | 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00 |
| mtime               | Time of last modification:  RFC 3339 | 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00 |
| btime               | Time of file creation (birth):  RFC 3339 | 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00 |
| utime               | Time of file upload:  RFC 3339 | 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00 |
| cache-control       | Cache-Control header | no-cache |
| content-disposition | Content-Disposition header | inline |
| content-encoding    | Content-Encoding header | gzip |
| content-language    | Content-Language header | en-US |
| content-type        | Content-Type header | text/plain |

The metadata keys `mtime` and `content-type` will take precedence if
supplied in the metadata over reading the `Content-Type` or
modification time of the source object.

Hashes are not included in system metadata as there is a well defined
way of reading those already.

Options
-------

Rclone has a number of options to control its behaviour.

Options that take parameters can have the values passed in two ways,
`--option=value` or `--option value`. However boolean (true/false)
options behave slightly differently to the other options in that
`--boolean` sets the option to `true` and the absence of the flag sets
it to `false`.  It is also possible to specify `--boolean=false` or
`--boolean=true`.  Note that `--boolean false` is not valid - this is
parsed as `--boolean` and the `false` is parsed as an extra command
line argument for rclone.

### Time or duration options {#time-option}

TIME or DURATION options can be specified as a duration string or a
time string.

A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers,
each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms",
"-1.5h" or "2h45m". Default units are seconds or the following
abbreviations are valid:

  * `ms` - Milliseconds
  * `s`  - Seconds
  * `m`  - Minutes
  * `h`  - Hours
  * `d`  - Days
  * `w`  - Weeks
  * `M`  - Months
  * `y`  - Years

These can also be specified as an absolute time in the following
formats:

- RFC3339 - e.g. `2006-01-02T15:04:05Z` or `2006-01-02T15:04:05+07:00`
- ISO8601 Date and time, local timezone - `2006-01-02T15:04:05`
- ISO8601 Date and time, local timezone - `2006-01-02 15:04:05`
- ISO8601 Date - `2006-01-02` (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Size options {#size-option}

Options which use SIZE use KiB (multiples of 1024 bytes) by default.
However, a suffix of `B` for Byte, `K` for KiB, `M` for MiB,
`G` for GiB, `T` for TiB and `P` for PiB may be used. These are
the binary units, e.g. 1, 2\*\*10, 2\*\*20, 2\*\*30 respectively.

### --backup-dir=DIR ###

When using `sync`, `copy` or `move` any files which would have been
overwritten or deleted are moved in their original hierarchy into this
directory.

If `--suffix` is set, then the moved files will have the suffix added
to them.  If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has
been added) in DIR, then it will be overwritten.

The remote in use must support server-side move or copy and you must
use the same remote as the destination of the sync.  The backup
directory must not overlap the destination directory without it being
excluded by a filter rule.

For example

    rclone sync --interactive /path/to/local remote:current --backup-dir remote:old

will sync `/path/to/local` to `remote:current`, but for any files
which would have been updated or deleted will be stored in
`remote:old`.

If running rclone from a script you might want to use today's date as
the directory name passed to `--backup-dir` to store the old files, or
you might want to pass `--suffix` with today's date.

See `--compare-dest` and `--copy-dest`.

### --bind string ###

Local address to bind to for outgoing connections.  This can be an
IPv4 address (1.2.3.4), an IPv6 address (1234::789A) or host name.  If
the host name doesn't resolve or resolves to more than one IP address
it will give an error.

You can use `--bind 0.0.0.0` to force rclone to use IPv4 addresses and
`--bind ::0` to force rclone to use IPv6 addresses.

### --bwlimit=BANDWIDTH_SPEC ###

This option controls the bandwidth limit. For example

    --bwlimit 10M

would mean limit the upload and download bandwidth to 10 MiB/s.
**NB** this is **bytes** per second not **bits** per second. To use a
single limit, specify the desired bandwidth in KiB/s, or use a
suffix B|K|M|G|T|P. The default is `0` which means to not limit bandwidth.

The upload and download bandwidth can be specified separately, as
`--bwlimit UP:DOWN`, so

    --bwlimit 10M:100k

would mean limit the upload bandwidth to 10 MiB/s and the download
bandwidth to 100 KiB/s. Either limit can be "off" meaning no limit, so
to just limit the upload bandwidth you would use

    --bwlimit 10M:off

this would limit the upload bandwidth to 10 MiB/s but the download
bandwidth would be unlimited.

When specified as above the bandwidth limits last for the duration of
run of the rclone binary.

It is also possible to specify a "timetable" of limits, which will
cause certain limits to be applied at certain times. To specify a
timetable, format your entries as `WEEKDAY-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH
WEEKDAY-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH...` where: `WEEKDAY` is optional element.

- `BANDWIDTH` can be a single number, e.g.`100k` or a pair of numbers
for upload:download, e.g.`10M:1M`.
- `WEEKDAY` can be written as the whole word or only using the first 3
  characters. It is optional.
- `HH:MM` is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.

Entries can be separated by spaces or semicolons.

**Note:** Semicolons can be used as separators instead of spaces to avoid parsing issues in environments like Docker.

An example of a typical timetable to avoid link saturation during daytime
working hours could be:

Using spaces as separators:
`--bwlimit "08:00,512k 12:00,10M 13:00,512k 18:00,30M 23:00,off"`

Using semicolons as separators:
`--bwlimit "08:00,512k;12:00,10M;13:00,512k;18:00,30M;23:00,off"`

In these examples, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512 KiB/s
at 8am every day. At noon, it will rise to 10 MiB/s, and drop back
to 512 KiB/sec at 1pm. At 6pm, the bandwidth limit will be set to
30 MiB/s, and at 11pm it will be completely disabled (full speed).
Anything between 11pm and 8am will remain unlimited.

An example of timetable with `WEEKDAY` could be:

Using spaces as separators:
`--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512 Fri-23:59,10M Sat-10:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"`

Using semicolons as separators:
`--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512;Fri-23:59,10M;Sat-10:00,1M;Sun-20:00,off"`

It means that, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512 KiB/s on
Monday. It will rise to 10 MiB/s before the end of Friday. At 10:00
on Saturday it will be set to 1 MiB/s. From 20:00 on Sunday it will
be unlimited.

Timeslots without `WEEKDAY` are extended to the whole week. So this
example:

`--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512 12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"`

Is equivalent to this:

`--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512Mon-12:00,1M Tue-12:00,1M Wed-12:00,1M Thu-12:00,1M Fri-12:00,1M Sat-12:00,1M Sun-12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"`

Bandwidth limit apply to the data transfer for all backends. For most
backends the directory listing bandwidth is also included (exceptions
being the non HTTP backends, `ftp`, `sftp` and `storj`).

Note that the units are **Byte/s**, not **bit/s**. Typically
connections are measured in bit/s - to convert divide by 8. For
example, let's say you have a 10 Mbit/s connection and you wish rclone
to use half of it - 5 Mbit/s. This is 5/8 = 0.625 MiB/s so you would
use a `--bwlimit 0.625M` parameter for rclone.

On Unix systems (Linux, macOS, …) the bandwidth limiter can be toggled by
sending a `SIGUSR2` signal to rclone. This allows to remove the limitations
of a long running rclone transfer and to restore it back to the value specified
with `--bwlimit` quickly when needed. Assuming there is only one rclone instance
running, you can toggle the limiter like this:

    kill -SIGUSR2 $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
change the bwlimit dynamically:

    rclone rc core/bwlimit rate=1M

### --bwlimit-file=BANDWIDTH_SPEC ###

This option controls per file bandwidth limit. For the options see the
`--bwlimit` flag.

For example use this to allow no transfers to be faster than 1 MiB/s

    --bwlimit-file 1M

This can be used in conjunction with `--bwlimit`.

Note that if a schedule is provided the file will use the schedule in
effect at the start of the transfer.

### --buffer-size=SIZE ###

Use this sized buffer to speed up file transfers.  Each `--transfer`
will use this much memory for buffering.

When using `mount` or `cmount` each open file descriptor will use this much
memory for buffering.
See the [mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#file-buffering) documentation for more details.

Set to `0` to disable the buffering for the minimum memory usage.

Note that the memory allocation of the buffers is influenced by the
[--use-mmap](#use-mmap) flag.

### --cache-dir=DIR ###

Specify the directory rclone will use for caching, to override
the default.

Default value is depending on operating system:
- Windows `%LocalAppData%\rclone`, if `LocalAppData` is defined.
- macOS `$HOME/Library/Caches/rclone` if `HOME` is defined.
- Unix `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/rclone` if `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is defined, else `$HOME/.cache/rclone` if `HOME` is defined.
- Fallback (on all OS) to `$TMPDIR/rclone`, where `TMPDIR` is the value from [--temp-dir](#temp-dir-dir).

You can use the [config paths](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_paths/)
command to see the current value.

Cache directory is heavily used by the [VFS File Caching](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#vfs-file-caching)
mount feature, but also by [serve](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/), [GUI](/gui) and other parts of rclone.

### --check-first ###

If this flag is set then in a `sync`, `copy` or `move`, rclone will do
all the checks to see whether files need to be transferred before
doing any of the transfers. Normally rclone would start running
transfers as soon as possible.

This flag can be useful on IO limited systems where transfers
interfere with checking.

It can also be useful to ensure perfect ordering when using
`--order-by`.

If both `--check-first` and `--order-by` are set when doing `rclone move`
then rclone will use the transfer thread to delete source files which
don't need transferring. This will enable perfect ordering of the
transfers and deletes but will cause the transfer stats to have more
items in than expected.

Using this flag can use more memory as it effectively sets
`--max-backlog` to infinite. This means that all the info on the
objects to transfer is held in memory before the transfers start.

### --checkers=N ###

Originally controlling just the number of file checkers to run in parallel, 
e.g. by `rclone copy`. Now a fairly universal parallelism control 
used by `rclone` in several places. 

Note: checkers do the equality checking of files during a sync. 
For some storage systems (e.g. S3, Swift, Dropbox) this can take 
a significant amount of time so they are run in parallel.

The default is to run 8 checkers in parallel. However, in case 
of slow-reacting backends you may need to lower (rather than increase)
this default by setting `--checkers` to 4 or less threads. This is 
especially advised if you are experiencing backend server crashes 
during file checking phase (e.g. on subsequent or top-up backups 
where little or no file copying is done and checking takes up 
most of the time). Increase this setting only with utmost care, 
while monitoring your server health and file checking throughput.

### -c, --checksum ###

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to
see if they are equal.  If you set this flag then rclone will check
the file hash and size to determine if files are equal.

This is useful when the remote doesn't support setting modified time
and a more accurate sync is desired than just checking the file size.

This is very useful when transferring between remotes which store the
same hash type on the object, e.g. Drive and Swift. For details of which
remotes support which hash type see the table in the [overview
section](https://rclone.org/overview/).

Eg `rclone --checksum sync s3:/bucket swift:/bucket` would run much
quicker than without the `--checksum` flag.

When using this flag, rclone won't update mtimes of remote files if
they are incorrect as it would normally.

### --color WHEN ###

Specify when colors (and other ANSI codes) should be added to the output.

`AUTO` (default) only allows ANSI codes when the output is a terminal

`NEVER` never allow ANSI codes

`ALWAYS` always add ANSI codes, regardless of the output format (terminal or file)

### --compare-dest=DIR ###

When using `sync`, `copy` or `move` DIR is checked in addition to the
destination for files. If a file identical to the source is found that
file is NOT copied from source. This is useful to copy just files that
have changed since the last backup.

You must use the same remote as the destination of the sync.  The
compare directory must not overlap the destination directory.

See `--copy-dest` and `--backup-dir`.

### --config=CONFIG_FILE ###

Specify the location of the rclone configuration file, to override
the default. E.g. `rclone config --config="rclone.conf"`.

The exact default is a bit complex to describe, due to changes
introduced through different versions of rclone while preserving
backwards compatibility, but in most cases it is as simple as:

 - `%APPDATA%/rclone/rclone.conf` on Windows
 - `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf` on other

The complete logic is as follows: Rclone will look for an existing
configuration file in any of the following locations, in priority order:

  1. `rclone.conf` (in program directory, where rclone executable is)
  2. `%APPDATA%/rclone/rclone.conf` (only on Windows)
  3. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rclone/rclone.conf` (on all systems, including Windows)
  4. `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf` (see below for explanation of ~ symbol)
  5. `~/.rclone.conf`

If no existing configuration file is found, then a new one will be created
in the following location:

- On Windows: Location 2 listed above, except in the unlikely event
  that `APPDATA` is not defined, then location 4 is used instead.
- On Unix: Location 3 if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is defined, else location 4.
- Fallback to location 5 (on all OS), when the rclone directory cannot be
  created, but if also a home directory was not found then path
  `.rclone.conf` relative to current working directory will be used as
  a final resort.

The `~` symbol in paths above represent the home directory of the current user
on any OS, and the value is defined as following:

  - On Windows: `%HOME%` if defined, else `%USERPROFILE%`, or else `%HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%`.
  - On Unix: `$HOME` if defined, else by looking up current user in OS-specific user database
    (e.g. passwd file), or else use the result from shell command `cd && pwd`.

If you run `rclone config file` you will see where the default
location is for you.

The fact that an existing file `rclone.conf` in the same directory
as the rclone executable is always preferred, means that it is easy
to run in "portable" mode by downloading rclone executable to a
writable directory and then create an empty file `rclone.conf` in the
same directory.

If the location is set to empty string `""` or path to a file
with name `notfound`, or the os null device represented by value `NUL` on
Windows and `/dev/null` on Unix systems, then rclone will keep the
config file in memory only.

The file format is basic [INI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file#Format):
Sections of text, led by a `[section]` header and followed by
`key=value` entries on separate lines. In rclone each remote is
represented by its own section, where the section name defines the
name of the remote. Options are specified as the `key=value` entries,
where the key is the option name without the `--backend-` prefix,
in lowercase and with `_` instead of `-`. E.g. option `--mega-hard-delete`
corresponds to key `hard_delete`. Only backend options can be specified.
A special, and required, key `type` identifies the [storage system](https://rclone.org/overview/),
where the value is the internal lowercase name as returned by command
`rclone help backends`. Comments are indicated by `;` or `#` at the
beginning of a line.

Example:

    [megaremote]
    type = mega
    user = you@example.com
    pass = PDPcQVVjVtzFY-GTdDFozqBhTdsPg3qH

Note that passwords are in [obscured](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/)
form. Also, many storage systems uses token-based authentication instead
of passwords, and this requires additional steps. It is easier, and safer,
to use the interactive command `rclone config` instead of manually
editing the configuration file.

The configuration file will typically contain login information, and
should therefore have restricted permissions so that only the current user
can read it. Rclone tries to ensure this when it writes the file.
You may also choose to [encrypt](#configuration-encryption) the file.

When token-based authentication are used, the configuration file
must be writable, because rclone needs to update the tokens inside it.

To reduce risk of corrupting an existing configuration file, rclone
will not write directly to it when saving changes. Instead it will
first write to a new, temporary, file. If a configuration file already
existed, it will (on Unix systems) try to mirror its permissions to
the new file. Then it will rename the existing file to a temporary
name as backup. Next, rclone will rename the new file to the correct name,
before finally cleaning up by deleting the backup file.

If the configuration file path used by rclone is a symbolic link, then
this will be evaluated and rclone will write to the resolved path, instead
of overwriting the symbolic link. Temporary files used in the process
(described above) will be written to the same parent directory as that
of the resolved configuration file, but if this directory is also a
symbolic link it will not be resolved and the temporary files will be
written to the location of the directory symbolic link.

### --contimeout=TIME ###

Set the connection timeout. This should be in go time format which
looks like `5s` for 5 seconds, `10m` for 10 minutes, or `3h30m`.

The connection timeout is the amount of time rclone will wait for a
connection to go through to a remote object storage system.  It is
`1m` by default.

### --copy-dest=DIR ###

When using `sync`, `copy` or `move` DIR is checked in addition to the
destination for files. If a file identical to the source is found that
file is server-side copied from DIR to the destination. This is useful
for incremental backup.

The remote in use must support server-side copy and you must
use the same remote as the destination of the sync.  The compare
directory must not overlap the destination directory.

See `--compare-dest` and `--backup-dir`.

### --dedupe-mode MODE ###

Mode to run dedupe command in.  One of `interactive`, `skip`, `first`, 
`newest`, `oldest`, `rename`.  The default is `interactive`.  
See the dedupe command for more information as to what these options mean.

### --default-time TIME ###

If a file or directory does have a modification time rclone can read
then rclone will display this fixed time instead.

The default is `2000-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`. This can be configured in
any of the ways shown in [the time or duration options](#time-option).

For example `--default-time 2020-06-01` to set the default time to the
1st of June 2020 or `--default-time 0s` to set the default time to the
time rclone started up.

### --disable FEATURE,FEATURE,... ###

This disables a comma separated list of optional features. For example
to disable server-side move and server-side copy use:

    --disable move,copy

The features can be put in any case.

To see a list of which features can be disabled use:

    --disable help

The features a remote has can be seen in JSON format with:

    rclone backend features remote:

See the overview [features](https://rclone.org/overview/#features) and
[optional features](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) to get an idea of
which feature does what.

Note that some features can be set to `true` if they are `true`/`false`
feature flag features by prefixing them with `!`. For example the
`CaseInsensitive` feature can be forced to `false` with `--disable CaseInsensitive`
and forced to `true` with `--disable '!CaseInsensitive'`. In general
it isn't a good idea doing this but it may be useful in extremis.

(Note that `!` is a shell command which you will
need to escape with single quotes or a backslash on unix like
platforms.)

This flag can be useful for debugging and in exceptional circumstances
(e.g. Google Drive limiting the total volume of Server Side Copies to
100 GiB/day).

### --disable-http2

This stops rclone from trying to use HTTP/2 if available. This can
sometimes speed up transfers due to a
[problem in the Go standard library](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37373).

### --dscp VALUE ###

Specify a DSCP value or name to use in connections. This could help QoS
system to identify traffic class. BE, EF, DF, LE, CSx and AFxx are allowed.

See the description of [differentiated services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_services) to get an idea of
this field. Setting this to 1 (LE) to identify the flow to SCAVENGER class
can avoid occupying too much bandwidth in a network with DiffServ support ([RFC 8622](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8622)).

For example, if you configured QoS on router to handle LE properly. Running:
```
rclone copy --dscp LE from:/from to:/to
```
would make the priority lower than usual internet flows.

This option has no effect on Windows (see [golang/go#42728](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42728)).

### -n, --dry-run ###

Do a trial run with no permanent changes.  Use this to see what rclone
would do without actually doing it.  Useful when setting up the `sync`
command which deletes files in the destination.

### --expect-continue-timeout=TIME ###

This specifies the amount of time to wait for a server's first
response headers after fully writing the request headers if the
request has an "Expect: 100-continue" header. Not all backends support
using this.

Zero means no timeout and causes the body to be sent immediately,
without waiting for the server to approve.  This time does not include
the time to send the request header.

The default is `1s`.  Set to `0` to disable.

### --error-on-no-transfer ###

By default, rclone will exit with return code 0 if there were no errors.

This option allows rclone to return exit code 9 if no files were transferred
between the source and destination. This allows using rclone in scripts, and
triggering follow-on actions if data was copied, or skipping if not.

NB: Enabling this option turns a usually non-fatal error into a potentially
fatal one - please check and adjust your scripts accordingly!

### --fix-case ###

Normally, a sync to a case insensitive dest (such as macOS / Windows) will
not result in a matching filename if the source and dest filenames have
casing differences but are otherwise identical. For example, syncing `hello.txt`
to `HELLO.txt` will normally result in the dest filename remaining `HELLO.txt`.
If `--fix-case` is set, then `HELLO.txt` will be renamed to `hello.txt`
to match the source.

NB:
- directory names with incorrect casing will also be fixed
- `--fix-case` will be ignored if `--immutable` is set
- using `--local-case-sensitive` instead is not advisable;
it will cause `HELLO.txt` to get deleted!
- the old dest filename must not be excluded by filters.
Be especially careful with [`--files-from`](https://rclone.org/filtering/#files-from-read-list-of-source-file-names),
which does not respect [`--ignore-case`](https://rclone.org/filtering/#ignore-case-make-searches-case-insensitive)!
- on remotes that do not support server-side move, `--fix-case` will require
downloading the file and re-uploading it. To avoid this, do not use `--fix-case`.

### --fs-cache-expire-duration=TIME

When using rclone via the API rclone caches created remotes for 5
minutes by default in the "fs cache". This means that if you do
repeated actions on the same remote then rclone won't have to build it
again from scratch, which makes it more efficient.

This flag sets the time that the remotes are cached for. If you set it
to `0` (or negative) then rclone won't cache the remotes at all.

Note that if you use some flags, eg `--backup-dir` and if this is set
to `0` rclone may build two remotes (one for the source or destination
and one for the `--backup-dir` where it may have only built one
before.

### --fs-cache-expire-interval=TIME

This controls how often rclone checks for cached remotes to expire.
See the `--fs-cache-expire-duration` documentation above for more
info. The default is 60s, set to 0 to disable expiry.

### --header ###

Add an HTTP header for all transactions. The flag can be repeated to
add multiple headers.

If you want to add headers only for uploads use `--header-upload` and
if you want to add headers only for downloads use `--header-download`.

This flag is supported for all HTTP based backends even those not
supported by `--header-upload` and `--header-download` so may be used
as a workaround for those with care.

```
rclone ls remote:test --header "X-Rclone: Foo" --header "X-LetMeIn: Yes"
```

### --header-download ###

Add an HTTP header for all download transactions. The flag can be repeated to
add multiple headers.

```
rclone sync --interactive s3:test/src ~/dst --header-download "X-Amz-Meta-Test: Foo" --header-download "X-Amz-Meta-Test2: Bar"
```

See the GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/59) for
currently supported backends.

### --header-upload ###

Add an HTTP header for all upload transactions. The flag can be repeated to add
multiple headers.

```
rclone sync --interactive ~/src s3:test/dst --header-upload "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename='cool.html'" --header-upload "X-Amz-Meta-Test: FooBar"
```

See the GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/59) for
currently supported backends.

### --human-readable ###

Rclone commands output values for sizes (e.g. number of bytes) and
counts (e.g. number of files) either as *raw* numbers, or
in *human-readable* format.

In human-readable format the values are scaled to larger units, indicated with
a suffix shown after the value, and rounded to three decimals. Rclone consistently
uses binary units (powers of 2) for sizes and decimal units (powers of 10) for counts.
The unit prefix for size is according to IEC standard notation, e.g. `Ki` for kibi.
Used with byte unit, `1 KiB` means 1024 Byte. In list type of output, only the
unit prefix appended to the value (e.g. `9.762Ki`), while in more textual output
the full unit is shown (e.g. `9.762 KiB`). For counts the SI standard notation is
used, e.g. prefix `k` for kilo. Used with file counts, `1k` means 1000 files.

The various [list](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_ls/) commands output raw numbers by default.
Option `--human-readable` will make them output values in human-readable format
instead (with the short unit prefix).

The [about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/) command outputs human-readable by default,
with a command-specific option `--full` to output the raw numbers instead.

Command [size](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_size/) outputs both human-readable and raw numbers
in the same output.

The [tree](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_tree/) command also considers `--human-readable`, but
it will not use the exact same notation as the other commands: It rounds to one
decimal, and uses single letter suffix, e.g. `K` instead of `Ki`. The reason for
this is that it relies on an external library.

The interactive command [ncdu](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_ncdu/) shows human-readable by
default, and responds to key `u` for toggling human-readable format.

### --ignore-case-sync ###

Using this option will cause rclone to ignore the case of the files
when synchronizing so files will not be copied/synced when the
existing filenames are the same, even if the casing is different.

### --ignore-checksum ###

Normally rclone will check that the checksums of transferred files
match, and give an error "corrupted on transfer" if they don't.

You can use this option to skip that check.  You should only use it if
you have had the "corrupted on transfer" error message and you are
sure you might want to transfer potentially corrupted data.

### --ignore-existing ###

Using this option will make rclone unconditionally skip all files
that exist on the destination, no matter the content of these files.

While this isn't a generally recommended option, it can be useful
in cases where your files change due to encryption. However, it cannot
correct partial transfers in case a transfer was interrupted.

When performing a `move`/`moveto` command, this flag will leave skipped
files in the source location unchanged when a file with the same name
exists on the destination.

### --ignore-size ###

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to
see if they are equal.  If you set this flag then rclone will check
only the modification time.  If `--checksum` is set then it only
checks the checksum.

It will also cause rclone to skip verifying the sizes are the same
after transfer.

This can be useful for transferring files to and from OneDrive which
occasionally misreports the size of image files (see
[#399](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/399) for more info).

### -I, --ignore-times ###

Using this option will cause rclone to unconditionally upload all
files regardless of the state of files on the destination.

Normally rclone would skip any files that have the same
modification time and are the same size (or have the same checksum if
using `--checksum`).

### --immutable ###

Treat source and destination files as immutable and disallow
modification.

With this option set, files will be created and deleted as requested,
but existing files will never be updated.  If an existing file does
not match between the source and destination, rclone will give the error
`Source and destination exist but do not match: immutable file modified`.

Note that only commands which transfer files (e.g. `sync`, `copy`,
`move`) are affected by this behavior, and only modification is
disallowed.  Files may still be deleted explicitly (e.g. `delete`,
`purge`) or implicitly (e.g. `sync`, `move`).  Use `copy --immutable`
if it is desired to avoid deletion as well as modification.

This can be useful as an additional layer of protection for immutable
or append-only data sets (notably backup archives), where modification
implies corruption and should not be propagated.

### --inplace {#inplace}

The `--inplace` flag changes the behaviour of rclone when uploading
files to some backends (backends with the `PartialUploads` feature
flag set) such as:

- local
- ftp
- sftp
- pcloud

Without `--inplace` (the default) rclone will first upload to a
temporary file with an extension like this, where `XXXXXX` represents a
hash of the source file's fingerprint and `.partial` is 
[--partial-suffix](#partial-suffix) value (`.partial` by default).

    original-file-name.XXXXXX.partial

(rclone will make sure the final name is no longer than 100 characters
by truncating the `original-file-name` part if necessary).

When the upload is complete, rclone will rename the `.partial` file to
the correct name, overwriting any existing file at that point. If the
upload fails then the `.partial` file will be deleted.

This prevents other users of the backend from seeing partially
uploaded files in their new names and prevents overwriting the old
file until the new one is completely uploaded.

If the `--inplace` flag is supplied, rclone will upload directly to
the final name without creating a `.partial` file.

This means that an incomplete file will be visible in the directory
listings while the upload is in progress and any existing files will
be overwritten as soon as the upload starts. If the transfer fails
then the file will be deleted. This can cause data loss of the
existing file if the transfer fails.

Note that on the local file system if you don't use `--inplace` hard
links (Unix only) will be broken. And if you do use `--inplace` you
won't be able to update in use executables.

Note also that versions of rclone prior to v1.63.0 behave as if the
`--inplace` flag is always supplied.

### -i, --interactive {#interactive}

This flag can be used to tell rclone that you wish a manual
confirmation before destructive operations.

It is **recommended** that you use this flag while learning rclone
especially with `rclone sync`.

For example

```
$ rclone delete --interactive /tmp/dir
rclone: delete "important-file.txt"?
y) Yes, this is OK (default)
n) No, skip this
s) Skip all delete operations with no more questions
!) Do all delete operations with no more questions
q) Exit rclone now.
y/n/s/!/q> n
```

The options mean

- `y`: **Yes**, this operation should go ahead. You can also press Return
  for this to happen. You'll be asked every time unless you choose `s`
  or `!`.
- `n`: **No**, do not do this operation. You'll be asked every time unless
  you choose `s` or `!`.
- `s`: **Skip** all the following operations of this type with no more
  questions. This takes effect until rclone exits. If there are any
  different kind of operations you'll be prompted for them.
- `!`: **Do all** the following operations with no more
  questions. Useful if you've decided that you don't mind rclone doing
  that kind of operation. This takes effect until rclone exits . If
  there are any different kind of operations you'll be prompted for
  them.
- `q`: **Quit** rclone now, just in case!

### --leave-root ####

During rmdirs it will not remove root directory, even if it's empty.

### --log-file=FILE ###

Log all of rclone's output to FILE.  This is not active by default.
This can be useful for tracking down problems with syncs in
combination with the `-v` flag.  See the [Logging section](#logging)
for more info.

If FILE exists then rclone will append to it.

Note that if you are using the `logrotate` program to manage rclone's
logs, then you should use the `copytruncate` option as rclone doesn't
have a signal to rotate logs.

### --log-format LIST ###

Comma separated list of log format options. Accepted options are `date`, 
`time`, `microseconds`, `pid`, `longfile`, `shortfile`, `UTC`. Any other 
keywords will be silently ignored. `pid` will tag log messages with process
identifier which useful with `rclone mount --daemon`. Other accepted
options are explained in the [go documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/log#pkg-constants).
The default log format is "`date`,`time`".

### --log-level LEVEL ###

This sets the log level for rclone.  The default log level is `NOTICE`.

`DEBUG` is equivalent to `-vv`. It outputs lots of debug info - useful
for bug reports and really finding out what rclone is doing.

`INFO` is equivalent to `-v`. It outputs information about each transfer
and prints stats once a minute by default.

`NOTICE` is the default log level if no logging flags are supplied. It
outputs very little when things are working normally. It outputs
warnings and significant events.

`ERROR` is equivalent to `-q`. It only outputs error messages.

### --use-json-log ###

This switches the log format to JSON for rclone. The fields of json log
are level, msg, source, time.

### --low-level-retries NUMBER ###

This controls the number of low level retries rclone does.

A low level retry is used to retry a failing operation - typically one
HTTP request.  This might be uploading a chunk of a big file for
example.  You will see low level retries in the log with the `-v`
flag.

This shouldn't need to be changed from the default in normal operations.
However, if you get a lot of low level retries you may wish
to reduce the value so rclone moves on to a high level retry (see the
`--retries` flag) quicker.

Disable low level retries with `--low-level-retries 1`.

### --max-backlog=N ###

This is the maximum allowable backlog of files in a sync/copy/move
queued for being checked or transferred.

This can be set arbitrarily large.  It will only use memory when the
queue is in use.  Note that it will use in the order of N KiB of memory
when the backlog is in use.

Setting this large allows rclone to calculate how many files are
pending more accurately, give a more accurate estimated finish
time and make `--order-by` work more accurately.

Setting this small will make rclone more synchronous to the listings
of the remote which may be desirable.

Setting this to a negative number will make the backlog as large as
possible.

### --max-delete=N ###

This tells rclone not to delete more than N files.  If that limit is
exceeded then a fatal error will be generated and rclone will stop the
operation in progress.

### --max-delete-size=SIZE ###

Rclone will stop deleting files when the total size of deletions has
reached the size specified. It defaults to off.

If that limit is exceeded then a fatal error will be generated and
rclone will stop the operation in progress.

### --max-depth=N ###

This modifies the recursion depth for all the commands except purge.

So if you do `rclone --max-depth 1 ls remote:path` you will see only
the files in the top level directory.  Using `--max-depth 2` means you
will see all the files in first two directory levels and so on.

For historical reasons the `lsd` command defaults to using a
`--max-depth` of 1 - you can override this with the command line flag.

You can use this command to disable recursion (with `--max-depth 1`).

Note that if you use this with `sync` and `--delete-excluded` the
files not recursed through are considered excluded and will be deleted
on the destination.  Test first with `--dry-run` if you are not sure
what will happen.

### --max-duration=TIME ###

Rclone will stop transferring when it has run for the
duration specified.
Defaults to off.

When the limit is reached all transfers will stop immediately.
Use `--cutoff-mode` to modify this behaviour.

Rclone will exit with exit code 10 if the duration limit is reached.

### --max-transfer=SIZE ###

Rclone will stop transferring when it has reached the size specified.
Defaults to off.

When the limit is reached all transfers will stop immediately.
Use `--cutoff-mode` to modify this behaviour.

Rclone will exit with exit code 8 if the transfer limit is reached.

### --cutoff-mode=hard|soft|cautious ###

This modifies the behavior of `--max-transfer` and `--max-duration`
Defaults to `--cutoff-mode=hard`.

Specifying `--cutoff-mode=hard` will stop transferring immediately
when Rclone reaches the limit.

Specifying `--cutoff-mode=soft` will stop starting new transfers
when Rclone reaches the limit.

Specifying `--cutoff-mode=cautious` will try to prevent Rclone
from reaching the limit. Only applicable for `--max-transfer`

## -M, --metadata

Setting this flag enables rclone to copy the metadata from the source
to the destination. For local backends this is ownership, permissions,
xattr etc. See the [metadata section](#metadata) for more info.

### --metadata-mapper SpaceSepList {#metadata-mapper}

If you supply the parameter `--metadata-mapper /path/to/program` then
rclone will use that program to map metadata from source object to
destination object.

The argument to this flag should be a command with an optional space separated
list of arguments. If one of the arguments has a space in then enclose
it in `"`, if you want a literal `"` in an argument then enclose the
argument in `"` and double the `"`. See [CSV encoding](https://godoc.org/encoding/csv)
for more info.

    --metadata-mapper "python bin/test_metadata_mapper.py"
    --metadata-mapper 'python bin/test_metadata_mapper.py "argument with a space"'
    --metadata-mapper 'python bin/test_metadata_mapper.py "argument with ""two"" quotes"'

This uses a simple JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output
on STDOUT. This will be called for every file and directory copied and
may be called concurrently.

The program's job is to take a metadata blob on the input and turn it
into a metadata blob on the output suitable for the destination
backend.

Input to the program (via STDIN) might look like this. This provides
some context for the `Metadata` which may be important.

- `SrcFs` is the config string for the remote that the object is currently on.
- `SrcFsType` is the name of the source backend.
- `DstFs` is the config string for the remote that the object is being copied to
- `DstFsType` is the name of the destination backend.
- `Remote` is the path of the object relative to the root.
- `Size`, `MimeType`, `ModTime` are attributes of the object.
- `IsDir` is `true` if this is a directory (not yet implemented).
- `ID` is the source `ID` of the object if known.
- `Metadata` is the backend specific metadata as described in the backend docs.

```json
{
    "SrcFs": "gdrive:",
    "SrcFsType": "drive",
    "DstFs": "newdrive:user",
    "DstFsType": "onedrive",
    "Remote": "test.txt",
    "Size": 6,
    "MimeType": "text/plain; charset=utf-8",
    "ModTime": "2022-10-11T17:53:10.286745272+01:00",
    "IsDir": false,
    "ID": "xyz",
    "Metadata": {
        "btime": "2022-10-11T16:53:11Z",
        "content-type": "text/plain; charset=utf-8",
        "mtime": "2022-10-11T17:53:10.286745272+01:00",
        "owner": "user1@domain1.com",
        "permissions": "...",
        "description": "my nice file",
        "starred": "false"
    }
}
```

The program should then modify the input as desired and send it to
STDOUT. The returned `Metadata` field will be used in its entirety for
the destination object. Any other fields will be ignored. Note in this
example we translate user names and permissions and add something to
the description:

```json
{
    "Metadata": {
        "btime": "2022-10-11T16:53:11Z",
        "content-type": "text/plain; charset=utf-8",
        "mtime": "2022-10-11T17:53:10.286745272+01:00",
        "owner": "user1@domain2.com",
        "permissions": "...",
        "description": "my nice file [migrated from domain1]",
        "starred": "false"
    }
}
```

Metadata can be removed here too.

An example python program might look something like this to implement
the above transformations.

```python
import sys, json

i = json.load(sys.stdin)
metadata = i["Metadata"]
# Add tag to description
if "description" in metadata:
    metadata["description"] += " [migrated from domain1]"
else:
    metadata["description"] = "[migrated from domain1]"
# Modify owner
if "owner" in metadata:
    metadata["owner"] = metadata["owner"].replace("domain1.com", "domain2.com")
o = { "Metadata": metadata }
json.dump(o, sys.stdout, indent="\t")
```

You can find this example (slightly expanded) in the rclone source code at
[bin/test_metadata_mapper.py](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/bin/test_metadata_mapper.py).

If you want to see the input to the metadata mapper and the output
returned from it in the log you can use `-vv --dump mapper`.

See the [metadata section](#metadata) for more info.

### --metadata-set key=value

Add metadata `key` = `value` when uploading. This can be repeated as
many times as required. See the [metadata section](#metadata) for more
info.

### --modify-window=TIME ###

When checking whether a file has been modified, this is the maximum
allowed time difference that a file can have and still be considered
equivalent.

The default is `1ns` unless this is overridden by a remote.  For
example OS X only stores modification times to the nearest second so
if you are reading and writing to an OS X filing system this will be
`1s` by default.

This command line flag allows you to override that computed default.

### --multi-thread-write-buffer-size=SIZE ###

When transferring with multiple threads, rclone will buffer SIZE bytes
in memory before writing to disk for each thread.

This can improve performance if the underlying filesystem does not deal
well with a lot of small writes in different positions of the file, so
if you see transfers being limited by disk write speed, you might want
to experiment with different values. Specially for magnetic drives and
remote file systems a higher value can be useful.

Nevertheless, the default of `128k` should be fine for almost all use
cases, so before changing it ensure that network is not really your
bottleneck.

As a final hint, size is not the only factor: block size (or similar
concept) can have an impact. In one case, we observed that exact
multiples of 16k performed much better than other values.

### --multi-thread-chunk-size=SizeSuffix ###

Normally the chunk size for multi thread transfers is set by the backend.
However some backends such as `local` and `smb` (which implement `OpenWriterAt`
but not `OpenChunkWriter`) don't have a natural chunk size.

In this case the value of this option is used (default 64Mi).

### --multi-thread-cutoff=SIZE {#multi-thread-cutoff}

When transferring files above SIZE to capable backends, rclone will
use multiple threads to transfer the file (default 256M).

Capable backends are marked in the
[overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) as `MultithreadUpload`. (They
need to implement either the `OpenWriterAt` or `OpenChunkWriter`
internal interfaces). These include include, `local`, `s3`,
`azureblob`, `b2`, `oracleobjectstorage` and `smb` at the time of
writing.

On the local disk, rclone preallocates the file (using
`fallocate(FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE)` on unix or `NTSetInformationFile` on
Windows both of which takes no time) then each thread writes directly
into the file at the correct place. This means that rclone won't
create fragmented or sparse files and there won't be any assembly time
at the end of the transfer.

The number of threads used to transfer is controlled by
`--multi-thread-streams`.

Use `-vv` if you wish to see info about the threads.

This will work with the `sync`/`copy`/`move` commands and friends
`copyto`/`moveto`. Multi thread transfers will be used with `rclone
mount` and `rclone serve` if `--vfs-cache-mode` is set to `writes` or
above.

**NB** that this **only** works with supported backends as the
destination but will work with any backend as the source.

**NB** that multi-thread copies are disabled for local to local copies
as they are faster without unless `--multi-thread-streams` is set
explicitly.

**NB** on Windows using multi-thread transfers to the local disk will
cause the resulting files to be [sparse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file).
Use `--local-no-sparse` to disable sparse files (which may cause long
delays at the start of transfers) or disable multi-thread transfers
with `--multi-thread-streams 0`

### --multi-thread-streams=N ###

When using multi thread transfers (see above `--multi-thread-cutoff`)
this sets the number of streams to use. Set to `0` to disable multi
thread transfers (Default 4).

If the backend has a `--backend-upload-concurrency` setting (eg
`--s3-upload-concurrency`) then this setting will be used as the
number of transfers instead if it is larger than the value of
`--multi-thread-streams` or `--multi-thread-streams` isn't set.

### --no-check-dest ###

The `--no-check-dest` can be used with `move` or `copy` and it causes
rclone not to check the destination at all when copying files.

This means that:

- the destination is not listed minimising the API calls
- files are always transferred
- this can cause duplicates on remotes which allow it (e.g. Google Drive)
- `--retries 1` is recommended otherwise you'll transfer everything again on a retry

This flag is useful to minimise the transactions if you know that none
of the files are on the destination.

This is a specialized flag which should be ignored by most users!

### --no-gzip-encoding ###

Don't set `Accept-Encoding: gzip`.  This means that rclone won't ask
the server for compressed files automatically. Useful if you've set
the server to return files with `Content-Encoding: gzip` but you
uploaded compressed files.

There is no need to set this in normal operation, and doing so will
decrease the network transfer efficiency of rclone.

### --no-traverse ###

The `--no-traverse` flag controls whether the destination file system
is traversed when using the `copy` or `move` commands.
`--no-traverse` is not compatible with `sync` and will be ignored if
you supply it with `sync`.

If you are only copying a small number of files (or are filtering most
of the files) and/or have a large number of files on the destination
then `--no-traverse` will stop rclone listing the destination and save
time.

However, if you are copying a large number of files, especially if you
are doing a copy where lots of the files under consideration haven't
changed and won't need copying then you shouldn't use `--no-traverse`.

See [rclone copy](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) for an example of how to use it.

### --no-unicode-normalization ###

Don't normalize unicode characters in filenames during the sync routine.

Sometimes, an operating system will store filenames containing unicode
parts in their decomposed form (particularly macOS). Some cloud storage
systems will then recompose the unicode, resulting in duplicate files if
the data is ever copied back to a local filesystem.

Using this flag will disable that functionality, treating each unicode
character as unique. For example, by default é and é will be normalized
into the same character. With `--no-unicode-normalization` they will be
treated as unique characters.

### --no-update-modtime ###

When using this flag, rclone won't update modification times of remote
files if they are incorrect as it would normally.

This can be used if the remote is being synced with another tool also
(e.g. the Google Drive client).

### --no-update-dir-modtime ###

When using this flag, rclone won't update modification times of remote
directories if they are incorrect as it would normally.

### --order-by string ###

The `--order-by` flag controls the order in which files in the backlog
are processed in `rclone sync`, `rclone copy` and `rclone move`.

The order by string is constructed like this.  The first part
describes what aspect is being measured:

- `size` - order by the size of the files
- `name` - order by the full path of the files
- `modtime` - order by the modification date of the files

This can have a modifier appended with a comma:

- `ascending` or `asc` - order so that the smallest (or oldest) is processed first
- `descending` or `desc` - order so that the largest (or newest) is processed first
- `mixed` - order so that the smallest is processed first for some threads and the largest for others

If the modifier is `mixed` then it can have an optional percentage
(which defaults to `50`), e.g. `size,mixed,25` which means that 25% of
the threads should be taking the smallest items and 75% the
largest. The threads which take the smallest first will always take
the smallest first and likewise the largest first threads. The `mixed`
mode can be useful to minimise the transfer time when you are
transferring a mixture of large and small files - the large files are
guaranteed upload threads and bandwidth and the small files will be
processed continuously.

If no modifier is supplied then the order is `ascending`.

For example

- `--order-by size,desc` - send the largest files first
- `--order-by modtime,ascending` - send the oldest files first
- `--order-by name` - send the files with alphabetically by path first

If the `--order-by` flag is not supplied or it is supplied with an
empty string then the default ordering will be used which is as
scanned.  With `--checkers 1` this is mostly alphabetical, however
with the default `--checkers 8` it is somewhat random.

#### Limitations

The `--order-by` flag does not do a separate pass over the data.  This
means that it may transfer some files out of the order specified if

- there are no files in the backlog or the source has not been fully scanned yet
- there are more than [--max-backlog](#max-backlog-n) files in the backlog

Rclone will do its best to transfer the best file it has so in
practice this should not cause a problem.  Think of `--order-by` as
being more of a best efforts flag rather than a perfect ordering.

If you want perfect ordering then you will need to specify
[--check-first](#check-first) which will find all the files which need
transferring first before transferring any.

### --partial-suffix {#partial-suffix}

When [--inplace](#inplace) is not used, it causes rclone to use
the `--partial-suffix` as suffix for temporary files.

Suffix length limit is 16 characters.

The default is `.partial`.

### --password-command SpaceSepList {#password-command}

This flag supplies a program which should supply the config password
when run. This is an alternative to rclone prompting for the password
or setting the `RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS` variable. It is also used when
setting the config password for the first time.

The argument to this should be a command with a space separated list
of arguments. If one of the arguments has a space in then enclose it
in `"`, if you want a literal `"` in an argument then enclose the
argument in `"` and double the `"`. See [CSV encoding](https://godoc.org/encoding/csv)
for more info.

Eg

    --password-command "echo hello"
    --password-command 'echo "hello with space"'
    --password-command 'echo "hello with ""quotes"" and space"'

Note that when changing the configuration password the environment
variable `RCLONE_PASSWORD_CHANGE=1` will be set. This can be used to
distinguish initial decryption of the config file from the new
password.

See the [Configuration Encryption](#configuration-encryption) for more info.

See a [Windows PowerShell example on the Wiki](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/wiki/Windows-Powershell-use-rclone-password-command-for-Config-file-password).

### -P, --progress ###

This flag makes rclone update the stats in a static block in the
terminal providing a realtime overview of the transfer.

Any log messages will scroll above the static block.  Log messages
will push the static block down to the bottom of the terminal where it
will stay.

Normally this is updated every 500mS but this period can be overridden
with the `--stats` flag.

This can be used with the `--stats-one-line` flag for a simpler
display.

To change the display length of filenames (for different terminal widths),
see the `--stats-file-name-length` option.  The default output is formatted
for 80 character wide terminals.

Note: On Windows until [this bug](https://github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm/issues/26)
is fixed all non-ASCII characters will be replaced with `.` when
`--progress` is in use.

### --progress-terminal-title ###

This flag, when used with `-P/--progress`, will print the string `ETA: %s`
to the terminal title.

### -q, --quiet ###

This flag will limit rclone's output to error messages only.

### --refresh-times ###

The `--refresh-times` flag can be used to update modification times of
existing files when they are out of sync on backends which don't
support hashes.

This is useful if you uploaded files with the incorrect timestamps and
you now wish to correct them.

This flag is **only** useful for destinations which don't support
hashes (e.g. `crypt`).

This can be used any of the sync commands `sync`, `copy` or `move`.

To use this flag you will need to be doing a modification time sync
(so not using `--size-only` or `--checksum`). The flag will have no
effect when using `--size-only` or `--checksum`.

If this flag is used when rclone comes to upload a file it will check
to see if there is an existing file on the destination. If this file
matches the source with size (and checksum if available) but has a
differing timestamp then instead of re-uploading it, rclone will
update the timestamp on the destination file. If the checksum does not
match rclone will upload the new file. If the checksum is absent (e.g.
on a `crypt` backend) then rclone will update the timestamp.

Note that some remotes can't set the modification time without
re-uploading the file so this flag is less useful on them.

Normally if you are doing a modification time sync rclone will update
modification times without `--refresh-times` provided that the remote
supports checksums **and** the checksums match on the file. However if the
checksums are absent then rclone will upload the file rather than
setting the timestamp as this is the safe behaviour.

### --retries int ###

Retry the entire sync if it fails this many times it fails (default 3).

Some remotes can be unreliable and a few retries help pick up the
files which didn't get transferred because of errors.

Disable retries with `--retries 1`.

### --retries-sleep=TIME ###

This sets the interval between each retry specified by `--retries`

The default is `0`. Use `0` to disable.

### --server-side-across-configs ###

Allow server-side operations (e.g. copy or move) to work across
different configurations.

This can be useful if you wish to do a server-side copy or move
between two remotes which use the same backend but are configured
differently.

Note that this isn't enabled by default because it isn't easy for
rclone to tell if it will work between any two configurations.

### --size-only ###

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to
see if they are equal.  If you set this flag then rclone will check
only the size.

This can be useful transferring files from Dropbox which have been
modified by the desktop sync client which doesn't set checksums of
modification times in the same way as rclone.

### --stats=TIME ###

Commands which transfer data (`sync`, `copy`, `copyto`, `move`,
`moveto`) will print data transfer stats at regular intervals to show
their progress.

This sets the interval.

The default is `1m`. Use `0` to disable.

If you set the stats interval then all commands can show stats.  This
can be useful when running other commands, `check` or `mount` for
example.

Stats are logged at `INFO` level by default which means they won't
show at default log level `NOTICE`.  Use `--stats-log-level NOTICE` or
`-v` to make them show.  See the [Logging section](#logging) for more
info on log levels.

Note that on macOS you can send a SIGINFO (which is normally ctrl-T in
the terminal) to make the stats print immediately.

### --stats-file-name-length integer ###
By default, the `--stats` output will truncate file names and paths longer
than 40 characters.  This is equivalent to providing
`--stats-file-name-length 40`. Use `--stats-file-name-length 0` to disable
any truncation of file names printed by stats.

### --stats-log-level string ###

Log level to show `--stats` output at.  This can be `DEBUG`, `INFO`,
`NOTICE`, or `ERROR`.  The default is `INFO`.  This means at the
default level of logging which is `NOTICE` the stats won't show - if
you want them to then use `--stats-log-level NOTICE`.  See the [Logging
section](#logging) for more info on log levels.

### --stats-one-line ###

When this is specified, rclone condenses the stats into a single line
showing the most important stats only.

### --stats-one-line-date ###

When this is specified, rclone enables the single-line stats and prepends
the display with a date string. The default is `2006/01/02 15:04:05 - `

### --stats-one-line-date-format ###

When this is specified, rclone enables the single-line stats and prepends
the display with a user-supplied date string. The date string MUST be
enclosed in quotes. Follow [golang specs](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Format) for
date formatting syntax.

### --stats-unit=bits|bytes ###

By default, data transfer rates will be printed in bytes per second.

This option allows the data rate to be printed in bits per second.

Data transfer volume will still be reported in bytes.

The rate is reported as a binary unit, not SI unit. So 1 Mbit/s
equals 1,048,576 bit/s and not 1,000,000 bit/s.

The default is `bytes`.

### --suffix=SUFFIX ###

When using `sync`, `copy` or `move` any files which would have been
overwritten or deleted will have the suffix added to them.  If there
is a file with the same path (after the suffix has been added), then
it will be overwritten.

The remote in use must support server-side move or copy and you must
use the same remote as the destination of the sync.

This is for use with files to add the suffix in the current directory
or with `--backup-dir`. See `--backup-dir` for more info.

For example

    rclone copy --interactive /path/to/local/file remote:current --suffix .bak

will copy `/path/to/local` to `remote:current`, but for any files
which would have been updated or deleted have .bak added.

If using `rclone sync` with `--suffix` and without `--backup-dir` then
it is recommended to put a filter rule in excluding the suffix
otherwise the `sync` will delete the backup files.

    rclone sync --interactive /path/to/local/file remote:current --suffix .bak --exclude "*.bak"

### --suffix-keep-extension ###

When using `--suffix`, setting this causes rclone put the SUFFIX
before the extension of the files that it backs up rather than after.

So let's say we had `--suffix -2019-01-01`, without the flag `file.txt`
would be backed up to `file.txt-2019-01-01` and with the flag it would
be backed up to `file-2019-01-01.txt`.  This can be helpful to make
sure the suffixed files can still be opened.

If a file has two (or more) extensions and the second (or subsequent)
extension is recognised as a valid mime type, then the suffix will go
before that extension. So `file.tar.gz` would be backed up to
`file-2019-01-01.tar.gz` whereas `file.badextension.gz` would be
backed up to `file.badextension-2019-01-01.gz`.

### --syslog ###

On capable OSes (not Windows or Plan9) send all log output to syslog.

This can be useful for running rclone in a script or `rclone mount`.

### --syslog-facility string ###

If using `--syslog` this sets the syslog facility (e.g. `KERN`, `USER`).
See `man syslog` for a list of possible facilities.  The default
facility is `DAEMON`.

### --temp-dir=DIR ###

Specify the directory rclone will use for temporary files, to override
the default. Make sure the directory exists and have accessible permissions.

By default the operating system's temp directory will be used:
- On Unix systems, `$TMPDIR` if non-empty, else `/tmp`.
- On Windows, the first non-empty value from `%TMP%`, `%TEMP%`, `%USERPROFILE%`, or the Windows directory.

When overriding the default with this option, the specified path will be
set as value of environment variable `TMPDIR` on Unix systems
and `TMP` and `TEMP` on Windows.

You can use the [config paths](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_paths/)
command to see the current value.

### --tpslimit float ###

Limit transactions per second to this number. Default is 0 which is
used to mean unlimited transactions per second.

A transaction is roughly defined as an API call; its exact meaning
will depend on the backend. For HTTP based backends it is an HTTP
PUT/GET/POST/etc and its response. For FTP/SFTP it is a round trip
transaction over TCP.

For example, to limit rclone to 10 transactions per second use
`--tpslimit 10`, or to 1 transaction every 2 seconds use `--tpslimit
0.5`.

Use this when the number of transactions per second from rclone is
causing a problem with the cloud storage provider (e.g. getting you
banned or rate limited).

This can be very useful for `rclone mount` to control the behaviour of
applications using it.

This limit applies to all HTTP based backends and to the FTP and SFTP
backends. It does not apply to the local backend or the Storj backend.

See also `--tpslimit-burst`.

### --tpslimit-burst int ###

Max burst of transactions for `--tpslimit` (default `1`).

Normally `--tpslimit` will do exactly the number of transaction per
second specified.  However if you supply `--tps-burst` then rclone can
save up some transactions from when it was idle giving a burst of up
to the parameter supplied.

For example if you provide `--tpslimit-burst 10` then if rclone has
been idle for more than 10*`--tpslimit` then it can do 10 transactions
very quickly before they are limited again.

This may be used to increase performance of `--tpslimit` without
changing the long term average number of transactions per second.

### --track-renames ###

By default, rclone doesn't keep track of renamed files, so if you
rename a file locally then sync it to a remote, rclone will delete the
old file on the remote and upload a new copy.

An rclone sync with `--track-renames` runs like a normal sync, but keeps
track of objects which exist in the destination but not in the source
(which would normally be deleted), and which objects exist in the
source but not the destination (which would normally be transferred).
These objects are then candidates for renaming.

After the sync, rclone matches up the source only and destination only
objects using the `--track-renames-strategy` specified and either
renames the destination object or transfers the source and deletes the
destination object. `--track-renames` is stateless like all of
rclone's syncs.

To use this flag the destination must support server-side copy or
server-side move, and to use a hash based `--track-renames-strategy`
(the default) the source and the destination must have a compatible
hash.

If the destination does not support server-side copy or move, rclone
will fall back to the default behaviour and log an error level message
to the console.

Encrypted destinations are not currently supported by `--track-renames`
if `--track-renames-strategy` includes `hash`.

Note that `--track-renames` is incompatible with `--no-traverse` and
that it uses extra memory to keep track of all the rename candidates.

Note also that `--track-renames` is incompatible with
`--delete-before` and will select `--delete-after` instead of
`--delete-during`.

### --track-renames-strategy (hash,modtime,leaf,size) ###

This option changes the file matching criteria for `--track-renames`.

The matching is controlled by a comma separated selection of these tokens:

- `modtime` - the modification time of the file - not supported on all backends
- `hash` - the hash of the file contents - not supported on all backends
- `leaf` - the name of the file not including its directory name
- `size` - the size of the file (this is always enabled)

The default option is `hash`.

Using `--track-renames-strategy modtime,leaf` would match files
based on modification time, the leaf of the file name and the size
only.

Using `--track-renames-strategy modtime` or `leaf` can enable
`--track-renames` support for encrypted destinations.

Note that the `hash` strategy is not supported with encrypted destinations.

### --delete-(before,during,after) ###

This option allows you to specify when files on your destination are
deleted when you sync folders.

Specifying the value `--delete-before` will delete all files present
on the destination, but not on the source *before* starting the
transfer of any new or updated files. This uses two passes through the
file systems, one for the deletions and one for the copies.

Specifying `--delete-during` will delete files while checking and
uploading files. This is the fastest option and uses the least memory.

Specifying `--delete-after` (the default value) will delay deletion of
files until all new/updated files have been successfully transferred.
The files to be deleted are collected in the copy pass then deleted
after the copy pass has completed successfully.  The files to be
deleted are held in memory so this mode may use more memory.  This is
the safest mode as it will only delete files if there have been no
errors subsequent to that.  If there have been errors before the
deletions start then you will get the message `not deleting files as
there were IO errors`.

### --fast-list ###

When doing anything which involves a directory listing (e.g. `sync`,
`copy`, `ls` - in fact nearly every command), rclone has different
strategies to choose from.

The basic strategy is to list one directory and processes it before using
more directory lists to process any subdirectories. This is a mandatory
backend feature, called `List`, which means it is supported by all backends.
This strategy uses small amount of memory, and because it can be parallelised
it is fast for operations involving processing of the list results.

Some backends provide the support for an alternative strategy, where all
files beneath a directory can be listed in one (or a small number) of
transactions. Rclone supports this alternative strategy through an optional
backend feature called [`ListR`](https://rclone.org/overview/#listr). You can see in the storage
system overview documentation's [optional features](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
section which backends it is enabled for (these tend to be the bucket-based
ones, e.g. S3, B2, GCS, Swift). This strategy requires fewer transactions
for highly recursive operations, which is important on backends where this
is charged or heavily rate limited. It may be faster (due to fewer transactions)
or slower (because it can't be parallelized) depending on different parameters,
and may require more memory if rclone has to keep the whole listing in memory.

Which listing strategy rclone picks for a given operation is complicated, but
in general it tries to choose the best possible. It will prefer `ListR` in
situations where it doesn't need to store the listed files in memory, e.g.
for unlimited recursive `ls` command variants. In other situations it will
prefer `List`, e.g. for `sync` and `copy`, where it needs to keep the listed
files in memory, and is performing operations on them where parallelization
may be a huge advantage.

Rclone is not able to take all relevant parameters into account for deciding
the best strategy, and therefore allows you to influence the choice in two ways:
You can stop rclone from using `ListR` by disabling the feature, using the
[--disable](#disable-feature-feature) option (`--disable ListR`), or you can
allow rclone to use `ListR` where it would normally choose not to do so due to
higher memory usage, using the `--fast-list` option. Rclone should always
produce identical results either way. Using `--disable ListR` or `--fast-list`
on a remote which doesn't support `ListR` does nothing, rclone will just ignore
it.

A rule of thumb is that if you pay for transactions and can fit your entire
sync listing into memory, then `--fast-list` is recommended. If you have a
very big sync to do, then don't use `--fast-list`, otherwise you will run out
of memory. Run some tests and compare before you decide, and if in doubt then
just leave the default, let rclone decide, i.e. not use `--fast-list`.

### --timeout=TIME ###

This sets the IO idle timeout.  If a transfer has started but then
becomes idle for this long it is considered broken and disconnected.

The default is `5m`.  Set to `0` to disable.

### --transfers=N ###

The number of file transfers to run in parallel.  It can sometimes be
useful to set this to a smaller number if the remote is giving a lot
of timeouts or bigger if you have lots of bandwidth and a fast remote.

The default is to run 4 file transfers in parallel.

Look at --multi-thread-streams if you would like to control single file transfers.

### -u, --update ###

This forces rclone to skip any files which exist on the destination
and have a modified time that is newer than the source file.

This can be useful in avoiding needless transfers when transferring to
a remote which doesn't support modification times directly (or when
using `--use-server-modtime` to avoid extra API calls) as it is more
accurate than a `--size-only` check and faster than using
`--checksum`. On such remotes (or when using `--use-server-modtime`)
the time checked will be the uploaded time.

If an existing destination file has a modification time older than the
source file's, it will be updated if the sizes are different. If the
sizes are the same, it will be updated if the checksum is different or
not available.

If an existing destination file has a modification time equal (within
the computed modify window) to the source file's, it will be updated
if the sizes are different. The checksum will not be checked in this
case unless the `--checksum` flag is provided.

In all other cases the file will not be updated.

Consider using the `--modify-window` flag to compensate for time skews
between the source and the backend, for backends that do not support
mod times, and instead use uploaded times. However, if the backend
does not support checksums, note that syncing or copying within the
time skew window may still result in additional transfers for safety.

### --use-mmap ###

If this flag is set then rclone will use anonymous memory allocated by
mmap on Unix based platforms and VirtualAlloc on Windows for its
transfer buffers (size controlled by `--buffer-size`).  Memory
allocated like this does not go on the Go heap and can be returned to
the OS immediately when it is finished with.

If this flag is not set then rclone will allocate and free the buffers
using the Go memory allocator which may use more memory as memory
pages are returned less aggressively to the OS.

It is possible this does not work well on all platforms so it is
disabled by default; in the future it may be enabled by default.

### --use-server-modtime ###

Some object-store backends (e.g, Swift, S3) do not preserve file modification
times (modtime). On these backends, rclone stores the original modtime as
additional metadata on the object. By default it will make an API call to
retrieve the metadata when the modtime is needed by an operation.

Use this flag to disable the extra API call and rely instead on the server's
modified time. In cases such as a local to remote sync using `--update`,
knowing the local file is newer than the time it was last uploaded to the
remote is sufficient. In those cases, this flag can speed up the process and
reduce the number of API calls necessary.

Using this flag on a sync operation without also using `--update` would cause
all files modified at any time other than the last upload time to be uploaded
again, which is probably not what you want.

### -v, -vv, --verbose ###

With `-v` rclone will tell you about each file that is transferred and
a small number of significant events.

With `-vv` rclone will become very verbose telling you about every
file it considers and transfers.  Please send bug reports with a log
with this setting.

When setting verbosity as an environment variable, use
`RCLONE_VERBOSE=1` or `RCLONE_VERBOSE=2` for `-v` and `-vv` respectively.

### -V, --version ###

Prints the version number

SSL/TLS options
---------------

The outgoing SSL/TLS connections rclone makes can be controlled with
these options.  For example this can be very useful with the HTTP or
WebDAV backends. Rclone HTTP servers have their own set of
configuration for SSL/TLS which you can find in their documentation.

### --ca-cert stringArray

This loads the PEM encoded certificate authority certificates and uses
it to verify the certificates of the servers rclone connects to.

If you have generated certificates signed with a local CA then you
will need this flag to connect to servers using those certificates.

### --client-cert string

This loads the PEM encoded client side certificate.

This is used for [mutual TLS authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication).

The `--client-key` flag is required too when using this.

### --client-key string

This loads the PEM encoded client side private key used for mutual TLS
authentication.  Used in conjunction with `--client-cert`.

### --no-check-certificate=true/false ###

`--no-check-certificate` controls whether a client verifies the
server's certificate chain and host name.
If `--no-check-certificate` is true, TLS accepts any certificate
presented by the server and any host name in that certificate.
In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

This option defaults to `false`.

**This should be used only for testing.**

Configuration Encryption
------------------------
Your configuration file contains information for logging in to
your cloud services. This means that you should keep your
`rclone.conf` file in a secure location.

If you are in an environment where that isn't possible, you can
add a password to your configuration. This means that you will
have to supply the password every time you start rclone.

To add a password to your rclone configuration, execute `rclone config`.

```
>rclone config
Current remotes:

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/s/q>
```

Go into `s`, Set configuration password:
```
e/n/d/s/q> s
Your configuration is not encrypted.
If you add a password, you will protect your login information to cloud services.
a) Add Password
q) Quit to main menu
a/q> a
Enter NEW configuration password:
password:
Confirm NEW password:
password:
Password set
Your configuration is encrypted.
c) Change Password
u) Unencrypt configuration
q) Quit to main menu
c/u/q>
```

Your configuration is now encrypted, and every time you start rclone
you will have to supply the password. See below for details.
In the same menu, you can change the password or completely remove
encryption from your configuration.

There is no way to recover the configuration if you lose your password.

You can also use

- [rclone config encryption set](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_encryption_set/) to set the config encryption directly
- [rclone config encryption remove](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_encryption_remove/) to remove it
- [rclone config encryption check](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_encryption_check/) to check that it is encrypted properly.

rclone uses [nacl secretbox](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox)
which in turn uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate
your configuration with secret-key cryptography.
The password is SHA-256 hashed, which produces the key for secretbox.
The hashed password is not stored.

While this provides very good security, we do not recommend storing
your encrypted rclone configuration in public if it contains sensitive
information, maybe except if you use a very strong password.

If it is safe in your environment, you can set the `RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS`
environment variable to contain your password, in which case it will be
used for decrypting the configuration.

You can set this for a session from a script.  For unix like systems
save this to a file called `set-rclone-password`:

```
#!/bin/echo Source this file don't run it

read -s RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
export RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
```

Then source the file when you want to use it.  From the shell you
would do `source set-rclone-password`.  It will then ask you for the
password and set it in the environment variable.

An alternate means of supplying the password is to provide a script
which will retrieve the password and print on standard output.  This
script should have a fully specified path name and not rely on any
environment variables.  The script is supplied either via
[`--password-command="..."`](#password-command) command line argument or via the
`RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND` environment variable.

One useful example of this is using the `passwordstore` application
to retrieve the password:

```
export RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND="pass rclone/config"
```

If the `passwordstore` password manager holds the password for the
rclone configuration, using the script method means the password
is primarily protected by the `passwordstore` system, and is never
embedded in the clear in scripts, nor available for examination
using the standard commands available.  It is quite possible with
long running rclone sessions for copies of passwords to be innocently
captured in log files or terminal scroll buffers, etc.  Using the
script method of supplying the password enhances the security of
the config password considerably.

If you are running rclone inside a script, unless you are using the
`--password-command` method, you might want to disable
password prompts. To do that, pass the parameter
`--ask-password=false` to rclone. This will make rclone fail instead
of asking for a password if `RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS` doesn't contain
a valid password, and `--password-command` has not been supplied.

Whenever running commands that may be affected by options in a
configuration file, rclone will look for an existing file according
to the rules described [above](#config-config-file), and load any it
finds. If an encrypted file is found, this includes decrypting it,
with the possible consequence of a password prompt. When executing
a command line that you know are not actually using anything from such
a configuration file, you can avoid it being loaded by overriding the
location, e.g. with one of the documented special values for
memory-only configuration. Since only backend options can be stored
in configuration files, this is normally unnecessary for commands
that do not operate on backends, e.g. `completion`. However,
it will be relevant for commands that do operate on backends in
general, but are used without referencing a stored remote, e.g.
listing local filesystem paths, or
[connection strings](#connection-strings): `rclone --config="" ls .`

Configuration Encryption Cheatsheet
-----------------------------------
You can quickly apply a configuration encryption without plain-text
at rest or transfer. Detailed instructions for popular OSes:

### Mac ###

* Generate and store a password

`security add-generic-password -a rclone -s config -w $(openssl rand -base64 40)`

* Add the retrieval instruction to your .zprofile / .profile

`export RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND="/usr/bin/security find-generic-password -a rclone -s config -w"`

### Linux ###

* Prerequisite

Linux doesn't come with a default password manager. Let's install
the "pass" utility using a package manager, e.g. `apt install pass`,
 `yum install pass`,
 [etc.](https://www.passwordstore.org/#download); then initialize a
 password store:

`pass init rclone`

* Generate and store a password

`echo $(openssl rand -base64 40) | pass insert -m rclone/config`

* Add the retrieval instruction

`export RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND="/usr/bin/pass rclone/config"`

### Windows ###

* Generate and store a password

`New-Object -TypeName PSCredential -ArgumentList "rclone", (ConvertTo-SecureString -String ([System.Web.Security.Membership]::GeneratePassword(40, 10)) -AsPlainText -Force) | Export-Clixml -Path "rclone-credential.xml"`

* Add the password retrieval instruction

`[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND", "[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto([System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR((Import-Clixml -Path "rclone-credential.xml").Password))")`

### Encrypt the config file (all systems) ###

* Execute `rclone config` -> `s`

* Add/update the password from previous steps

Developer options
-----------------

These options are useful when developing or debugging rclone.  There
are also some more remote specific options which aren't documented
here which are used for testing.  These start with remote name e.g.
`--drive-test-option` - see the docs for the remote in question.

### --cpuprofile=FILE ###

Write CPU profile to file.  This can be analysed with `go tool pprof`.

#### --dump flag,flag,flag ####

The `--dump` flag takes a comma separated list of flags to dump info
about.

Note that some headers including `Accept-Encoding` as shown may not
be correct in the request and the response may not show `Content-Encoding`
if the go standard libraries auto gzip encoding was in effect. In this case
the body of the request will be gunzipped before showing it.

The available flags are:

#### --dump headers ####

Dump HTTP headers with `Authorization:` lines removed. May still
contain sensitive info.  Can be very verbose.  Useful for debugging
only.

Use `--dump auth` if you do want the `Authorization:` headers.

#### --dump bodies ####

Dump HTTP headers and bodies - may contain sensitive info.  Can be
very verbose.  Useful for debugging only.

Note that the bodies are buffered in memory so don't use this for
enormous files.

#### --dump requests ####

Like `--dump bodies` but dumps the request bodies and the response
headers.  Useful for debugging download problems.

#### --dump responses ####

Like `--dump bodies` but dumps the response bodies and the request
headers. Useful for debugging upload problems.

#### --dump auth ####

Dump HTTP headers - will contain sensitive info such as
`Authorization:` headers - use `--dump headers` to dump without
`Authorization:` headers.  Can be very verbose.  Useful for debugging
only.

#### --dump filters ####

Dump the filters to the output.  Useful to see exactly what include
and exclude options are filtering on.

#### --dump goroutines ####

This dumps a list of the running go-routines at the end of the command
to standard output.

#### --dump openfiles ####

This dumps a list of the open files at the end of the command.  It
uses the `lsof` command to do that so you'll need that installed to
use it.

#### --dump mapper ####

This shows the JSON blobs being sent to the program supplied with
`--metadata-mapper` and received from it. It can be useful for
debugging the metadata mapper interface.

### --memprofile=FILE ###

Write memory profile to file. This can be analysed with `go tool pprof`.

See the [filtering section](https://rclone.org/filtering/).

Remote control
--------------

For the remote control options and for instructions on how to remote control rclone

  * `--rc`
  * and anything starting with `--rc-`

See [the remote control section](https://rclone.org/rc/).

Logging
-------

rclone has 4 levels of logging, `ERROR`, `NOTICE`, `INFO` and `DEBUG`.

By default, rclone logs to standard error.  This means you can redirect
standard error and still see the normal output of rclone commands (e.g.
`rclone ls`).

By default, rclone will produce `Error` and `Notice` level messages.

If you use the `-q` flag, rclone will only produce `Error` messages.

If you use the `-v` flag, rclone will produce `Error`, `Notice` and
`Info` messages.

If you use the `-vv` flag, rclone will produce `Error`, `Notice`,
`Info` and `Debug` messages.

You can also control the log levels with the `--log-level` flag.

If you use the `--log-file=FILE` option, rclone will redirect `Error`,
`Info` and `Debug` messages along with standard error to FILE.

If you use the `--syslog` flag then rclone will log to syslog and the
`--syslog-facility` control which facility it uses.

Rclone prefixes all log messages with their level in capitals, e.g. INFO
which makes it easy to grep the log file for different kinds of
information.

Metrics
-------

Rclone can publish metrics in the OpenMetrics/Prometheus format.

To enable the metrics endpoint, use the `--metrics-addr` flag. Metrics can also be published on the `--rc-addr` port if the `--rc` flag and `--rc-enable-metrics` flags are supplied or if using rclone rcd `--rc-enable-metrics`

Rclone provides extensive configuration options for the metrics HTTP endpoint. These settings are grouped under the Metrics section and have a prefix `--metrics-*`.

When metrics are enabled with `--rc-enable-metrics`, they will be published on the same port as the rc API. In this case, the `--metrics-*` flags will be ignored, and the HTTP endpoint configuration will be managed by the `--rc-*` parameters.

Exit Code
---------

If any errors occur during the command execution, rclone will exit with a
non-zero exit code.  This allows scripts to detect when rclone
operations have failed.

During the startup phase, rclone will exit immediately if an error is
detected in the configuration.  There will always be a log message
immediately before exiting.

When rclone is running it will accumulate errors as it goes along, and
only exit with a non-zero exit code if (after retries) there were
still failed transfers.  For every error counted there will be a high
priority log message (visible with `-q`) showing the message and
which file caused the problem. A high priority message is also shown
when starting a retry so the user can see that any previous error
messages may not be valid after the retry. If rclone has done a retry
it will log a high priority message if the retry was successful.

### List of exit codes ###
  * `0` - success
  * `1` - Syntax or usage error
  * `2` - Error not otherwise categorised
  * `3` - Directory not found
  * `4` - File not found
  * `5` - Temporary error (one that more retries might fix) (Retry errors)
  * `6` - Less serious errors (like 461 errors from dropbox) (NoRetry errors)
  * `7` - Fatal error (one that more retries won't fix, like account suspended) (Fatal errors)
  * `8` - Transfer exceeded - limit set by --max-transfer reached
  * `9` - Operation successful, but no files transferred (Requires [`--error-on-no-transfer`](#error-on-no-transfer))
  * `10` - Duration exceeded - limit set by --max-duration reached

Environment Variables
---------------------

Rclone can be configured entirely using environment variables.  These
can be used to set defaults for options or config file entries.

### Options ###

Every option in rclone can have its default set by environment
variable.

To find the name of the environment variable, first, take the long
option name, strip the leading `--`, change `-` to `_`, make
upper case and prepend `RCLONE_`.

For example, to always set `--stats 5s`, set the environment variable
`RCLONE_STATS=5s`.  If you set stats on the command line this will
override the environment variable setting.

Or to always use the trash in drive `--drive-use-trash`, set
`RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH=true`.

Verbosity is slightly different, the environment variable 
equivalent of `--verbose` or `-v` is `RCLONE_VERBOSE=1`, 
or for `-vv`, `RCLONE_VERBOSE=2`.

The same parser is used for the options and the environment variables
so they take exactly the same form.

The options set by environment variables can be seen with the `-vv` flag, e.g. `rclone version -vv`.

### Config file ###

You can set defaults for values in the config file on an individual
remote basis. The names of the config items are documented in the page
for each backend.

To find the name of the environment variable, you need to set, take
`RCLONE_CONFIG_` + name of remote + `_` + name of config file option
and make it all uppercase.
Note one implication here is the remote's name must be
convertible into a valid environment variable name,
so it can only contain letters, digits, or the `_` (underscore) character.

For example, to configure an S3 remote named `mys3:` without a config
file (using unix ways of setting environment variables):

```
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_TYPE=s3
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
$ rclone lsd mys3:
          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
$ rclone listremotes | grep mys3
mys3:
```

Note that if you want to create a remote using environment variables
you must create the `..._TYPE` variable as above.

Note that the name of a remote created using environment variable is
case insensitive, in contrast to regular remotes stored in config
file as documented [above](#valid-remote-names).
You must write the name in uppercase in the environment variable, but
as seen from example above it will be listed and can be accessed in
lowercase, while you can also refer to the same remote in uppercase:
```
$ rclone lsd mys3:
          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
$ rclone lsd MYS3:
          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
```


Note that you can only set the options of the immediate backend, 
so RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3CRYPT_ACCESS_KEY_ID has no effect, if myS3Crypt is 
a crypt remote based on an S3 remote. However RCLONE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID will 
set the access key of all remotes using S3, including myS3Crypt.

Note also that now rclone has [connection strings](#connection-strings),
it is probably easier to use those instead which makes the above example

    rclone lsd :s3,access_key_id=XXX,secret_access_key=XXX:

### Precedence

The various different methods of backend configuration are read in
this order and the first one with a value is used.

- Parameters in connection strings, e.g. `myRemote,skip_links:`
- Flag values as supplied on the command line, e.g. `--skip-links`
- Remote specific environment vars, e.g. `RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_SKIP_LINKS` (see above).
- Backend-specific environment vars, e.g. `RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS`.
- Backend generic environment vars, e.g. `RCLONE_SKIP_LINKS`.
- Config file, e.g. `skip_links = true`.
- Default values, e.g. `false` - these can't be changed.

So if both `--skip-links` is supplied on the command line and an
environment variable `RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS` is set, the command line
flag will take preference.

The backend configurations set by environment variables can be seen with the `-vv` flag, e.g. `rclone about myRemote: -vv`.

For non backend configuration the order is as follows:

- Flag values as supplied on the command line, e.g. `--stats 5s`.
- Environment vars, e.g. `RCLONE_STATS=5s`.
- Default values, e.g. `1m` - these can't be changed.

### Other environment variables ###

- `RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS` set to contain your config file password (see [Configuration Encryption](#configuration-encryption) section)
- `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` (or the lowercase versions thereof).
    - `HTTPS_PROXY` takes precedence over `HTTP_PROXY` for https requests.
    - The environment values may be either a complete URL or a "host[:port]" for, in which case the "http" scheme is assumed.
- `USER` and `LOGNAME` values are used as fallbacks for current username. The primary method for looking up username is OS-specific: Windows API on Windows, real user ID in /etc/passwd on Unix systems. In the documentation the current username is simply referred to as `$USER`.
- `RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR` - rclone **sets** this variable for use in config files and sub processes to point to the directory holding the config file.

The options set by environment variables can be seen with the `-vv` and `--log-level=DEBUG` flags, e.g. `rclone version -vv`.

# Configuring rclone on a remote / headless machine #

Some of the configurations (those involving oauth2) require an
Internet connected web browser.

If you are trying to set rclone up on a remote or headless box with no
browser available on it (e.g. a NAS or a server in a datacenter) then
you will need to use an alternative means of configuration.  There are
two ways of doing it, described below.

## Configuring using rclone authorize ##

On the headless box run `rclone` config but answer `N` to the `Use auto config?` question.

```
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine

y) Yes (default)
n) No
y/n> n

Option config_token.
For this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has
a web browser available.
For more help and alternate methods see: https://rclone.org/remote_setup/
Execute the following on the machine with the web browser (same rclone
version recommended):
	rclone authorize "onedrive"
Then paste the result.
Enter a value.
config_token>
```

Then on your main desktop machine

```
rclone authorize "onedrive"
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
Paste the following into your remote machine --->
SECRET_TOKEN
<---End paste
```

Then back to the headless box, paste in the code

```
config_token> SECRET_TOKEN
--------------------
[acd12]
client_id = 
client_secret = 
token = SECRET_TOKEN
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d>
```

## Configuring by copying the config file ##

Rclone stores all of its config in a single configuration file.  This
can easily be copied to configure a remote rclone.

So first configure rclone on your desktop machine with

    rclone config

to set up the config file.

Find the config file by running `rclone config file`, for example

```
$ rclone config file
Configuration file is stored at:
/home/user/.rclone.conf
```

Now transfer it to the remote box (scp, cut paste, ftp, sftp, etc.) and
place it in the correct place (use `rclone config file` on the remote
box to find out where).

## Configuring using SSH Tunnel ##

Linux and MacOS users can utilize SSH Tunnel to redirect the headless box port 53682 to local machine by using the following command:
```
ssh -L localhost:53682:localhost:53682 username@remote_server
```
Then on the headless box run `rclone config` and answer `Y` to the `Use auto config?` question.

```
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine

y) Yes (default)
n) No
y/n> y
```
Then copy and paste the auth url `http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth?state=xxxxxxxxxxxx` to the browser on your local machine, complete the auth and it is done.

# Filtering, includes and excludes

Filter flags determine which files rclone `sync`, `move`, `ls`, `lsl`,
`md5sum`, `sha1sum`, `size`, `delete`, `check` and similar commands
apply to.

They are specified in terms of path/file name patterns; path/file
lists; file age and size, or presence of a file in a directory. Bucket
based remotes without the concept of directory apply filters to object
key, age and size in an analogous way.

Rclone `purge` does not obey filters.

To test filters without risk of damage to data, apply them to `rclone
ls`, or with the `--dry-run` and `-vv` flags.

Rclone filter patterns can only be used in filter command line options, not
in the specification of a remote.

E.g. `rclone copy "remote:dir*.jpg" /path/to/dir` does not have a filter effect.
`rclone copy remote:dir /path/to/dir --include "*.jpg"` does.

**Important** Avoid mixing any two of `--include...`, `--exclude...` or
`--filter...` flags in an rclone command. The results might not be what
you expect. Instead use a `--filter...` flag.

## Patterns for matching path/file names

### Pattern syntax {#patterns}

Here is a formal definition of the pattern syntax,
[examples](#examples) are below.

Rclone matching rules follow a glob style:

    *         matches any sequence of non-separator (/) characters
    **        matches any sequence of characters including / separators
    ?         matches any single non-separator (/) character
    [ [ ! ] { character-range } ]
              character class (must be non-empty)
    { pattern-list }
              pattern alternatives
    {{ regexp }}
              regular expression to match
    c         matches character c (c != *, **, ?, \, [, {, })
    \c        matches reserved character c (c = *, **, ?, \, [, {, }) or character class

character-range:

    c         matches character c (c != \, -, ])
    \c        matches reserved character c (c = \, -, ])
    lo - hi   matches character c for lo <= c <= hi

pattern-list:

    pattern { , pattern }
              comma-separated (without spaces) patterns

character classes (see [Go regular expression reference](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/)) include:

    Named character classes (e.g. [\d], [^\d], [\D], [^\D])
    Perl character classes (e.g. \s, \S, \w, \W)
    ASCII character classes (e.g. [[:alnum:]], [[:alpha:]], [[:punct:]], [[:xdigit:]])

regexp for advanced users to insert a regular expression - see [below](#regexp) for more info:

    Any re2 regular expression not containing `}}`

If the filter pattern starts with a `/` then it only matches
at the top level of the directory tree,
**relative to the root of the remote** (not necessarily the root
of the drive). If it does not start with `/` then it is matched
starting at the **end of the path/file name** but it only matches
a complete path element - it must match from a `/`
separator or the beginning of the path/file.

    file.jpg   - matches "file.jpg"
               - matches "directory/file.jpg"
               - doesn't match "afile.jpg"
               - doesn't match "directory/afile.jpg"
    /file.jpg  - matches "file.jpg" in the root directory of the remote
               - doesn't match "afile.jpg"
               - doesn't match "directory/file.jpg"

The top level of the remote might not be the top level of the drive.

E.g. for a Microsoft Windows local directory structure

    F:
    ├── bkp
    ├── data
    │   ├── excl
    │   │   ├── 123.jpg
    │   │   └── 456.jpg
    │   ├── incl
    │   │   └── document.pdf

To copy the contents of folder `data` into folder `bkp` excluding the contents of subfolder
`excl`the following command treats `F:\data` and `F:\bkp` as top level for filtering.

`rclone copy F:\data\ F:\bkp\ --exclude=/excl/**`

**Important** Use `/` in path/file name patterns and not `\` even if
running on Microsoft Windows.

Simple patterns are case sensitive unless the `--ignore-case` flag is used.

Without `--ignore-case` (default)

    potato - matches "potato"
           - doesn't match "POTATO"

With `--ignore-case`

    potato - matches "potato"
           - matches "POTATO"

## Using regular expressions in filter patterns {#regexp}

The syntax of filter patterns is glob style matching (like `bash`
uses) to make things easy for users. However this does not provide
absolute control over the matching, so for advanced users rclone also
provides a regular expression syntax.

The regular expressions used are as defined in the [Go regular
expression reference](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/). Regular
expressions should be enclosed in `{{` `}}`. They will match only the
last path segment if the glob doesn't start with `/` or the whole path
name if it does. Note that rclone does not attempt to parse the
supplied regular expression, meaning that using any regular expression
filter will prevent rclone from using [directory filter rules](#directory_filter),
as it will instead check every path against
the supplied regular expression(s).

Here is how the `{{regexp}}` is transformed into an full regular
expression to match the entire path:

    {{regexp}}  becomes (^|/)(regexp)$
    /{{regexp}} becomes ^(regexp)$

Regexp syntax can be mixed with glob syntax, for example

    *.{{jpe?g}} to match file.jpg, file.jpeg but not file.png

You can also use regexp flags - to set case insensitive, for example

    *.{{(?i)jpg}} to match file.jpg, file.JPG but not file.png

Be careful with wildcards in regular expressions - you don't want them
to match path separators normally. To match any file name starting
with `start` and ending with `end` write

    {{start[^/]*end\.jpg}}

Not

    {{start.*end\.jpg}}

Which will match a directory called `start` with a file called
`end.jpg` in it as the `.*` will match `/` characters.

Note that you can use `-vv --dump filters` to show the filter patterns
in regexp format - rclone implements the glob patterns by transforming
them into regular expressions.

## Filter pattern examples {#examples}

| Description | Pattern | Matches | Does not match |
| ----------- |-------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Wildcard    | `*.jpg` | `/file.jpg`     | `/file.png`    |
|             |         | `/dir/file.jpg` | `/dir/file.png` |
| Rooted      | `/*.jpg` | `/file.jpg`    | `/file.png`    |
|             |          | `/file2.jpg`    | `/dir/file.jpg` |
| Alternates  | `*.{jpg,png}` | `/file.jpg`     | `/file.gif`    |
|             |         | `/dir/file.png` | `/dir/file.gif` |
| Path Wildcard | `dir/**` | `/dir/anyfile`     | `file.png`    |
|             |          | `/subdir/dir/subsubdir/anyfile` | `/subdir/file.png` |
| Any Char    | `*.t?t` | `/file.txt`     | `/file.qxt`    |
|             |         | `/dir/file.tzt` | `/dir/file.png` |
| Range       | `*.[a-z]` | `/file.a`     | `/file.0`    |
|             |         | `/dir/file.b` | `/dir/file.1` |
| Escape      | `*.\?\?\?` | `/file.???`     | `/file.abc`    |
|             |         | `/dir/file.???` | `/dir/file.def` |
| Class       | `*.\d\d\d` | `/file.012`     | `/file.abc`    |
|             |         | `/dir/file.345` | `/dir/file.def` |
| Regexp      | `*.{{jpe?g}}` | `/file.jpeg`     | `/file.png`    |
|             |         | `/dir/file.jpg` | `/dir/file.jpeeg` |
| Rooted Regexp | `/{{.*\.jpe?g}}` | `/file.jpeg`  | `/file.png`    |
|             |                  | `/file.jpg`   | `/dir/file.jpg` |

## How filter rules are applied to files {#how-filter-rules-work}

Rclone path/file name filters are made up of one or more of the following flags:

  * `--include`
  * `--include-from`
  * `--exclude`
  * `--exclude-from`
  * `--filter`
  * `--filter-from`

There can be more than one instance of individual flags.

Rclone internally uses a combined list of all the include and exclude
rules. The order in which rules are processed can influence the result
of the filter.

All flags of the same type are processed together in the order
above, regardless of what order the different types of flags are
included on the command line.

Multiple instances of the same flag are processed from left
to right according to their position in the command line.

To mix up the order of processing includes and excludes use `--filter...`
flags.

Within `--include-from`, `--exclude-from` and `--filter-from` flags
rules are processed from top to bottom of the referenced file.

If there is an `--include` or `--include-from` flag specified, rclone
implies a `- **` rule which it adds to the bottom of the internal rule
list. Specifying a `+` rule with a `--filter...` flag does not imply
that rule.

Each path/file name passed through rclone is matched against the
combined filter list. At first match to a rule the path/file name
is included or excluded and no further filter rules are processed for
that path/file.

If rclone does not find a match, after testing against all rules
(including the implied rule if appropriate), the path/file name
is included.

Any path/file included at that stage is processed by the rclone
command.

`--files-from` and `--files-from-raw` flags over-ride and cannot be
combined with other filter options.

To see the internal combined rule list, in regular expression form,
for a command add the `--dump filters` flag. Running an rclone command
with `--dump filters` and `-vv` flags lists the internal filter elements
and shows how they are applied to each source path/file. There is not
currently a means provided to pass regular expression filter options into
rclone directly though character class filter rules contain character
classes. [Go regular expression reference](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/)

### How filter rules are applied to directories {#directory_filter}

Rclone commands are applied to path/file names not
directories. The entire contents of a directory can be matched
to a filter by the pattern `directory/*` or recursively by
`directory/**`.

Directory filter rules are defined with a closing `/` separator.

E.g. `/directory/subdirectory/` is an rclone directory filter rule.

Rclone commands can use directory filter rules to determine whether they
recurse into subdirectories. This potentially optimises access to a remote
by avoiding listing unnecessary directories. Whether optimisation is
desirable depends on the specific filter rules and source remote content.

If any [regular expression filters](#regexp) are in use, then no
directory recursion optimisation is possible, as rclone must check
every path against the supplied regular expression(s).

Directory recursion optimisation occurs if either:

* A source remote does not support the rclone `ListR` primitive. local,
sftp, Microsoft OneDrive and WebDAV do not support `ListR`. Google
Drive and most bucket type storage do. [Full list](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)

* On other remotes (those that support `ListR`), if the rclone command is not naturally recursive, and
provided it is not run with the `--fast-list` flag. `ls`, `lsf -R` and
`size` are naturally recursive but `sync`, `copy` and `move` are not.

* Whenever the `--disable ListR` flag is applied to an rclone command.

Rclone commands imply directory filter rules from path/file filter
rules. To view the directory filter rules rclone has implied for a
command specify the `--dump filters` flag.

E.g. for an include rule

    /a/*.jpg

Rclone implies the directory include rule

    /a/

Directory filter rules specified in an rclone command can limit
the scope of an rclone command but path/file filters still have
to be specified.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --include /directory/` will not match any
files. Because it is an `--include` option the `--exclude **` rule
is implied, and the `/directory/` pattern serves only to optimise
access to the remote by ignoring everything outside of that directory.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --filter-from filter-list.txt` with a file
`filter-list.txt`:

    - /dir1/
    - /dir2/
    + *.pdf
    - **

All files in directories `dir1` or `dir2` or their subdirectories
are completely excluded from the listing. Only files of suffix
`pdf` in the root of `remote:` or its subdirectories are listed.
The `- **` rule prevents listing of any path/files not previously
matched by the rules above.

Option `exclude-if-present` creates a directory exclude rule based
on the presence of a file in a directory and takes precedence over
other rclone directory filter rules.

When using pattern list syntax, if a pattern item contains either
`/` or `**`, then rclone will not able to imply a directory filter rule
from this pattern list.

E.g. for an include rule

    {dir1/**,dir2/**}

Rclone will match files below directories `dir1` or `dir2` only,
but will not be able to use this filter to exclude a directory `dir3`
from being traversed.

Directory recursion optimisation may affect performance, but normally
not the result. One exception to this is sync operations with option
`--create-empty-src-dirs`, where any traversed empty directories will
be created. With the pattern list example `{dir1/**,dir2/**}` above,
this would create an empty directory `dir3` on destination (when it exists
on source). Changing the filter to `{dir1,dir2}/**`, or splitting it into
two include rules `--include dir1/** --include dir2/**`, will match the
same files while also filtering directories, with the result that an empty
directory `dir3` will no longer be created.

### `--exclude` - Exclude files matching pattern

Excludes path/file names from an rclone command based on a single exclude
rule.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

`--exclude` should not be used with `--include`, `--include-from`,
`--filter` or `--filter-from` flags.

`--exclude` has no effect when combined with `--files-from` or
`--files-from-raw` flags.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --exclude *.bak` excludes all .bak files
from listing.

E.g. `rclone size remote: --exclude "/dir/**"` returns the total size of
all files on `remote:` excluding those in root directory `dir` and sub
directories.

E.g. on Microsoft Windows `rclone ls remote: --exclude "*\[{JP,KR,HK}\]*"`
lists the files in `remote:` without `[JP]` or `[KR]` or `[HK]` in
their name. Quotes prevent the shell from interpreting the `\`
characters.`\` characters escape the `[` and `]` so an rclone filter
treats them literally rather than as a character-range. The `{` and `}`
define an rclone pattern list. For other operating systems single quotes are
required ie `rclone ls remote: --exclude '*\[{JP,KR,HK}\]*'`

### `--exclude-from` - Read exclude patterns from file

Excludes path/file names from an rclone command based on rules in a
named file. The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules.

For an example `exclude-file.txt`:

    # a sample exclude rule file
    *.bak
    file2.jpg

`rclone ls remote: --exclude-from exclude-file.txt` lists the files on
`remote:` except those named `file2.jpg` or with a suffix `.bak`. That is
equivalent to `rclone ls remote: --exclude file2.jpg --exclude "*.bak"`.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

The `--exclude-from` flag is useful where multiple exclude filter rules
are applied to an rclone command.

`--exclude-from` should not be used with `--include`, `--include-from`,
`--filter` or `--filter-from` flags.

`--exclude-from` has no effect when combined with `--files-from` or
`--files-from-raw` flags.

`--exclude-from` followed by `-` reads filter rules from standard input.

### `--include` - Include files matching pattern

Adds a single include rule based on path/file names to an rclone
command.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

`--include` has no effect when combined with `--files-from` or
`--files-from-raw` flags.

`--include` implies `--exclude **` at the end of an rclone internal
filter list. Therefore if you mix `--include` and `--include-from`
flags with `--exclude`, `--exclude-from`, `--filter` or `--filter-from`,
you must use include rules for all the files you want in the include
statement. For more flexibility use the `--filter-from` flag.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --include "*.{png,jpg}"` lists the files on
`remote:` with suffix `.png` and `.jpg`. All other files are excluded.

E.g. multiple rclone copy commands can be combined with `--include` and a
pattern-list.

    rclone copy /vol1/A remote:A
    rclone copy /vol1/B remote:B

is equivalent to:

    rclone copy /vol1 remote: --include "{A,B}/**"

E.g. `rclone ls remote:/wheat --include "??[^[:punct:]]*"` lists the
files `remote:` directory `wheat` (and subdirectories) whose third
character is not punctuation. This example uses
an [ASCII character class](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/).

### `--include-from` - Read include patterns from file

Adds path/file names to an rclone command based on rules in a
named file. The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules.

For an example `include-file.txt`:

    # a sample include rule file
    *.jpg
    file2.avi

`rclone ls remote: --include-from include-file.txt` lists the files on
`remote:` with name `file2.avi` or suffix `.jpg`. That is equivalent to
`rclone ls remote: --include file2.avi --include "*.jpg"`.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

The `--include-from` flag is useful where multiple include filter rules
are applied to an rclone command.

`--include-from` implies `--exclude **` at the end of an rclone internal
filter list. Therefore if you mix `--include` and `--include-from`
flags with `--exclude`, `--exclude-from`, `--filter` or `--filter-from`,
you must use include rules for all the files you want in the include
statement. For more flexibility use the `--filter-from` flag.

`--exclude-from` has no effect when combined with `--files-from` or
`--files-from-raw` flags.

`--exclude-from` followed by `-` reads filter rules from standard input.

### `--filter` - Add a file-filtering rule

Specifies path/file names to an rclone command, based on a single
include or exclude rule, in `+` or `-` format.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

`--filter +` differs from `--include`. In the case of `--include` rclone
implies an `--exclude *` rule which it adds to the bottom of the internal rule
list. `--filter...+` does not imply
that rule.

`--filter` has no effect when combined with `--files-from` or
`--files-from-raw` flags.

`--filter` should not be used with `--include`, `--include-from`,
`--exclude` or `--exclude-from` flags.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --filter "- *.bak"` excludes all `.bak` files
from a list of `remote:`.

### `--filter-from` - Read filtering patterns from a file

Adds path/file names to an rclone command based on rules in a
named file. The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules. Include
rules start with `+ ` and exclude rules with `- `. `!` clears existing
rules. Rules are processed in the order they are defined.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

Arrange the order of filter rules with the most restrictive first and
work down.

E.g. for `filter-file.txt`:

    # a sample filter rule file
    - secret*.jpg
    + *.jpg
    + *.png
    + file2.avi
    - /dir/Trash/**
    + /dir/**
    # exclude everything else
    - *

`rclone ls remote: --filter-from filter-file.txt` lists the path/files on
`remote:` including all `jpg` and `png` files, excluding any
matching `secret*.jpg` and including `file2.avi`.  It also includes
everything in the directory `dir` at the root of `remote`, except
`remote:dir/Trash` which it excludes.  Everything else is excluded.


E.g. for an alternative `filter-file.txt`:

    - secret*.jpg
    + *.jpg
    + *.png
    + file2.avi
    - *

Files `file1.jpg`, `file3.png` and `file2.avi` are listed whilst
`secret17.jpg` and files without the suffix `.jpg` or `.png` are excluded.

E.g. for an alternative `filter-file.txt`:

    + *.jpg
    + *.gif
    !
    + 42.doc
    - *

Only file 42.doc is listed. Prior rules are cleared by the `!`.

### `--files-from` - Read list of source-file names

Adds path/files to an rclone command from a list in a named file.
Rclone processes the path/file names in the order of the list, and
no others.

Other filter flags (`--include`, `--include-from`, `--exclude`,
`--exclude-from`, `--filter` and `--filter-from`) are ignored when
`--files-from` is used.

`--files-from` expects a list of files as its input. Leading or
trailing whitespace is stripped from the input lines. Lines starting
with `#` or `;` are ignored.

Rclone commands with a `--files-from` flag traverse the remote,
treating the names in `--files-from` as a set of filters.

If the `--no-traverse` and `--files-from` flags are used together
an rclone command does not traverse the remote. Instead it addresses
each path/file named in the file individually. For each path/file name, that
requires typically 1 API call. This can be efficient for a short `--files-from`
list and a remote containing many files.

Rclone commands do not error if any names in the `--files-from` file are
missing from the source remote.

The `--files-from` flag can be repeated in a single rclone command to
read path/file names from more than one file. The files are read from left
to right along the command line.

Paths within the `--files-from` file are interpreted as starting
with the root specified in the rclone command.  Leading `/` separators are
ignored. See [--files-from-raw](#files-from-raw-read-list-of-source-file-names-without-any-processing) if
you need the input to be processed in a raw manner.

E.g. for a file `files-from.txt`:

    # comment
    file1.jpg
    subdir/file2.jpg

`rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt /home/me/pics remote:pics`
copies the following, if they exist, and only those files.

    /home/me/pics/file1.jpg        → remote:pics/file1.jpg
    /home/me/pics/subdir/file2.jpg → remote:pics/subdir/file2.jpg

E.g. to copy the following files referenced by their absolute paths:

    /home/user1/42
    /home/user1/dir/ford
    /home/user2/prefect

First find a common subdirectory - in this case `/home`
and put the remaining files in `files-from.txt` with or without
leading `/`, e.g.

    user1/42
    user1/dir/ford
    user2/prefect

Then copy these to a remote:

    rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt /home remote:backup

The three files are transferred as follows:

    /home/user1/42       → remote:backup/user1/important
    /home/user1/dir/ford → remote:backup/user1/dir/file
    /home/user2/prefect  → remote:backup/user2/stuff

Alternatively if `/` is chosen as root `files-from.txt` will be:

    /home/user1/42
    /home/user1/dir/ford
    /home/user2/prefect

The copy command will be:

    rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt / remote:backup

Then there will be an extra `home` directory on the remote:

    /home/user1/42       → remote:backup/home/user1/42
    /home/user1/dir/ford → remote:backup/home/user1/dir/ford
    /home/user2/prefect  → remote:backup/home/user2/prefect

### `--files-from-raw` - Read list of source-file names without any processing

This flag is the same as `--files-from` except that input is read in a
raw manner. Lines with leading / trailing whitespace, and lines starting
with `;` or `#` are read without any processing. [rclone lsf](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsf/) has
a compatible format that can be used to export file lists from remotes for
input to `--files-from-raw`.

### `--ignore-case` - make searches case insensitive

By default, rclone filter patterns are case sensitive. The `--ignore-case`
flag makes all of the filters patterns on the command line case
insensitive.

E.g. `--include "zaphod.txt"` does not match a file `Zaphod.txt`. With
`--ignore-case` a match is made.

## Quoting shell metacharacters

Rclone commands with filter patterns containing shell metacharacters may
not as work as expected in your shell and may require quoting.

E.g. linux, OSX (`*` metacharacter)

  * `--include \*.jpg`
  * `--include '*.jpg'`
  * `--include='*.jpg'`

Microsoft Windows expansion is done by the command, not shell, so
`--include *.jpg` does not require quoting.

If the rclone error
`Command .... needs .... arguments maximum: you provided .... non flag arguments:`
is encountered, the cause is commonly spaces within the name of a
remote or flag value. The fix then is to quote values containing spaces.

## Other filters

### `--min-size` - Don't transfer any file smaller than this

Controls the minimum size file within the scope of an rclone command.
Default units are `KiB` but abbreviations `B`, `K`, `M`, `G`, `T` or `P` are valid.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --min-size 50k` lists files on `remote:` of 50 KiB
size or larger.

See [the size option docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#size-option) for more info.

### `--max-size` - Don't transfer any file larger than this

Controls the maximum size file within the scope of an rclone command.
Default units are `KiB` but abbreviations `B`, `K`, `M`, `G`, `T` or `P` are valid.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --max-size 1G` lists files on `remote:` of 1 GiB
size or smaller.

See [the size option docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#size-option) for more info.

### `--max-age` - Don't transfer any file older than this

Controls the maximum age of files within the scope of an rclone command.

`--max-age` applies only to files and not to directories.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --max-age 2d` lists files on `remote:` of 2 days
old or less.

See [the time option docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#time-option) for valid formats.

### `--min-age` - Don't transfer any file younger than this

Controls the minimum age of files within the scope of an rclone command.
(see `--max-age` for valid formats)

`--min-age` applies only to files and not to directories.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --min-age 2d` lists files on `remote:` of 2 days
old or more.

See [the time option docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#time-option) for valid formats.

## Other flags

### `--delete-excluded` - Delete files on dest excluded from sync

**Important** this flag is dangerous to your data - use with `--dry-run`
and `-v` first.

In conjunction with `rclone sync`, `--delete-excluded` deletes any files
on the destination which are excluded from the command.

E.g. the scope of `rclone sync --interactive A: B:` can be restricted:

    rclone --min-size 50k --delete-excluded sync A: B:

All files on `B:` which are less than 50 KiB are deleted
because they are excluded from the rclone sync command.

### `--dump filters` - dump the filters to the output

Dumps the defined filters to standard output in regular expression
format.

Useful for debugging.

## Exclude directory based on a file

The `--exclude-if-present` flag controls whether a directory is
within the scope of an rclone command based on the presence of a
named file within it. The flag can be repeated to check for
multiple file names, presence of any of them will exclude the
directory.

This flag has a priority over other filter flags.

E.g. for the following directory structure:

    dir1/file1
    dir1/dir2/file2
    dir1/dir2/dir3/file3
    dir1/dir2/dir3/.ignore

The command `rclone ls --exclude-if-present .ignore dir1` does
not list `dir3`, `file3` or `.ignore`.

## Metadata filters {#metadata}

The metadata filters work in a very similar way to the normal file
name filters, except they match [metadata](https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata) on the
object.

The metadata should be specified as `key=value` patterns. This may be
wildcarded using the normal [filter patterns](#patterns) or [regular
expressions](#regexp).

For example if you wished to list only local files with a mode of
`100664` you could do that with:

    rclone lsf -M --files-only --metadata-include "mode=100664" .

Or if you wished to show files with an `atime`, `mtime` or `btime` at a given date:

    rclone lsf -M --files-only --metadata-include "[abm]time=2022-12-16*" .

Like file filtering, metadata filtering only applies to files not to
directories.

The filters can be applied using these flags.

- `--metadata-include`      - Include metadatas matching pattern
- `--metadata-include-from` - Read metadata include patterns from file (use - to read from stdin)
- `--metadata-exclude`      - Exclude metadatas matching pattern
- `--metadata-exclude-from` - Read metadata exclude patterns from file (use - to read from stdin)
- `--metadata-filter`       - Add a metadata filtering rule
- `--metadata-filter-from`  - Read metadata filtering patterns from a file (use - to read from stdin)

Each flag can be repeated. See the section on [how filter rules are
applied](#how-filter-rules-work) for more details - these flags work
in an identical way to the file name filtering flags, but instead of
file name patterns have metadata patterns.


## Common pitfalls

The most frequent filter support issues on
the [rclone forum](https://forum.rclone.org/) are:

* Not using paths relative to the root of the remote
* Not using `/` to match from the root of a remote
* Not using `**` to match the contents of a directory

# GUI (Experimental)

Rclone can serve a web based GUI (graphical user interface).  This is
somewhat experimental at the moment so things may be subject to
change.

Run this command in a terminal and rclone will download and then
display the GUI in a web browser.

```
rclone rcd --rc-web-gui
```

This will produce logs like this and rclone needs to continue to run to serve the GUI:

```
2019/08/25 11:40:14 NOTICE: A new release for gui is present at https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react/releases/download/v0.0.6/currentbuild.zip
2019/08/25 11:40:14 NOTICE: Downloading webgui binary. Please wait. [Size: 3813937, Path :  /home/USER/.cache/rclone/webgui/v0.0.6.zip]
2019/08/25 11:40:16 NOTICE: Unzipping
2019/08/25 11:40:16 NOTICE: Serving remote control on http://127.0.0.1:5572/
```

This assumes you are running rclone locally on your machine.  It is
possible to separate the rclone and the GUI - see below for details.

If you wish to check for updates then you can add `--rc-web-gui-update`
to the command line.

If you find your GUI broken, you may force it to update by add `--rc-web-gui-force-update`.

By default, rclone will open your browser. Add `--rc-web-gui-no-open-browser`
to disable this feature.

## Using the GUI

Once the GUI opens, you will be looking at the dashboard which has an overall overview.

On the left hand side you will see a series of view buttons you can click on:

- Dashboard - main overview
- Configs - examine and create new configurations
- Explorer - view, download and upload files to the cloud storage systems
- Backend - view or alter the backend config
- Log out

(More docs and walkthrough video to come!)

## How it works

When you run the `rclone rcd --rc-web-gui` this is what happens

- Rclone starts but only runs the remote control API ("rc").
- The API is bound to localhost with an auto-generated username and password.
- If the API bundle is missing then rclone will download it.
- rclone will start serving the files from the API bundle over the same port as the API
- rclone will open the browser with a `login_token` so it can log straight in.

## Advanced use

The `rclone rcd` may use any of the [flags documented on the rc page](https://rclone.org/rc/#supported-parameters).

The flag `--rc-web-gui` is shorthand for

- Download the web GUI if necessary
- Check we are using some authentication
- `--rc-user gui`
- `--rc-pass <random password>`
- `--rc-serve`

These flags can be overridden as desired.

See also the [rclone rcd documentation](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rcd/).

### Example: Running a public GUI

For example the GUI could be served on a public port over SSL using an htpasswd file using the following flags:

- `--rc-web-gui`
- `--rc-addr :443`
- `--rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd`
- `--rc-cert /path/to/ssl.crt`
- `--rc-key /path/to/ssl.key`

### Example: Running a GUI behind a proxy

If you want to run the GUI behind a proxy at `/rclone` you could use these flags:

- `--rc-web-gui`
- `--rc-baseurl rclone`
- `--rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd`

Or instead of htpasswd if you just want a single user and password:

- `--rc-user me`
- `--rc-pass mypassword`

## Project

The GUI is being developed in the: [rclone/rclone-webui-react repository](https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react).

Bug reports and contributions are very welcome :-)

If you have questions then please ask them on the [rclone forum](https://forum.rclone.org/).

# Remote controlling rclone with its API

If rclone is run with the `--rc` flag then it starts an HTTP server
which can be used to remote control rclone using its API.

You can either use the [rc](#api-rc) command to access the API
or [use HTTP directly](#api-http).

If you just want to run a remote control then see the [rcd](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rcd/) command.

## Supported parameters

### --rc

Flag to start the http server listen on remote requests
      
### --rc-addr=IP

IPaddress:Port or :Port to bind server to. (default "localhost:5572")

### --rc-cert=KEY
SSL PEM key (concatenation of certificate and CA certificate)

### --rc-client-ca=PATH
Client certificate authority to verify clients with

### --rc-htpasswd=PATH

htpasswd file - if not provided no authentication is done

### --rc-key=PATH

SSL PEM Private key

### --rc-max-header-bytes=VALUE

Maximum size of request header (default 4096)

### --rc-min-tls-version=VALUE

The minimum TLS version that is acceptable. Valid values are "tls1.0",
"tls1.1", "tls1.2" and "tls1.3" (default "tls1.0").

### --rc-user=VALUE

User name for authentication.

### --rc-pass=VALUE

Password for authentication.

### --rc-realm=VALUE

Realm for authentication (default "rclone")

### --rc-server-read-timeout=DURATION

Timeout for server reading data (default 1h0m0s)

### --rc-server-write-timeout=DURATION

Timeout for server writing data (default 1h0m0s)

### --rc-serve

Enable the serving of remote objects via the HTTP interface.  This
means objects will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5572/ by default,
so you can browse to http://127.0.0.1:5572/ or http://127.0.0.1:5572/*
to see a listing of the remotes.  Objects may be requested from
remotes using this syntax http://127.0.0.1:5572/[remote:path]/path/to/object

Default Off.

### --rc-serve-no-modtime

Set this flag to skip reading the modification time (can speed things up).

Default Off.

### --rc-files /path/to/directory

Path to local files to serve on the HTTP server.

If this is set then rclone will serve the files in that directory.  It
will also open the root in the web browser if specified.  This is for
implementing browser based GUIs for rclone functions.

If `--rc-user` or `--rc-pass` is set then the URL that is opened will
have the authorization in the URL in the `http://user:pass@localhost/`
style.

Default Off.

### --rc-enable-metrics

Enable OpenMetrics/Prometheus compatible endpoint at `/metrics`.
If more control over the metrics is desired (for example running it on a different port or with different auth) then endpoint can be enabled with the `--metrics-*` flags instead.

Default Off.

### --rc-web-gui

Set this flag to serve the default web gui on the same port as rclone.

Default Off.

### --rc-allow-origin

Set the allowed Access-Control-Allow-Origin for rc requests.

Can be used with --rc-web-gui if the rclone is running on different IP than the web-gui.

Default is IP address on which rc is running.

### --rc-web-fetch-url

Set the URL to fetch the rclone-web-gui files from.

Default https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone-webui-react/releases/latest.

### --rc-web-gui-update

Set this flag to check and update rclone-webui-react from the rc-web-fetch-url.

Default Off.

### --rc-web-gui-force-update

Set this flag to force update rclone-webui-react from the rc-web-fetch-url.

Default Off.

### --rc-web-gui-no-open-browser

Set this flag to disable opening browser automatically when using web-gui.

Default Off.

### --rc-job-expire-duration=DURATION

Expire finished async jobs older than DURATION (default 60s).

### --rc-job-expire-interval=DURATION

Interval duration to check for expired async jobs (default 10s).

### --rc-no-auth

By default rclone will require authorisation to have been set up on
the rc interface in order to use any methods which access any rclone
remotes.  Eg `operations/list` is denied as it involved creating a
remote as is `sync/copy`.

If this is set then no authorisation will be required on the server to
use these methods.  The alternative is to use `--rc-user` and
`--rc-pass` and use these credentials in the request.

Default Off.

### --rc-baseurl

Prefix for URLs.

Default is root

### --rc-template

User-specified template.

## Accessing the remote control via the rclone rc command {#api-rc}

Rclone itself implements the remote control protocol in its `rclone
rc` command.

You can use it like this

```
$ rclone rc rc/noop param1=one param2=two
{
	"param1": "one",
	"param2": "two"
}
```

Run `rclone rc` on its own to see the help for the installed remote
control commands.

## JSON input

`rclone rc` also supports a `--json` flag which can be used to send
more complicated input parameters.

```
$ rclone rc --json '{ "p1": [1,"2",null,4], "p2": { "a":1, "b":2 } }' rc/noop
{
	"p1": [
		1,
		"2",
		null,
		4
	],
	"p2": {
		"a": 1,
		"b": 2
	}
}
```

If the parameter being passed is an object then it can be passed as a
JSON string rather than using the `--json` flag which simplifies the
command line.

```
rclone rc operations/list fs=/tmp remote=test opt='{"showHash": true}'
```

Rather than

```
rclone rc operations/list --json '{"fs": "/tmp", "remote": "test", "opt": {"showHash": true}}'
```

## Special parameters

The rc interface supports some special parameters which apply to
**all** commands.  These start with `_` to show they are different.

### Running asynchronous jobs with _async = true

Each rc call is classified as a job and it is assigned its own id. By default
jobs are executed immediately as they are created or synchronously.

If `_async` has a true value when supplied to an rc call then it will
return immediately with a job id and the task will be run in the
background.  The `job/status` call can be used to get information of
the background job.  The job can be queried for up to 1 minute after
it has finished.

It is recommended that potentially long running jobs, e.g. `sync/sync`,
`sync/copy`, `sync/move`, `operations/purge` are run with the `_async`
flag to avoid any potential problems with the HTTP request and
response timing out.

Starting a job with the `_async` flag:

```
$ rclone rc --json '{ "p1": [1,"2",null,4], "p2": { "a":1, "b":2 }, "_async": true }' rc/noop
{
	"jobid": 2
}
```

Query the status to see if the job has finished.  For more information
on the meaning of these return parameters see the `job/status` call.

```
$ rclone rc --json '{ "jobid":2 }' job/status
{
	"duration": 0.000124163,
	"endTime": "2018-10-27T11:38:07.911245881+01:00",
	"error": "",
	"finished": true,
	"id": 2,
	"output": {
		"_async": true,
		"p1": [
			1,
			"2",
			null,
			4
		],
		"p2": {
			"a": 1,
			"b": 2
		}
	},
	"startTime": "2018-10-27T11:38:07.911121728+01:00",
	"success": true
}
```

`job/list` can be used to show the running or recently completed jobs

```
$ rclone rc job/list
{
	"jobids": [
		2
	]
}
```

### Setting config flags with _config

If you wish to set config (the equivalent of the global flags) for the
duration of an rc call only then pass in the `_config` parameter.

This should be in the same format as the `config` key returned by
[options/get](#options-get).

For example, if you wished to run a sync with the `--checksum`
parameter, you would pass this parameter in your JSON blob.

    "_config":{"CheckSum": true}

If using `rclone rc` this could be passed as

    rclone rc sync/sync ... _config='{"CheckSum": true}'

Any config parameters you don't set will inherit the global defaults
which were set with command line flags or environment variables.

Note that it is possible to set some values as strings or integers -
see [data types](#data-types) for more info. Here is an example
setting the equivalent of `--buffer-size` in string or integer format.

    "_config":{"BufferSize": "42M"}
    "_config":{"BufferSize": 44040192}

If you wish to check the `_config` assignment has worked properly then
calling `options/local` will show what the value got set to.

### Setting filter flags with _filter

If you wish to set filters for the duration of an rc call only then
pass in the `_filter` parameter.

This should be in the same format as the `filter` key returned by
[options/get](#options-get).

For example, if you wished to run a sync with these flags

    --max-size 1M --max-age 42s --include "a" --include "b"

you would pass this parameter in your JSON blob.

    "_filter":{"MaxSize":"1M", "IncludeRule":["a","b"], "MaxAge":"42s"}

If using `rclone rc` this could be passed as

    rclone rc ... _filter='{"MaxSize":"1M", "IncludeRule":["a","b"], "MaxAge":"42s"}'

Any filter parameters you don't set will inherit the global defaults
which were set with command line flags or environment variables.

Note that it is possible to set some values as strings or integers -
see [data types](#data-types) for more info. Here is an example
setting the equivalent of `--buffer-size` in string or integer format.

    "_filter":{"MinSize": "42M"}
    "_filter":{"MinSize": 44040192}

If you wish to check the `_filter` assignment has worked properly then
calling `options/local` will show what the value got set to.

### Assigning operations to groups with _group = value

Each rc call has its own stats group for tracking its metrics. By default
grouping is done by the composite group name from prefix `job/` and  id of the
job like so `job/1`.

If `_group` has a value then stats for that request will be grouped under that
value. This allows caller to group stats under their own name.

Stats for specific group can be accessed by passing `group` to `core/stats`:

```
$ rclone rc --json '{ "group": "job/1" }' core/stats
{
	"speed": 12345
	...
}
```

## Data types {#data-types}

When the API returns types, these will mostly be straight forward
integer, string or boolean types.

However some of the types returned by the [options/get](#options-get)
call and taken by the [options/set](#options-set) calls as well as the
`vfsOpt`, `mountOpt` and the `_config` parameters.

- `Duration` - these are returned as an integer duration in
  nanoseconds. They may be set as an integer, or they may be set with
  time string, eg "5s". See the [options section](https://rclone.org/docs/#options) for
  more info.
- `Size` - these are returned as an integer number of bytes. They may
  be set as an integer or they may be set with a size suffix string,
  eg "10M". See the [options section](https://rclone.org/docs/#options) for more info.
- Enumerated type (such as `CutoffMode`, `DumpFlags`, `LogLevel`,
  `VfsCacheMode` - these will be returned as an integer and may be set
  as an integer but more conveniently they can be set as a string, eg
  "HARD" for `CutoffMode` or `DEBUG` for `LogLevel`.
- `BandwidthSpec` - this will be set and returned as a string, eg
  "1M".

### Option blocks {#option-blocks}

The calls [options/info](#options-info) (for the main config) and
[config/providers](#config-providers) (for the backend config) may be
used to get information on the rclone configuration options. This can
be used to build user interfaces for displaying and setting any rclone
option.

These consist of arrays of `Option` blocks. These have the following
format. Each block describes a single option.

| Field | Type | Optional | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| Name       | string     | N | name of the option in snake_case |
| FieldName  | string     | N | name of the field used in the rc - if blank use Name |
| Help       | string     | N | help, started with a single sentence on a single line |
| Groups     | string     | Y | groups this option belongs to - comma separated string for options classification |
| Provider   | string     | Y | set to filter on provider |
| Default    | any        | N | default value, if set (and not to nil or "") then Required does nothing |
| Value      | any        | N | value to be set by flags |
| Examples   | Examples   | Y | predefined values that can be selected from list (multiple-choice option) |
| ShortOpt   | string     | Y | the short command line option for this |
| Hide       | Visibility | N | if non zero, this option is hidden from the configurator or the command line |
| Required   | bool       | N | this option is required, meaning value cannot be empty unless there is a default |
| IsPassword | bool       | N | set if the option is a password |
| NoPrefix   | bool       | N | set if the option for this should not use the backend prefix |
| Advanced   | bool       | N | set if this is an advanced config option |
| Exclusive  | bool       | N | set if the answer can only be one of the examples (empty string allowed unless Required or Default is set) |
| Sensitive  | bool       | N | set if this option should be redacted when using `rclone config redacted` |

An example of this might be the `--log-level` flag. Note that the
`Name` of the option becomes the command line flag with `_` replaced
with `-`.

```
{
    "Advanced": false,
    "Default": 5,
    "DefaultStr": "NOTICE",
    "Examples": [
        {
            "Help": "",
            "Value": "EMERGENCY"
        },
        {
            "Help": "",
            "Value": "ALERT"
        },
        ...
    ],
    "Exclusive": true,
    "FieldName": "LogLevel",
    "Groups": "Logging",
    "Help": "Log level DEBUG|INFO|NOTICE|ERROR",
    "Hide": 0,
    "IsPassword": false,
    "Name": "log_level",
    "NoPrefix": true,
    "Required": true,
    "Sensitive": false,
    "Type": "LogLevel",
    "Value": null,
    "ValueStr": "NOTICE"
},
```

Note that the `Help` may be multiple lines separated by `\n`. The
first line will always be a short sentence and this is the sentence
shown when running `rclone help flags`.

## Specifying remotes to work on

Remotes are specified with the `fs=`, `srcFs=`, `dstFs=`
parameters depending on the command being used.

The parameters can be a string as per the rest of rclone, eg
`s3:bucket/path` or `:sftp:/my/dir`. They can also be specified as
JSON blobs.

If specifying a JSON blob it should be a object mapping strings to
strings. These values will be used to configure the remote. There are
3 special values which may be set:

- `type` -  set to `type` to specify a remote called `:type:`
- `_name` - set to `name` to specify a remote called `name:`
- `_root` - sets the root of the remote - may be empty

One of `_name` or `type` should normally be set. If the `local`
backend is desired then `type` should be set to `local`. If `_root`
isn't specified then it defaults to the root of the remote.

For example this JSON is equivalent to `remote:/tmp`

```
{
    "_name": "remote",
    "_root": "/tmp"
}
```

And this is equivalent to `:sftp,host='example.com':/tmp`

```
{
    "type": "sftp",
    "host": "example.com",
    "_root": "/tmp"
}
```

And this is equivalent to `/tmp/dir`

```
{
    type = "local",
    _root = "/tmp/dir"
}
```

## Supported commands

### backend/command: Runs a backend command. {#backend-command}

This takes the following parameters:

- command - a string with the command name
- fs - a remote name string e.g. "drive:"
- arg - a list of arguments for the backend command
- opt - a map of string to string of options

Returns:

- result - result from the backend command

Example:

    rclone rc backend/command command=noop fs=. -o echo=yes -o blue -a path1 -a path2

Returns

```
{
	"result": {
		"arg": [
			"path1",
			"path2"
		],
		"name": "noop",
		"opt": {
			"blue": "",
			"echo": "yes"
		}
	}
}
```

Note that this is the direct equivalent of using this "backend"
command:

    rclone backend noop . -o echo=yes -o blue path1 path2

Note that arguments must be preceded by the "-a" flag

See the [backend](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more information.

**Authentication is required for this call.**

### cache/expire: Purge a remote from cache {#cache-expire}

Purge a remote from the cache backend. Supports either a directory or a file.
Params:
  - remote = path to remote (required)
  - withData = true/false to delete cached data (chunks) as well (optional)

Eg

    rclone rc cache/expire remote=path/to/sub/folder/
    rclone rc cache/expire remote=/ withData=true

### cache/fetch: Fetch file chunks {#cache-fetch}

Ensure the specified file chunks are cached on disk.

The chunks= parameter specifies the file chunks to check.
It takes a comma separated list of array slice indices.
The slice indices are similar to Python slices: start[:end]

start is the 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the file
to fetch inclusive. end is 0 based chunk number from the beginning
of the file to fetch exclusive.
Both values can be negative, in which case they count from the back
of the file. The value "-5:" represents the last 5 chunks of a file.

Some valid examples are:
":5,-5:" -> the first and last five chunks
"0,-2" -> the first and the second last chunk
"0:10" -> the first ten chunks

Any parameter with a key that starts with "file" can be used to
specify files to fetch, e.g.

    rclone rc cache/fetch chunks=0 file=hello file2=home/goodbye

File names will automatically be encrypted when the a crypt remote
is used on top of the cache.

    - The STREAM returnTypes will write the output to the body of the HTTP message.
    - The COMBINED_OUTPUT will write the output to the "result" parameter.

Returns:

- result - result from the backend command.
    - Only set when using returnType "COMBINED_OUTPUT".
- error	 - set if rclone exits with an error code.
- returnType - one of ("COMBINED_OUTPUT", "STREAM", "STREAM_ONLY_STDOUT", "STREAM_ONLY_STDERR").

Returns:

```
{
	"dir": "/",
	"info": {
		"Available": 361769115648,

are explained in the go docs: https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#MemStats

The most interesting values for most people are:

- HeapAlloc - this is the amount of memory rclone is actually using
- HeapSys - this is the amount of memory rclone has obtained from the OS
- Sys - this is the total amount of memory requested from the OS
   - It is virtual memory so may include unused memory

### core/obscure: Obscures a string passed in. {#core-obscure}

### debug/set-block-profile-rate: Set runtime.SetBlockProfileRate for blocking profiling. {#debug-set-block-profile-rate}

SetBlockProfileRate controls the fraction of goroutine blocking events
that are reported in the blocking profile. The profiler aims to sample
an average of one blocking event per rate nanoseconds spent blocked.

To include every blocking event in the profile, pass rate = 1. To turn
off profiling entirely, pass rate <= 0.

After calling this you can use this to see the blocking profile:

    go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/block

Parameters:

- rate - int

### debug/set-gc-percent: Call runtime/debug.SetGCPercent for setting the garbage collection target percentage. {#debug-set-gc-percent}

SetGCPercent sets the garbage collection target percentage: a collection is triggered
when the ratio of freshly allocated data to live data remaining after the previous collection
reaches this percentage. SetGCPercent returns the previous setting. The initial setting is the
value of the GOGC environment variable at startup, or 100 if the variable is not set.

This setting may be effectively reduced in order to maintain a memory limit.
A negative percentage effectively disables garbage collection, unless the memory limit is reached.

See https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/debug#SetMemoryLimit for more details.

Parameters:

- gc-percent - int

### debug/set-mutex-profile-fraction: Set runtime.SetMutexProfileFraction for mutex profiling. {#debug-set-mutex-profile-fraction}

SetMutexProfileFraction controls the fraction of mutex contention
events that are reported in the mutex profile. On average 1/rate
events are reported. The previous rate is returned.

To turn off profiling entirely, pass rate 0. To just read the current
rate, pass rate < 0. (For n>1 the details of sampling may change.)

Once this is set you can look use this to profile the mutex contention:

    go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/mutex

Parameters:

- rate - int

Results:

- previousRate - int

### debug/set-soft-memory-limit: Call runtime/debug.SetMemoryLimit for setting a soft memory limit for the runtime. {#debug-set-soft-memory-limit}

SetMemoryLimit provides the runtime with a soft memory limit.

The runtime undertakes several processes to try to respect this memory limit, including
adjustments to the frequency of garbage collections and returning memory to the underlying
system more aggressively. This limit will be respected even if GOGC=off (or, if SetGCPercent(-1) is executed).

The input limit is provided as bytes, and includes all memory mapped, managed, and not
released by the Go runtime. Notably, it does not account for space used by the Go binary
and memory external to Go, such as memory managed by the underlying system on behalf of
the process, or memory managed by non-Go code inside the same process.
Examples of excluded memory sources include: OS kernel memory held on behalf of the process,
memory allocated by C code, and memory mapped by syscall.Mmap (because it is not managed by the Go runtime).

A zero limit or a limit that's lower than the amount of memory used by the Go runtime may cause
the garbage collector to run nearly continuously. However, the application may still make progress.

The memory limit is always respected by the Go runtime, so to effectively disable this behavior,
set the limit very high. math.MaxInt64 is the canonical value for disabling the limit, but values
much greater than the available memory on the underlying system work just as well.

See https://go.dev/doc/gc-guide for a detailed guide explaining the soft memory limit in more detail,
as well as a variety of common use-cases and scenarios.

SetMemoryLimit returns the previously set memory limit. A negative input does not adjust the limit,
and allows for retrieval of the currently set memory limit.

Parameters:

- mem-limit - int

### fscache/clear: Clear the Fs cache. {#fscache-clear}

This clears the fs cache. This is where remotes created from backends
are cached for a short while to make repeated rc calls more efficient.

If you change the parameters of a backend then you may want to call
this to clear an existing remote out of the cache before re-creating
it.

**Authentication is required for this call.**

    rclone rc mount/mount fs=TestDrive: mountPoint=/mnt/tmp vfsOpt='{"CacheMode": 2}' mountOpt='{"AllowOther": true}'

The vfsOpt are as described in options/get and can be seen in the the
"vfs" section when running and the mountOpt can be seen in the "mount" section:

    rclone rc options/get

**Authentication is required for this call.**

### mount/types: Show all possible mount types {#mount-types}

This shows all possible mount types and returns them as a list.

This takes no parameters and returns

This takes the following parameters:

- fs - a remote name string e.g. "drive:"

The result is as returned from rclone about --json

See the [about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/) command for more information on the above.

**Authentication is required for this call.**

### operations/check: check the source and destination are the same {#operations-check}

Checks the files in the source and destination match.  It compares
sizes and hashes and logs a report of files that don't
match.  It doesn't alter the source or destination.

This takes the following parameters:

- srcFs - a remote name string e.g. "drive:" for the source, "/" for local filesystem
- dstFs - a remote name string e.g. "drive2:" for the destination, "/" for local filesystem
- download - check by downloading rather than with hash
- checkFileHash - treat checkFileFs:checkFileRemote as a SUM file with hashes of given type
- checkFileFs - treat checkFileFs:checkFileRemote as a SUM file with hashes of given type
- checkFileRemote - treat checkFileFs:checkFileRemote as a SUM file with hashes of given type
- oneWay -  check one way only, source files must exist on remote
- combined - make a combined report of changes (default false)
- missingOnSrc - report all files missing from the source (default true)
- missingOnDst - report all files missing from the destination (default true)
- match - report all matching files (default false)
- differ - report all non-matching files (default true)
- error - report all files with errors (hashing or reading) (default true)

If you supply the download flag, it will download the data from
both remotes and check them against each other on the fly.  This can
be useful for remotes that don't support hashes or if you really want
to check all the data.

If you supply the size-only global flag, it will only compare the sizes not
the hashes as well.  Use this for a quick check.

If you supply the checkFileHash option with a valid hash name, the
checkFileFs:checkFileRemote must point to a text file in the SUM
format. This treats the checksum file as the source and dstFs as the
destination. Note that srcFs is not used and should not be supplied in
this case.

Returns:

- success - true if no error, false otherwise
- status - textual summary of check, OK or text string
- hashType - hash used in check, may be missing
- combined - array of strings of combined report of changes
- missingOnSrc - array of strings of all files missing from the source
- missingOnDst - array of strings of all files missing from the destination
- match - array of strings of all matching files
- differ - array of strings of all non-matching files
- error - array of strings of all files with errors (hashing or reading)

### operations/hashsum: Produces a hashsum file for all the objects in the path. {#operations-hashsum}

Produces a hash file for all the objects in the path using the hash
named.  The output is in the same format as the standard
md5sum/sha1sum tool.

This takes the following parameters:

- fs - a remote name string e.g. "drive:" for the source, "/" for local filesystem
    - this can point to a file and just that file will be returned in the listing.
- hashType - type of hash to be used
- download - check by downloading rather than with hash (boolean)
- base64 - output the hashes in base64 rather than hex (boolean)

If you supply the download flag, it will download the data from the
remote and create the hash on the fly. This can be useful for remotes
that don't support the given hash or if you really want to check all
the data.

Note that if you wish to supply a checkfile to check hashes against
the current files then you should use operations/check instead of
operations/hashsum.

Returns:

- hashsum - array of strings of the hashes
- hashType - type of hash used

Example:

    $ rclone rc --loopback operations/hashsum fs=bin hashType=MD5 download=true base64=true
    {
        "hashType": "md5",
        "hashsum": [

**Authentication is required for this call.**

### operations/size: Count the number of bytes and files in remote {#operations-size}

This takes the following parameters:

- fs - a remote name string e.g. "drive:path/to/dir"

Returns:

- count - number of files
- bytes - number of bytes in those files

See the [size](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_size/) command for more information on the above.

**Authentication is required for this call.**

### operations/stat: Give information about the supplied file or directory {#operations-stat}

This takes the following parameters

- fs - a remote name string eg "drive:"
- remote - a path within that remote eg "dir"
- opt - a dictionary of options to control the listing (optional)
    - see operations/list for the options

The result is

- item - an object as described in the lsjson command. Will be null if not found.

Note that if you are only interested in files then it is much more
efficient to set the filesOnly flag in the options.

See the [lsjson](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsjson/) command for more information on the above and examples.

**Authentication is required for this call.**

### operations/uploadfile: Upload file using multiform/form-data {#operations-uploadfile}

This takes the following parameters:

- fs - a remote name string e.g. "drive:"
- remote - a path within that remote e.g. "dir"
- each part in body represents a file to be uploaded

See the [uploadfile](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_uploadfile/) command for more information on the above.

**Authentication is required for this call.**

### options/blocks: List all the option blocks {#options-blocks}

Returns:
- options - a list of the options block names

### options/get: Get all the global options {#options-get}

Returns an object where keys are option block names and values are an
object with the current option values in.

Parameters:

- blocks: optional string of comma separated blocks to include
    - all are included if this is missing or ""

Note that these are the global options which are unaffected by use of
the _config and _filter parameters. If you wish to read the parameters
set in _config then use options/config and for _filter use options/filter.

This shows the internal names of the option within rclone which should
map to the external options very easily with a few exceptions.

### options/info: Get info about all the global options {#options-info}

Returns an object where keys are option block names and values are an
array of objects with info about each options.

Parameters:

- blocks: optional string of comma separated blocks to include
    - all are included if this is missing or ""

These objects are in the same format as returned by "config/providers". They are
described in the [option blocks](#option-blocks) section.

### options/local: Get the currently active config for this call {#options-local}

Returns an object with the keys "config" and "filter".
The "config" key contains the local config and the "filter" key contains
the local filters.

Note that these are the local options specific to this rc call. If
_config was not supplied then they will be the global options.
Likewise with "_filter".

This call is mostly useful for seeing if _config and _filter passing
is working.

This shows the internal names of the option within rclone which should
map to the external options very easily with a few exceptions.

### options/set: Set an option {#options-set}

Parameters:

- option block name containing an object with
  - key: value

Repeated as often as required.

Only supply the options you wish to change.  If an option is unknown
it will be silently ignored.  Not all options will have an effect when
changed like this.

For example:

This sets DEBUG level logs (-vv) (these can be set by number or string)

    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": "DEBUG"}}'
    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": 8}}'

And this sets INFO level logs (-v)

    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": "INFO"}}'

And this sets NOTICE level logs (normal without -v)

    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": "NOTICE"}}'

### pluginsctl/addPlugin: Add a plugin using url {#pluginsctl-addPlugin}

purposes.  It can be used to check that rclone is still alive and to
check that parameter passing is working properly.

### rc/noopauth: Echo the input to the output parameters requiring auth {#rc-noopauth}

This echoes the input parameters to the output parameters for testing
purposes.  It can be used to check that rclone is still alive and to
check that parameter passing is working properly.

**Authentication is required for this call.**

See the [sync](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/) command for more information on the above.

**Authentication is required for this call.**

### vfs/forget: Forget files or directories in the directory cache. {#vfs-forget}

This forgets the paths in the directory cache causing them to be
re-read from the remote when needed.

If no paths are passed in then it will forget all the paths in the
directory cache.

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Otherwise pass files or dirs in as file=path or dir=path.  Any
parameter key starting with file will forget that file and any
starting with dir will forget that dir, e.g.

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=hello file2=goodbye dir=home/junk
 
This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not
supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be
used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter
must be supplied.

### vfs/list: List active VFSes. {#vfs-list}

This lists the active VFSes.

It returns a list under the key "vfses" where the values are the VFS
names that could be passed to the other VFS commands in the "fs"
parameter.

### vfs/poll-interval: Get the status or update the value of the poll-interval option. {#vfs-poll-interval}

Without any parameter given this returns the current status of the
poll-interval setting.

When the interval=duration parameter is set, the poll-interval value
is updated and the polling function is notified.
Setting interval=0 disables poll-interval.

    rclone rc vfs/poll-interval interval=5m

The timeout=duration parameter can be used to specify a time to wait
for the current poll function to apply the new value.
If timeout is less or equal 0, which is the default, wait indefinitely.

The new poll-interval value will only be active when the timeout is
not reached.

If poll-interval is updated or disabled temporarily, some changes
might not get picked up by the polling function, depending on the
used remote.
 
This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not
supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be
used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter
must be supplied.

### vfs/queue: Queue info for a VFS. {#vfs-queue}

This returns info about the upload queue for the selected VFS.

This is only useful if `--vfs-cache-mode` > off. If you call it when
the `--vfs-cache-mode` is off, it will return an empty result.

    {
        "queued": // an array of files queued for upload
        [
            {
                "name":      "file",   // string: name (full path) of the file,
                "id":        123,      // integer: id of this item in the queue,
                "size":      79,       // integer: size of the file in bytes
                "expiry":    1.5       // float: time until file is eligible for transfer, lowest goes first
                "tries":     1,        // integer: number of times we have tried to upload
                "delay":     5.0,      // float: seconds between upload attempts
                "uploading": false,    // boolean: true if item is being uploaded
            },
       ],
    }

The `expiry` time is the time until the file is elegible for being
uploaded in floating point seconds. This may go negative. As rclone
only transfers `--transfers` files at once, only the lowest
`--transfers` expiry times will have `uploading` as `true`. So there
may be files with negative expiry times for which `uploading` is
`false`.

 
This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not
supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be
used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter
must be supplied.

### vfs/queue-set-expiry: Set the expiry time for an item queued for upload. {#vfs-queue-set-expiry}

Use this to adjust the `expiry` time for an item in the upload queue.
You will need to read the `id` of the item using `vfs/queue` before
using this call.

You can then set `expiry` to a floating point number of seconds from
now when the item is eligible for upload. If you want the item to be
uploaded as soon as possible then set it to a large negative number (eg
-1000000000). If you want the upload of the item to be delayed
for a long time then set it to a large positive number.

Setting the `expiry` of an item which has already has started uploading
will have no effect - the item will carry on being uploaded.

This will return an error if called with `--vfs-cache-mode` off or if
the `id` passed is not found.

This takes the following parameters

- `fs` - select the VFS in use (optional)
- `id` - a numeric ID as returned from `vfs/queue`
- `expiry` - a new expiry time as floating point seconds

This returns an empty result on success, or an error.

 
This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not
supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be
used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter
must be supplied.

### vfs/refresh: Refresh the directory cache. {#vfs-refresh}

This reads the directories for the specified paths and freshens the
directory cache.

If no paths are passed in then it will refresh the root directory.

    rclone rc vfs/refresh

Otherwise pass directories in as dir=path. Any parameter key
starting with dir will refresh that directory, e.g.

    rclone rc vfs/refresh dir=home/junk dir2=data/misc

If the parameter recursive=true is given the whole directory tree
will get refreshed. This refresh will use --fast-list if enabled.
 
This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not
supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be
used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter
must be supplied.

### vfs/stats: Stats for a VFS. {#vfs-stats}

This returns stats for the selected VFS.

    {
        // Status of the disk cache - only present if --vfs-cache-mode > off
        "diskCache": {
            "bytesUsed": 0,
            "erroredFiles": 0,
            "files": 0,
            "hashType": 1,
            "outOfSpace": false,
            "path": "/home/user/.cache/rclone/vfs/local/mnt/a",
            "pathMeta": "/home/user/.cache/rclone/vfsMeta/local/mnt/a",
            "uploadsInProgress": 0,
            "uploadsQueued": 0
        },
        "fs": "/mnt/a",
        "inUse": 1,
        // Status of the in memory metadata cache
        "metadataCache": {
            "dirs": 1,
            "files": 0
        },
        // Options as returned by options/get
        "opt": {
            "CacheMaxAge": 3600000000000,
            // ...
            "WriteWait": 1000000000
        }
    }

 
This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not
supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be
used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter
must be supplied.



## Accessing the remote control via HTTP {#api-http}

Rclone implements a simple HTTP based protocol.

Each endpoint takes an JSON object and returns a JSON object or an
error.  The JSON objects are essentially a map of string names to
values.

All calls must made using POST.

The input objects can be supplied using URL parameters, POST
parameters or by supplying "Content-Type: application/json" and a JSON
blob in the body.  There are examples of these below using `curl`.

The response will be a JSON blob in the body of the response.  This is
formatted to be reasonably human-readable.

### Error returns

If an error occurs then there will be an HTTP error status (e.g. 500)
and the body of the response will contain a JSON encoded error object,
e.g.

```
{
    "error": "Expecting string value for key \"remote\" (was float64)",
    "input": {
        "fs": "/tmp",
        "remote": 3
    },
    "status": 400
    "path": "operations/rmdir",
}
```

The keys in the error response are
- error - error string
- input - the input parameters to the call
- status - the HTTP status code
- path - the path of the call

### CORS

The sever implements basic CORS support and allows all origins for that.
The response to a preflight OPTIONS request will echo the requested "Access-Control-Request-Headers" back.

### Using POST with URL parameters only

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5572/rc/noop?potato=1&sausage=2'
```

Response

```
{
	"potato": "1",
	"sausage": "2"
}
```

Here is what an error response looks like:

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5572/rc/error?potato=1&sausage=2'
```

```
{
	"error": "arbitrary error on input map[potato:1 sausage:2]",
	"input": {
		"potato": "1",
		"sausage": "2"
	}
}
```

Note that curl doesn't return errors to the shell unless you use the `-f` option

```
$ curl -f -X POST 'http://localhost:5572/rc/error?potato=1&sausage=2'
curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 400 Bad Request
$ echo $?
22
```

### Using POST with a form

```
curl --data "potato=1" --data "sausage=2" http://localhost:5572/rc/noop
```

Response

```
{
	"potato": "1",
	"sausage": "2"
}
```

Note that you can combine these with URL parameters too with the POST
parameters taking precedence.

```
curl --data "potato=1" --data "sausage=2" "http://localhost:5572/rc/noop?rutabaga=3&sausage=4"
```

Response

```
{
	"potato": "1",
	"rutabaga": "3",
	"sausage": "4"
}

```

### Using POST with a JSON blob

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"potato":2,"sausage":1}' http://localhost:5572/rc/noop
```

response

```
{
	"password": "xyz",
	"username": "xyz"
}
```

This can be combined with URL parameters too if required.  The JSON
blob takes precedence.

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"potato":2,"sausage":1}' 'http://localhost:5572/rc/noop?rutabaga=3&potato=4'
```

```
{
	"potato": 2,
	"rutabaga": "3",
	"sausage": 1
}
```

## Debugging rclone with pprof ##

If you use the `--rc` flag this will also enable the use of the go
profiling tools on the same port.

To use these, first [install go](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Debugging memory use

To profile rclone's memory use you can run:

    go tool pprof -web http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap

This should open a page in your browser showing what is using what
memory.

You can also use the `-text` flag to produce a textual summary

```
$ go tool pprof -text http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap

### Debugging go routine leaks

Memory leaks are most often caused by go routine leaks keeping memory
alive which should have been garbage collected.

See all active go routines using

    curl http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1

Or go to http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1 in your browser.

### Other profiles to look at

You can see a summary of profiles available at http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/

Here is how to use some of them:

- Memory: `go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap`
- Go routines: `curl http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1`
- 30-second CPU profile: `go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/profile`
- 5-second execution trace: `wget http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/trace?seconds=5`
- Goroutine blocking profile
    - Enable first with: `rclone rc debug/set-block-profile-rate rate=1` ([docs](#debug-set-block-profile-rate))
    - `go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/block`
- Contended mutexes:
    - Enable first with: `rclone rc debug/set-mutex-profile-fraction rate=1` ([docs](#debug-set-mutex-profile-fraction))
    - `go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/mutex`

See the [net/http/pprof docs](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/)
for more info on how to use the profiling and for a general overview
see [the Go team's blog post on profiling go programs](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs).

The profiling hook is [zero overhead unless it is used](https://stackoverflow.com/q/26545159/164234).

# Overview of cloud storage systems #

Each cloud storage system is slightly different.  Rclone attempts to
provide a unified interface to them, but some underlying differences
show through.

## Features ##

Here is an overview of the major features of each cloud storage system.

¹ Dropbox supports [its own custom
hash](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/content-hash).
This is an SHA256 sum of all the 4 MiB block SHA256s.

² SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and
`md5sum` or `sha1sum` as well as `echo` are in the remote's PATH.

³ WebDAV supports hashes when used with Fastmail Files, Owncloud and Nextcloud only.

⁴ WebDAV supports modtimes when used with Fastmail Files, Owncloud and Nextcloud only.

⁵ [QuickXorHash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/code-snippets/quickxorhash) is Microsoft's own hash.

⁶ Mail.ru uses its own modified SHA1 hash

⁷ pCloud only supports SHA1 (not MD5) in its EU region

⁸ Opendrive does not support creation of duplicate files using
their web client interface or other stock clients, but the underlying
storage platform has been determined to allow duplicate files, and it
is possible to create them with `rclone`.  It may be that this is a
mistake or an unsupported feature.

⁹ QingStor does not support SetModTime for objects bigger than 5 GiB.

¹⁰ FTP supports modtimes for the major FTP servers, and also others
if they advertised required protocol extensions. See [this](https://rclone.org/ftp/#modification-times)
for more details.

¹¹ Internet Archive requires option `wait_archive` to be set to a non-zero value
for full modtime support.

¹² HiDrive supports [its own custom
hash](https://static.hidrive.com/dev/0001).
It combines SHA1 sums for each 4 KiB block hierarchically to a single
top-level sum.

¹³ Uloz.to provides server-calculated MD5 hash upon file upload. MD5 and SHA256
hashes are client-calculated and stored as metadata fields.

### Hash ###

The cloud storage system supports various hash types of the objects.
The hashes are used when transferring data as an integrity check and
can be specifically used with the `--checksum` flag in syncs and in
the `check` command.

To use the verify checksums when transferring between cloud storage
systems they must support a common hash type.

### ModTime ###

Almost all cloud storage systems store some sort of timestamp
on objects, but several of them not something that is appropriate
to use for syncing. E.g. some backends will only write a timestamp
that represents the time of the upload. To be relevant for syncing
it should be able to store the modification time of the source
object. If this is not the case, rclone will only check the file
size by default, though can be configured to check the file hash
(with the `--checksum` flag). Ideally it should also be possible to
change the timestamp of an existing file without having to re-upload it.

| Key | Explanation |
|-----|-------------|
| `-` | ModTimes not supported - times likely the upload time |
| `R` | ModTimes supported on files but can't be changed without re-upload |
| `R/W` | Read and Write ModTimes fully supported on files |
| `DR` | ModTimes supported on files and directories but can't be changed without re-upload |
| `DR/W` | Read and Write ModTimes fully supported on files and directories |

Storage systems with a `-` in the ModTime column, means the
modification read on objects is not the modification time of the
file when uploaded. It is most likely the time the file was uploaded,
or possibly something else (like the time the picture was taken in
Google Photos).

Storage systems with a `R` (for read-only) in the ModTime column,
means the it keeps modification times on objects, and updates them
when uploading objects, but it does not support changing only the
modification time (`SetModTime` operation) without re-uploading,
possibly not even without deleting existing first. Some operations
in rclone, such as `copy` and `sync` commands, will automatically
check for `SetModTime` support and re-upload if necessary to keep
the modification times in sync. Other commands will not work
without `SetModTime` support, e.g. `touch` command on an existing
file will fail, and changes to modification time only on a files
in a `mount` will be silently ignored.

Storage systems with `R/W` (for read/write) in the ModTime column,
means they do also support modtime-only operations.

Storage systems with `D` in the ModTime column means that the
following symbols apply to directories as well as files.

### Case Insensitive ###

If a cloud storage systems is case sensitive then it is possible to
have two files which differ only in case, e.g. `file.txt` and
`FILE.txt`.  If a cloud storage system is case insensitive then that
isn't possible.

This can cause problems when syncing between a case insensitive
system and a case sensitive system.  The symptom of this is that no
matter how many times you run the sync it never completes fully.

The local filesystem and SFTP may or may not be case sensitive
depending on OS.

  * Windows - usually case insensitive, though case is preserved
  * OSX - usually case insensitive, though it is possible to format case sensitive
  * Linux - usually case sensitive, but there are case insensitive file systems (e.g. FAT formatted USB keys)

Most of the time this doesn't cause any problems as people tend to
avoid files whose name differs only by case even on case sensitive
systems.

### Duplicate files ###

If a cloud storage system allows duplicate files then it can have two
objects with the same name.

This confuses rclone greatly when syncing - use the `rclone dedupe`
command to rename or remove duplicates.

### Restricted filenames ###

Some cloud storage systems might have restrictions on the characters
that are usable in file or directory names.
When `rclone` detects such a name during a file upload, it will
transparently replace the restricted characters with similar looking
Unicode characters. To handle the different sets of restricted characters
for different backends, rclone uses something it calls [encoding](#encoding).

This process is designed to avoid ambiguous file names as much as
possible and allow to move files between many cloud storage systems
transparently.

The name shown by `rclone` to the user or during log output will only
contain a minimal set of [replaced characters](#restricted-characters)
to ensure correct formatting and not necessarily the actual name used
on the cloud storage.

This transformation is reversed when downloading a file or parsing
`rclone` arguments. For example, when uploading a file named `my file?.txt`
to Onedrive, it will be displayed as `my file?.txt` on the console, but
stored as `my file？.txt` to Onedrive (the `?` gets replaced by the similar
looking `？` character, the so-called "fullwidth question mark").
The reverse transformation allows to read a file `unusual/name.txt`
from Google Drive, by passing the name `unusual／name.txt` on the command line
(the `/` needs to be replaced by the similar looking `／` character).

#### Caveats {#restricted-filenames-caveats}

The filename encoding system works well in most cases, at least
where file names are written in English or similar languages.
You might not even notice it: It just works. In some cases it may
lead to issues, though. E.g. when file names are written in Chinese,
or Japanese, where it is always the Unicode fullwidth variants of the
punctuation marks that are used.

On Windows, the characters `:`, `*` and `?` are examples of restricted
characters. If these are used in filenames on a remote that supports it,
Rclone will transparently convert them to their fullwidth Unicode
variants `＊`, `？` and `：` when downloading to Windows, and back again
when uploading. This way files with names that are not allowed on Windows
can still be stored.

However, if you have files on your Windows system originally with these same
Unicode characters in their names, they will be included in the same conversion
process. E.g. if you create a file in your Windows filesystem with name
`Test：1.jpg`, where `：` is the Unicode fullwidth colon symbol, and use
rclone to upload it to Google Drive, which supports regular `:` (halfwidth
question mark), rclone will replace the fullwidth `:` with the
halfwidth `:` and store the file as `Test:1.jpg` in Google Drive. Since
both Windows and Google Drive allows the name `Test：1.jpg`, it would
probably be better if rclone just kept the name as is in this case.

With the opposite situation; if you have a file named `Test:1.jpg`,
in your Google Drive, e.g. uploaded from a Linux system where `:` is valid
in file names. Then later use rclone to copy this file to your Windows
computer you will notice that on your local disk it gets renamed
to `Test：1.jpg`. The original filename is not legal on Windows, due to
the `:`, and rclone therefore renames it to make the copy possible.
That is all good. However, this can also lead to an issue: If you already
had a *different* file named `Test：1.jpg` on Windows, and then use rclone
to copy either way. Rclone will then treat the file originally named
`Test:1.jpg` on Google Drive and the file originally named `Test：1.jpg`
on Windows as the same file, and replace the contents from one with the other.

Its virtually impossible to handle all cases like these correctly in all
situations, but by customizing the [encoding option](#encoding), changing the
set of characters that rclone should convert, you should be able to
create a configuration that works well for your specific situation.
See also the [example](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding-example-windows) below.

(Windows was used as an example of a file system with many restricted
characters, and Google drive a storage system with few.)

#### Default restricted characters {#restricted-characters}

The table below shows the characters that are replaced by default.

When a replacement character is found in a filename, this character
will be escaped with the `‛` character to avoid ambiguous file names.
(e.g. a file named `␀.txt` would shown as `‛␀.txt`)

Each cloud storage backend can use a different set of characters,
which will be specified in the documentation for each backend.

The default encoding will also encode these file names as they are
problematic with many cloud storage systems.

| ..        | ．．         |

#### Invalid UTF-8 bytes {#invalid-utf8}

Some backends only support a sequence of well formed UTF-8 bytes
as file or directory names.

In this case all invalid UTF-8 bytes will be replaced with a quoted
representation of the byte value to allow uploading a file to such a
backend. For example, the invalid byte `0xFE` will be encoded as `‛FE`.

A common source of invalid UTF-8 bytes are local filesystems, that store
names in a different encoding than UTF-8 or UTF-16, like latin1. See the
[local filenames](https://rclone.org/local/#filenames) section for details.

#### Encoding option {#encoding}

Most backends have an encoding option, specified as a flag
`--backend-encoding` where `backend` is the name of the backend, or as
a config parameter `encoding` (you'll need to select the Advanced
config in `rclone config` to see it).

This will have default value which encodes and decodes characters in
such a way as to preserve the maximum number of characters (see
above).

However this can be incorrect in some scenarios, for example if you
have a Windows file system with Unicode fullwidth characters
`＊`, `？` or `：`, that you want to remain as those characters on the
remote rather than being translated to regular (halfwidth) `*`, `?` and `:`.

The `--backend-encoding` flags allow you to change that. You can
disable the encoding completely with `--backend-encoding Raw` or set
`encoding = Raw` in the config file.

Encoding takes a comma separated list of encodings. You can see the
list of all possible values by passing an invalid value to this
flag, e.g. `--local-encoding "help"`. The command `rclone help flags encoding`
will show you the defaults for the backends.

| Encoding  | Characters | Encoded as |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Asterisk | `*` | `＊` |
| BackQuote | `` ` `` | `｀` |
| BackSlash | `\` | `＼` |
| Colon | `:` | `：` |
| CrLf | CR 0x0D, LF 0x0A | `␍`, `␊` |
| Ctl | All control characters 0x00-0x1F | `␀␁␂␃␄␅␆␇␈␉␊␋␌␍␎␏␐␑␒␓␔␕␖␗␘␙␚␛␜␝␞␟` |
| Del | DEL 0x7F | `␡` |
| Dollar | `$` | `＄` |
| Dot | `.` or `..` as entire string | `．`, `．．` |
| DoubleQuote | `"` | `＂` |
| Exclamation | `!` | `！` |
| Hash | `#` | `＃` |
| InvalidUtf8 | An invalid UTF-8 character (e.g. latin1) | `�` |
| LeftCrLfHtVt | CR 0x0D, LF 0x0A, HT 0x09, VT 0x0B on the left of a string | `␍`, `␊`, `␉`, `␋` |
| LeftPeriod | `.` on the left of a string | `.` |
| LeftSpace | SPACE on the left of a string | `␠` |
| LeftTilde | `~` on the left of a string | `～` |
| LtGt | `<`, `>` | `＜`, `＞` |
| None ¹ | NUL 0x00 | ␀ |
| Percent | `%` | `％` |
| Pipe | \| | `｜` |
| Question | `?` | `？` |
| RightCrLfHtVt | CR 0x0D, LF 0x0A, HT 0x09, VT 0x0B on the right of a string | `␍`, `␊`, `␉`, `␋` |
| RightPeriod | `.` on the right of a string | `.` |
| RightSpace | SPACE on the right of a string | `␠` |
| Semicolon | `;` | `；` |
| SingleQuote | `'` | `＇` |
| Slash | `/` | `／` |
| SquareBracket | `[`, `]` | `［`, `］` |

¹ Encoding from NUL 0x00 to ␀ is always implicit except when using Raw.
It was previously incorrectly documented as disabling encoding,
and to maintain backward compatibility, its behavior has not been changed.

##### Encoding example: FTP

To take a specific example, the FTP backend's default encoding is

    --ftp-encoding "Slash,Del,Ctl,RightSpace,Dot"

However, let's say the FTP server is running on Windows and can't have
any of the invalid Windows characters in file names. You are backing
up Linux servers to this FTP server which do have those characters in
file names. So you would add the Windows set which are

    Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot

to the existing ones, giving:

    Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot,Del,RightSpace

This can be specified using the `--ftp-encoding` flag or using an `encoding` parameter in the config file.

##### Encoding example: Windows

As a nother example, take a Windows system where there is a file with
name `Test：1.jpg`, where `：` is the Unicode fullwidth colon symbol.
When using rclone to copy this to a remote which supports `:`,
the regular (halfwidth) colon (such as Google Drive), you will notice
that the file gets renamed to `Test:1.jpg`.

To avoid this you can change the set of characters rclone should convert
for the local filesystem, using command-line argument `--local-encoding`.
Rclone's default behavior on Windows corresponds to

```
--local-encoding "Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot"
```

If you want to use fullwidth characters `：`, `＊` and `？` in your filenames
without rclone changing them when uploading to a remote, then set the same as
the default value but without `Colon,Question,Asterisk`:

```
--local-encoding "Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot"
```

Alternatively, you can disable the conversion of any characters with `--local-encoding Raw`.

Instead of using command-line argument `--local-encoding`, you may also set it
as [environment variable](https://rclone.org/docs/#environment-variables) `RCLONE_LOCAL_ENCODING`,
or [configure](https://rclone.org/docs/#configure) a remote of type `local` in your config,
and set the `encoding` option there.

The risk by doing this is that if you have a filename with the regular (halfwidth)
`:`, `*` and `?` in your cloud storage, and you try to download
it to your Windows filesystem, this will fail. These characters are not
valid in filenames on Windows, and you have told rclone not to work around
this by converting them to valid fullwidth variants.

### MIME Type ###

MIME types (also known as media types) classify types of documents
using a simple text classification, e.g. `text/html` or
`application/pdf`.

Some cloud storage systems support reading (`R`) the MIME type of
objects and some support writing (`W`) the MIME type of objects.

The MIME type can be important if you are serving files directly to
HTTP from the storage system.

If you are copying from a remote which supports reading (`R`) to a
remote which supports writing (`W`) then rclone will preserve the MIME
types.  Otherwise they will be guessed from the extension, or the
remote itself may assign the MIME type.

### Metadata

Backends may or may support reading or writing metadata. They may
support reading and writing system metadata (metadata intrinsic to
that backend) and/or user metadata (general purpose metadata).

The levels of metadata support are

| Key | Explanation |
|-----|-------------|
| `R` | Read only System Metadata on files only|
| `RW` | Read and write System Metadata on files only|
| `RWU` | Read and write System Metadata and read and write User Metadata on files only|
| `DR` | Read only System Metadata on files and directories |
| `DRW` | Read and write System Metadata on files and directories|
| `DRWU` | Read and write System Metadata and read and write User Metadata on files and directories |

See [the metadata docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata) for more info.

## Optional Features ##

All rclone remotes support a base command set. Other features depend
upon backend-specific capabilities.

¹ Note Swift implements this in order to delete directory markers but
it doesn't actually have a quicker way of deleting files other than
deleting them individually.

² Storj implements this efficiently only for entire buckets. If
purging a directory inside a bucket, files are deleted individually.

³ StreamUpload is not supported with Nextcloud

⁴ Use the `--sftp-copy-is-hardlink` flag to enable.

⁵ Use the `--onedrive-delta` flag to enable.

### Purge ###

This deletes a directory quicker than just deleting all the files in
the directory.

### Copy ###

Used when copying an object to and from the same remote.  This known
as a server-side copy so you can copy a file without downloading it
and uploading it again.  It is used if you use `rclone copy` or
`rclone move` if the remote doesn't support `Move` directly.

If the server doesn't support `Copy` directly then for copy operations
the file is downloaded then re-uploaded.

### Move ###

Used when moving/renaming an object on the same remote.  This is known
as a server-side move of a file.  This is used in `rclone move` if the
server doesn't support `DirMove`.

If the server isn't capable of `Move` then rclone simulates it with
`Copy` then delete.  If the server doesn't support `Copy` then rclone
will download the file and re-upload it.

### DirMove ###

This is used to implement `rclone move` to move a directory if
possible.  If it isn't then it will use `Move` on each file (which
falls back to `Copy` then download and upload - see `Move` section).

### CleanUp ###

This is used for emptying the trash for a remote by `rclone cleanup`.

If the server can't do `CleanUp` then `rclone cleanup` will return an
error.

‡‡ Note that while Box implements this it has to delete every file
individually so it will be slower than emptying the trash via the WebUI

### ListR ###

The remote supports a recursive list to list all the contents beneath
a directory quickly.  This enables the `--fast-list` flag to work.
See the [rclone docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

### StreamUpload ###

Some remotes allow files to be uploaded without knowing the file size
in advance. This allows certain operations to work without spooling the
file to local disk first, e.g. `rclone rcat`.

### MultithreadUpload ###

Some remotes allow transfers to the remote to be sent as chunks in
parallel. If this is supported then rclone will use multi-thread
copying to transfer files much faster.

### LinkSharing ###

Sets the necessary permissions on a file or folder and prints a link
that allows others to access them, even if they don't have an account
on the particular cloud provider.

### About ###

Rclone `about` prints quota information for a remote. Typical output
includes bytes used, free, quota and in trash.

If a remote lacks about capability `rclone about remote:`returns
an error.

Backends without about capability cannot determine free space for an
rclone mount, or use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an
rclone union remote.

See [rclone about command](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

### EmptyDir ###

The remote supports empty directories. See [Limitations](https://rclone.org/bugs/#limitations)
 for details. Most Object/Bucket-based remotes do not support this.

# Docker Volume Plugin

## Introduction

Docker 1.9 has added support for creating
[named volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) via
[command-line interface](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/)
and mounting them in containers as a way to share data between them.
Since Docker 1.10 you can create named volumes with
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) by descriptions in
[docker-compose.yml](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#volume-configuration-reference)
files for use by container groups on a single host.
As of Docker 1.12 volumes are supported by
[Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/key-concepts/)
included with Docker Engine and created from descriptions in
[swarm compose v3](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volume-configuration-reference)
files for use with _swarm stacks_ across multiple cluster nodes.

[Docker Volume Plugins](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_volume/)
augment the default `local` volume driver included in Docker with stateful
volumes shared across containers and hosts. Unlike local volumes, your
data will _not_ be deleted when such volume is removed. Plugins can run
managed by the docker daemon, as a native system service
(under systemd, _sysv_ or _upstart_) or as a standalone executable.
Rclone can run as docker volume plugin in all these modes.
It interacts with the local docker daemon
via [plugin API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugin_api/) and
handles mounting of remote file systems into docker containers so it must
run on the same host as the docker daemon or on every Swarm node.

## Getting started

In the first example we will use the [SFTP](https://rclone.org/sftp/)
rclone volume with Docker engine on a standalone Ubuntu machine.

Start from [installing Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
on the host.

The _FUSE_ driver is a prerequisite for rclone mounting and should be
installed on host:
```
sudo apt-get -y install fuse
```

Create two directories required by rclone docker plugin:
```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache
```

Install the managed rclone docker plugin for your architecture (here `amd64`):
```
docker plugin install rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64 args="-v" --alias rclone --grant-all-permissions
docker plugin list
```

Create your [SFTP volume](https://rclone.org/sftp/#standard-options):
```
docker volume create firstvolume -d rclone -o type=sftp -o sftp-host=_hostname_ -o sftp-user=_username_ -o sftp-pass=_password_ -o allow-other=true
```

Note that since all options are static, you don't even have to run
`rclone config` or create the `rclone.conf` file (but the `config` directory
should still be present). In the simplest case you can use `localhost`
as _hostname_ and your SSH credentials as _username_ and _password_.
You can also change the remote path to your home directory on the host,
for example `-o path=/home/username`.


Time to create a test container and mount the volume into it:
```
docker run --rm -it -v firstvolume:/mnt --workdir /mnt ubuntu:latest bash
```

If all goes well, you will enter the new container and change right to
the mounted SFTP remote. You can type `ls` to list the mounted directory
or otherwise play with it. Type `exit` when you are done.
The container will stop but the volume will stay, ready to be reused.
When it's not needed anymore, remove it:
```
docker volume list
docker volume remove firstvolume
```

Now let us try **something more elaborate**:
[Google Drive](https://rclone.org/drive/) volume on multi-node Docker Swarm.

You should start from installing Docker and FUSE, creating plugin
directories and installing rclone plugin on _every_ swarm node.
Then [setup the Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-mode/).

Google Drive volumes need an access token which can be setup via web
browser and will be periodically renewed by rclone. The managed
plugin cannot run a browser so we will use a technique similar to the
[rclone setup on a headless box](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/).

Run [rclone config](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_create/)
on _another_ machine equipped with _web browser_ and graphical user interface.
Create the [Google Drive remote](https://rclone.org/drive/#standard-options).
When done, transfer the resulting `rclone.conf` to the Swarm cluster
and save as `/var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config/rclone.conf`
on _every_ node. By default this location is accessible only to the
root user so you will need appropriate privileges. The resulting config
will look like this:
```
[gdrive]
type = drive
scope = drive
drive_id = 1234567...
root_folder_id = 0Abcd...
token = {"access_token":...}
```

Now create the file named `example.yml` with a swarm stack description
like this:
```
version: '3'
services:
  heimdall:
    image: linuxserver/heimdall:latest
    ports: [8080:80]
    volumes: [configdata:/config]
volumes:
  configdata:
    driver: rclone
    driver_opts:
      remote: 'gdrive:heimdall'
      allow_other: 'true'
      vfs_cache_mode: full
      poll_interval: 0
```

and run the stack:
```
docker stack deploy example -c ./example.yml
```

After a few seconds docker will spread the parsed stack description
over cluster, create the `example_heimdall` service on port _8080_,
run service containers on one or more cluster nodes and request
the `example_configdata` volume from rclone plugins on the node hosts.
You can use the following commands to confirm results:
```
docker service ls
docker service ps example_heimdall
docker volume ls
```

Point your browser to `http://cluster.host.address:8080` and play with
the service. Stop it with `docker stack remove example` when you are done.
Note that the `example_configdata` volume(s) created on demand at the
cluster nodes will not be automatically removed together with the stack
but stay for future reuse. You can remove them manually by invoking
the `docker volume remove example_configdata` command on every node.

## Creating Volumes via CLI

Volumes can be created with [docker volume create](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/).
Here are a few examples:
```
docker volume create vol1 -d rclone -o remote=storj: -o vfs-cache-mode=full
docker volume create vol2 -d rclone -o remote=:storj,access_grant=xxx:heimdall
docker volume create vol3 -d rclone -o type=storj -o path=heimdall -o storj-access-grant=xxx -o poll-interval=0
```

Note the `-d rclone` flag that tells docker to request volume from the
rclone driver. This works even if you installed managed driver by its full
name `rclone/docker-volume-rclone` because you provided the `--alias rclone`
option.

Volumes can be inspected as follows:
```
docker volume list
docker volume inspect vol1
```

## Volume Configuration

Rclone flags and volume options are set via the `-o` flag to the
`docker volume create` command. They include backend-specific parameters
as well as mount and _VFS_ options. Also there are a few
special `-o` options:
`remote`, `fs`, `type`, `path`, `mount-type` and `persist`.

`remote` determines an existing remote name from the config file, with
trailing colon and optionally with a remote path. See the full syntax in
the [rclone documentation](https://rclone.org/docs/#syntax-of-remote-paths).
This option can be aliased as `fs` to prevent confusion with the
_remote_ parameter of such backends as _crypt_ or _alias_.

The `remote=:backend:dir/subdir` syntax can be used to create
[on-the-fly (config-less) remotes](https://rclone.org/docs/#backend-path-to-dir),
while the `type` and `path` options provide a simpler alternative for this.
Using two split options
```
-o type=backend -o path=dir/subdir
```
is equivalent to the combined syntax
```
-o remote=:backend:dir/subdir
```
but is arguably easier to parameterize in scripts.
The `path` part is optional.

[Mount and VFS options](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_docker/#options)
as well as [backend parameters](https://rclone.org/flags/#backend-flags) are named
like their twin command-line flags without the `--` CLI prefix.
Optionally you can use underscores instead of dashes in option names.
For example, `--vfs-cache-mode full` becomes
`-o vfs-cache-mode=full` or `-o vfs_cache_mode=full`.
Boolean CLI flags without value will gain the `true` value, e.g.
`--allow-other` becomes `-o allow-other=true` or `-o allow_other=true`.

Please note that you can provide parameters only for the backend immediately
referenced by the backend type of mounted `remote`.
If this is a wrapping backend like _alias, chunker or crypt_, you cannot
provide options for the referred to remote or backend. This limitation is
imposed by the rclone connection string parser. The only workaround is to
feed plugin with `rclone.conf` or configure plugin arguments (see below).

## Special Volume Options

`mount-type` determines the mount method and in general can be one of:
`mount`, `cmount`, or `mount2`. This can be aliased as `mount_type`.
It should be noted that the managed rclone docker plugin currently does
not support the `cmount` method and `mount2` is rarely needed.
This option defaults to the first found method, which is usually `mount`
so you generally won't need it.

`persist` is a reserved boolean (true/false) option.
In future it will allow to persist on-the-fly remotes in the plugin
`rclone.conf` file.

## Connection Strings

The `remote` value can be extended
with [connection strings](https://rclone.org/docs/#connection-strings)
as an alternative way to supply backend parameters. This is equivalent
to the `-o` backend options with one _syntactic difference_.
Inside connection string the backend prefix must be dropped from parameter
names but in the `-o param=value` array it must be present.
For instance, compare the following option array
```
-o remote=:sftp:/home -o sftp-host=localhost
```
with equivalent connection string:
```
-o remote=:sftp,host=localhost:/home
```
This difference exists because flag options `-o key=val` include not only
backend parameters but also mount/VFS flags and possibly other settings.
Also it allows to discriminate the `remote` option from the `crypt-remote`
(or similarly named backend parameters) and arguably simplifies scripting
due to clearer value substitution.

## Using with Swarm or Compose

Both _Docker Swarm_ and _Docker Compose_ use
[YAML](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html)-formatted text files to describe
groups (stacks) of containers, their properties, networks and volumes.
_Compose_ uses the [compose v2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#volume-configuration-reference) format,
_Swarm_ uses the [compose v3](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volume-configuration-reference) format.
They are mostly similar, differences are explained in the
[docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#upgrading).

Volumes are described by the children of the top-level `volumes:` node.
Each of them should be named after its volume and have at least two
elements, the self-explanatory `driver: rclone` value and the
`driver_opts:` structure playing the same role as `-o key=val` CLI flags:

```
volumes:
  volume_name_1:
    driver: rclone
    driver_opts:
      remote: 'gdrive:'
      allow_other: 'true'
      vfs_cache_mode: full
      token: '{"type": "borrower", "expires": "2021-12-31"}'
      poll_interval: 0
```

Notice a few important details:
- YAML prefers `_` in option names instead of `-`.
- YAML treats single and double quotes interchangeably.
  Simple strings and integers can be left unquoted.
- Boolean values must be quoted like `'true'` or `"false"` because
  these two words are reserved by YAML.
- The filesystem string is keyed with `remote` (or with `fs`).
  Normally you can omit quotes here, but if the string ends with colon,
  you **must** quote it like `remote: "storage_box:"`.
- YAML is picky about surrounding braces in values as this is in fact
  another [syntax for key/value mappings](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2790832).
  For example, JSON access tokens usually contain double quotes and
  surrounding braces, so you must put them in single quotes.

## Installing as Managed Plugin

Docker daemon can install plugins from an image registry and run them managed.
We maintain the
[docker-volume-rclone](https://hub.docker.com/p/rclone/docker-volume-rclone/)
plugin image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

Rclone volume plugin requires **Docker Engine >= 19.03.15**

The plugin requires presence of two directories on the host before it can
be installed. Note that plugin will **not** create them automatically.
By default they must exist on host at the following locations
(though you can tweak the paths):
- `/var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config`
  is reserved for the `rclone.conf` config file and **must** exist
  even if it's empty and the config file is not present.
- `/var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache`
  holds the plugin state file as well as optional VFS caches.

You can [install managed plugin](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/plugin_install/)
with default settings as follows:
```
docker plugin install rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64 --grant-all-permissions --alias rclone
```

The `:amd64` part of the image specification after colon is called a _tag_.
Usually you will want to install the latest plugin for your architecture. In
this case the tag will just name it, like `amd64` above. The following plugin
architectures are currently available:
- `amd64`
- `arm64`
- `arm-v7`

Sometimes you might want a concrete plugin version, not the latest one.
Then you should use image tag in the form `:ARCHITECTURE-VERSION`.
For example, to install plugin version `v1.56.2` on architecture `arm64`
you will use tag `arm64-1.56.2` (note the removed `v`) so the full image
specification becomes `rclone/docker-volume-rclone:arm64-1.56.2`.

We also provide the `latest` plugin tag, but since docker does not support
multi-architecture plugins as of the time of this writing, this tag is
currently an **alias for `amd64`**.
By convention the `latest` tag is the default one and can be omitted, thus
both `rclone/docker-volume-rclone:latest` and just `rclone/docker-volume-rclone`
will refer to the latest plugin release for the `amd64` platform.

Also the `amd64` part can be omitted from the versioned rclone plugin tags.
For example, rclone image reference `rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64-1.56.2`
can be abbreviated as `rclone/docker-volume-rclone:1.56.2` for convenience.
However, for non-intel architectures you still have to use the full tag as
`amd64` or `latest` will fail to start.

Managed plugin is in fact a special container running in a namespace separate
from normal docker containers. Inside it runs the `rclone serve docker`
command. The config and cache directories are bind-mounted into the
container at start. The docker daemon connects to a unix socket created
by the command inside the container. The command creates on-demand remote
mounts right inside, then docker machinery propagates them through kernel
mount namespaces and bind-mounts into requesting user containers.

You can tweak a few plugin settings after installation when it's disabled
(not in use), for instance:
```
docker plugin disable rclone
docker plugin set rclone RCLONE_VERBOSE=2 config=/etc/rclone args="--vfs-cache-mode=writes --allow-other"
docker plugin enable rclone
docker plugin inspect rclone
```

Note that if docker refuses to disable the plugin, you should find and
remove all active volumes connected with it as well as containers and
swarm services that use them. This is rather tedious so please carefully
plan in advance.

You can tweak the following settings:
`args`, `config`, `cache`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`
and `RCLONE_VERBOSE`.
It's _your_ task to keep plugin settings in sync across swarm cluster nodes.

`args` sets command-line arguments for the `rclone serve docker` command
(_none_ by default). Arguments should be separated by space so you will
normally want to put them in quotes on the
[docker plugin set](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/plugin_set/)
command line. Both [serve docker flags](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_docker/#options)
and [generic rclone flags](https://rclone.org/flags/) are supported, including backend
parameters that will be used as defaults for volume creation.
Note that plugin will fail (due to [this docker bug](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/v20.10.7/plugin/v2/plugin.go#L195))
if the `args` value is empty. Use e.g. `args="-v"` as a workaround.

`config=/host/dir` sets alternative host location for the config directory.
Plugin will look for `rclone.conf` here. It's not an error if the config
file is not present but the directory must exist. Please note that plugin
can periodically rewrite the config file, for example when it renews
storage access tokens. Keep this in mind and try to avoid races between
the plugin and other instances of rclone on the host that might try to
change the config simultaneously resulting in corrupted `rclone.conf`.
You can also put stuff like private key files for SFTP remotes in this
directory. Just note that it's bind-mounted inside the plugin container
at the predefined path `/data/config`. For example, if your key file is
named `sftp-box1.key` on the host, the corresponding volume config option
should read `-o sftp-key-file=/data/config/sftp-box1.key`.

`cache=/host/dir` sets alternative host location for the _cache_ directory.
The plugin will keep VFS caches here. Also it will create and maintain
the `docker-plugin.state` file in this directory. When the plugin is
restarted or reinstalled, it will look in this file to recreate any volumes
that existed previously. However, they will not be re-mounted into
consuming containers after restart. Usually this is not a problem as
the docker daemon normally will restart affected user containers after
failures, daemon restarts or host reboots.

`RCLONE_VERBOSE` sets plugin verbosity from `0` (errors only, by default)
to `2` (debugging). Verbosity can be also tweaked via `args="-v [-v] ..."`.
Since arguments are more generic, you will rarely need this setting.
The plugin output by default feeds the docker daemon log on local host.
Log entries are reflected as _errors_ in the docker log but retain their
actual level assigned by rclone in the encapsulated message string.

`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY` customize the plugin proxy settings.

You can set custom plugin options right when you install it, _in one go_:
```
docker plugin remove rclone
docker plugin install rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64 \
       --alias rclone --grant-all-permissions \
       args="-v --allow-other" config=/etc/rclone
docker plugin inspect rclone
```

## Healthchecks

The docker plugin volume protocol doesn't provide a way for plugins
to inform the docker daemon that a volume is (un-)available.
As a workaround you can setup a healthcheck to verify that the mount
is responding, for example:
```
services:
  my_service:
    image: my_image
    healthcheck:
      test: ls /path/to/rclone/mount || exit 1
      interval: 1m
      timeout: 15s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 15s
```

## Running Plugin under Systemd

In most cases you should prefer managed mode. Moreover, MacOS and Windows
do not support native Docker plugins. Please use managed mode on these
systems. Proceed further only if you are on Linux.

First, [install rclone](https://rclone.org/install/).
You can just run it (type `rclone serve docker` and hit enter) for the test.

Install _FUSE_:
```
sudo apt-get -y install fuse
```

Download two systemd configuration files:
[docker-volume-rclone.service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rclone/rclone/master/contrib/docker-plugin/systemd/docker-volume-rclone.service)
and [docker-volume-rclone.socket](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rclone/rclone/master/contrib/docker-plugin/systemd/docker-volume-rclone.socket).

Put them to the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory:
```
cp docker-volume-plugin.service /etc/systemd/system/
cp docker-volume-plugin.socket  /etc/systemd/system/
```

Please note that all commands in this section must be run as _root_ but
we omit `sudo` prefix for brevity.
Now create directories required by the service:
```
mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-volumes/rclone
mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config
mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache
```

Run the docker plugin service in the socket activated mode:
```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start docker-volume-rclone.service
systemctl enable docker-volume-rclone.socket
systemctl start docker-volume-rclone.socket
systemctl restart docker
```

Or run the service directly:
- run `systemctl daemon-reload` to let systemd pick up new config
- run `systemctl enable docker-volume-rclone.service` to make the new
  service start automatically when you power on your machine.
- run `systemctl start docker-volume-rclone.service`
  to start the service now.
- run `systemctl restart docker` to restart docker daemon and let it
  detect the new plugin socket. Note that this step is not needed in
  managed mode where docker knows about plugin state changes.

The two methods are equivalent from the user perspective, but I personally
prefer socket activation.

## Troubleshooting

You can [see managed plugin settings](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/#debugging-plugins)
with
```
docker plugin list
docker plugin inspect rclone
```
Note that docker (including latest 20.10.7) will not show actual values
of `args`, just the defaults.

Use `journalctl --unit docker` to see managed plugin output as part of
the docker daemon log. Note that docker reflects plugin lines as _errors_
but their actual level can be seen from encapsulated message string.

You will usually install the latest version of managed plugin for your platform.
Use the following commands to print the actual installed version:
```
PLUGID=$(docker plugin list --no-trunc | awk '/rclone/{print$1}')
sudo runc --root /run/docker/runtime-runc/plugins.moby exec $PLUGID rclone version
```

You can even use `runc` to run shell inside the plugin container:
```
sudo runc --root /run/docker/runtime-runc/plugins.moby exec --tty $PLUGID bash
```

Also you can use curl to check the plugin socket connectivity:
```
docker plugin list --no-trunc
PLUGID=123abc...
sudo curl -H Content-Type:application/json -XPOST -d {} --unix-socket /run/docker/plugins/$PLUGID/rclone.sock http://localhost/Plugin.Activate
```
though this is rarely needed.

## Caveats

Finally I'd like to mention a _caveat with updating volume settings_.
Docker CLI does not have a dedicated command like `docker volume update`.
It may be tempting to invoke `docker volume create` with updated options
on existing volume, but there is a gotcha. The command will do nothing,
it won't even return an error. I hope that docker maintainers will fix
this some day. In the meantime be aware that you must remove your volume
before recreating it with new settings:
```
docker volume remove my_vol
docker volume create my_vol -d rclone -o opt1=new_val1 ...
```

and verify that settings did update:
```
docker volume list
docker volume inspect my_vol
```

If docker refuses to remove the volume, you should find containers
or swarm services that use it and stop them first.

## Bisync
`bisync` is **in beta** and is considered an **advanced command**, so use with care.
Make sure you have read and understood the entire [manual](https://rclone.org/bisync) (especially the [Limitations](#limitations) section) before using, or data loss can result. Questions can be asked in the [Rclone Forum](https://forum.rclone.org/).

## Getting started {#getting-started}

- [Install rclone](https://rclone.org/install/) and setup your remotes.
- Bisync will create its working directory
  at `~/.cache/rclone/bisync` on Linux, `/Users/yourusername/Library/Caches/rclone/bisync` on Mac,
  or `C:\Users\MyLogin\AppData\Local\rclone\bisync` on Windows.
  Make sure that this location is writable.
- Run bisync with the `--resync` flag, specifying the paths
  to the local and remote sync directory roots.
- For successive sync runs, leave off the `--resync` flag. (**Important!**)
- Consider using a [filters file](#filtering) for excluding
  unnecessary files and directories from the sync.
- Consider setting up the [--check-access](#check-access) feature
  for safety.
- On Linux or Mac, consider setting up a [crontab entry](#cron). bisync can
  safely run in concurrent cron jobs thanks to lock files it maintains.

For example, your first command might look like this:

```
rclone bisync remote1:path1 remote2:path2 --create-empty-src-dirs --compare size,modtime,checksum --slow-hash-sync-only --resilient -MvP --drive-skip-gdocs --fix-case --resync --dry-run
```
If all looks good, run it again without `--dry-run`. After that, remove `--resync` as well.

Here is a typical run log (with timestamps removed for clarity):

```
rclone bisync /testdir/path1/ /testdir/path2/ --verbose
INFO  : Synching Path1 "/testdir/path1/" with Path2 "/testdir/path2/"

```

Arbitrary rclone flags may be specified on the
[bisync command line](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_bisync/), for example
`rclone bisync ./testdir/path1/ gdrive:testdir/path2/ --drive-skip-gdocs -v -v --timeout 10s`
Note that interactions of various rclone flags with bisync process flow
has not been fully tested yet.

### Paths

Path1 and Path2 arguments may be references to any mix of local directory
paths (absolute or relative), UNC paths (`//server/share/path`),
Windows drive paths (with a drive letter and `:`) or configured
[remotes](https://rclone.org/docs/#syntax-of-remote-paths) with optional subdirectory paths.
Cloud references are distinguished by having a `:` in the argument
(see [Windows support](#windows) below).

Path1 and Path2 are treated equally, in that neither has priority for
file changes (except during [`--resync`](#resync)), and access efficiency does not change whether a remote
is on Path1 or Path2.

The listings in bisync working directory (default: `~/.cache/rclone/bisync`)
are named based on the Path1 and Path2 arguments so that separate syncs
to individual directories within the tree may be set up, e.g.:
`path_to_local_tree..dropbox_subdir.lst`.

Any empty directories after the sync on both the Path1 and Path2
filesystems are not deleted by default, unless `--create-empty-src-dirs` is specified. 
If the `--remove-empty-dirs` flag is specified, then both paths will have ALL empty directories purged
as the last step in the process.

## Command-line flags

### --resync

This will effectively make both Path1 and Path2 filesystems contain a
matching superset of all files. By default, Path2 files that do not exist in Path1 will
be copied to Path1, and the process will then copy the Path1 tree to Path2.

The `--resync` sequence is roughly equivalent to the following (but see [`--resync-mode`](#resync-mode) for other options):
```
rclone copy Path2 Path1 --ignore-existing [--create-empty-src-dirs]
rclone copy Path1 Path2 [--create-empty-src-dirs]
```

The base directories on both Path1 and Path2 filesystems must exist
or bisync will fail. This is required for safety - that bisync can verify
that both paths are valid.

When using `--resync`, a newer version of a file on the Path2 filesystem
will (by default) be overwritten by the Path1 filesystem version.
(Note that this is [NOT entirely symmetrical](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5681#issuecomment-938761815), and more symmetrical options can be specified with the [`--resync-mode`](#resync-mode) flag.)
Carefully evaluate deltas using [--dry-run](https://rclone.org/flags/#non-backend-flags).

For a resync run, one of the paths may be empty (no files in the path tree).
The resync run should result in files on both paths, else a normal non-resync
run will fail.

For a non-resync run, either path being empty (no files in the tree) fails with
`Empty current PathN listing. Cannot sync to an empty directory: X.pathN.lst`
This is a safety check that an unexpected empty path does not result in
deleting **everything** in the other path.

Note that `--resync` implies `--resync-mode path1` unless a different
[`--resync-mode`](#resync-mode)  is explicitly specified.
It is not necessary to use both the `--resync` and `--resync-mode` flags --
either one is sufficient without the other.

**Note:** `--resync` (including `--resync-mode`) should only be used under three specific (rare) circumstances:
1. It is your _first_ bisync run (between these two paths)
2. You've just made changes to your bisync settings (such as editing the contents of your `--filters-file`)
3. There was an error on the prior run, and as a result, bisync now requires `--resync` to recover

The rest of the time, you should _omit_ `--resync`. The reason is because `--resync` will only _copy_ (not _sync_) each side to the other.
Therefore, if you included `--resync` for every bisync run, it would never be possible to delete a file --
the deleted file would always keep reappearing at the end of every run (because it's being copied from the other side where it still exists).
Similarly, renaming a file would always result in a duplicate copy (both old and new name) on both sides.

If you find that frequent interruptions from #3 are an issue, rather than
automatically running `--resync`, the recommended alternative is to use the
[`--resilient`](#resilient), [`--recover`](#recover), and
[`--conflict-resolve`](#conflict-resolve) flags, (along with [Graceful
Shutdown](#graceful-shutdown) mode, when needed) for a very robust
"set-it-and-forget-it" bisync setup that can automatically bounce back from
almost any interruption it might encounter. Consider adding something like the
following:

```
--resilient --recover --max-lock 2m --conflict-resolve newer
```

### --resync-mode CHOICE {#resync-mode}

In the event that a file differs on both sides during a `--resync`,
`--resync-mode` controls which version will overwrite the other. The supported
options are similar to [`--conflict-resolve`](#conflict-resolve). For all of
the following options, the version that is kept is referred to as the "winner",
and the version that is overwritten (deleted) is referred to as the "loser".
The options are named after the "winner":

- `path1` - (the default) - the version from Path1 is unconditionally
considered the winner (regardless of `modtime` and `size`, if any). This can be
useful if one side is more trusted or up-to-date than the other, at the time of
the `--resync`.
- `path2` - same as `path1`, except the path2 version is considered the winner.
- `newer` - the newer file (by `modtime`) is considered the winner, regardless
of which side it came from. This may result in having a mix of some winners
from Path1, and some winners from Path2. (The implementation is analogous to
running `rclone copy --update` in both directions.)
- `older` - same as `newer`, except the older file is considered the winner,
and the newer file is considered the loser.
- `larger` - the larger file (by `size`) is considered the winner (regardless
of `modtime`, if any). This can be a useful option for remotes without
`modtime` support, or with the kinds of files (such as logs) that tend to grow
but not shrink, over time.
- `smaller` - the smaller file (by `size`) is considered the winner (regardless
of `modtime`, if any).

For all of the above options, note the following:
- If either of the underlying remotes lacks support for the chosen method, it
will be ignored and will fall back to the default of `path1`. (For example, if
`--resync-mode newer` is set, but one of the paths uses a remote that doesn't
support `modtime`.)
- If a winner can't be determined because the chosen method's attribute is
missing or equal, it will be ignored, and bisync will instead try to determine
whether the files differ by looking at the other `--compare` methods in effect.
(For example, if `--resync-mode newer` is set, but the Path1 and Path2 modtimes
are identical, bisync will compare the sizes.) If bisync concludes that they
differ, preference is given to whichever is the "source" at that moment. (In
practice, this gives a slight advantage to Path2, as the 2to1 copy comes before
the 1to2 copy.) If the files _do not_ differ, nothing is copied (as both sides
are already correct).
- These options apply only to files that exist on both sides (with the same
name and relative path). Files that exist *only* on one side and not the other
are *always* copied to the other, during `--resync` (this is one of the main
differences between resync and non-resync runs.).
- `--conflict-resolve`, `--conflict-loser`, and `--conflict-suffix` do not
apply during `--resync`, and unlike these flags, nothing is renamed during
`--resync`. When a file differs on both sides during `--resync`, one version
always overwrites the other (much like in `rclone copy`.) (Consider using
[`--backup-dir`](#backup-dir1-and-backup-dir2) to retain a backup of the losing
version.)
- Unlike for `--conflict-resolve`, `--resync-mode none` is not a valid option
(or rather, it will be interpreted as "no resync", unless `--resync` has also
been specified, in which case it will be ignored.)
- Winners and losers are decided at the individual file-level only (there is
not currently an option to pick an entire winning directory atomically,
although the `path1` and `path2` options typically produce a similar result.)
- To maintain backward-compatibility, the `--resync` flag implies
`--resync-mode path1` unless a different `--resync-mode` is explicitly
specified. Similarly, all `--resync-mode` options (except `none`) imply
`--resync`, so it is not necessary to use both the `--resync` and
`--resync-mode` flags simultaneously -- either one is sufficient without the
other.


### --check-access

Access check files are an additional safety measure against data loss.
bisync will ensure it can find matching `RCLONE_TEST` files in the same places
in the Path1 and Path2 filesystems.
`RCLONE_TEST` files are not generated automatically.
For `--check-access` to succeed, you must first either:
**A)** Place one or more `RCLONE_TEST` files in both systems, or
**B)** Set `--check-filename` to a filename already in use in various locations
throughout your sync'd fileset. Recommended methods for **A)** include:
* `rclone touch Path1/RCLONE_TEST` (create a new file)
* `rclone copyto Path1/RCLONE_TEST Path2/RCLONE_TEST` (copy an existing file)
* `rclone copy Path1/RCLONE_TEST Path2/RCLONE_TEST  --include "RCLONE_TEST"` (copy multiple files at once, recursively)
* create the files manually (outside of rclone)
* run `bisync` once *without* `--check-access` to set matching files on both filesystems
will also work, but is not preferred, due to potential for user error 
(you are temporarily disabling the safety feature).

Note that `--check-access` is still enforced on `--resync`, so `bisync --resync --check-access` 
will not work as a method of initially setting the files (this is to ensure that bisync can't 
[inadvertently circumvent its own safety switch](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=3.%20%2D%2Dcheck%2Daccess%20doesn%27t%20always%20fail%20when%20it%20should).)

Time stamps and file contents for `RCLONE_TEST` files are not important, just the names and locations.
If you have symbolic links in your sync tree it is recommended to place
`RCLONE_TEST` files in the linked-to directory tree to protect against
bisync assuming a bunch of deleted files if the linked-to tree should not be
accessible.
See also the [--check-filename](--check-filename) flag.

### --check-filename

Name of the file(s) used in access health validation.
The default `--check-filename` is `RCLONE_TEST`.
One or more files having this filename must exist, synchronized between your
source and destination filesets, in order for `--check-access` to succeed.
See [--check-access](#check-access) for additional details.

### --compare

As of `v1.66`, bisync fully supports comparing based on any combination of
size, modtime, and checksum (lifting the prior restriction on backends without
modtime support.)

By default (without the `--compare` flag), bisync inherits the same comparison
options as `sync`
(that is: `size` and `modtime` by default, unless modified with flags such as
[`--checksum`](https://rclone.org/docs/#c-checksum) or [`--size-only`](/docs/#size-only).)

If the `--compare` flag is set, it will override these defaults. This can be
useful if you wish to compare based on combinations not currently supported in
`sync`, such as comparing all three of `size` AND `modtime` AND `checksum`
simultaneously (or just `modtime` AND `checksum`).

`--compare` takes a comma-separated list, with the currently supported values
being `size`, `modtime`, and `checksum`. For example, if you want to compare
size and checksum, but not modtime, you would do:
```
--compare size,checksum
```

Or if you want to compare all three:
```
--compare size,modtime,checksum
```

`--compare` overrides any conflicting flags. For example, if you set the
conflicting flags `--compare checksum --size-only`, `--size-only` will be
ignored, and bisync will compare checksum and not size. To avoid confusion, it
is recommended to use _either_ `--compare` or the normal `sync` flags, but not
both.

If `--compare` includes `checksum` and both remotes support checksums but have
no hash types in common with each other, checksums will be considered _only_
for comparisons within the same side (to determine what has changed since the
prior sync), but not for comparisons against the opposite side. If one side
supports checksums and the other does not, checksums will only be considered on
the side that supports them.

When comparing with `checksum` and/or `size` without `modtime`, bisync cannot
determine whether a file is `newer` or `older` -- only whether it is `changed`
or `unchanged`. (If it is `changed` on both sides, bisync still does the
standard equality-check to avoid declaring a sync conflict unless it absolutely
has to.)

It is recommended to do a `--resync` when changing `--compare` settings, as
otherwise your prior listing files may not contain the attributes you wish to
compare (for example, they will not have stored checksums if you were not
previously comparing checksums.)

### --ignore-listing-checksum

When `--checksum` or `--compare checksum` is set, bisync will retrieve (or
generate) checksums (for backends that support them) when creating the listings
for both paths, and store the checksums in the listing files.
`--ignore-listing-checksum` will disable this behavior, which may speed things
up considerably, especially on backends (such as [local](https://rclone.org/local/)) where hashes
must be computed on the fly instead of retrieved. Please note the following:

* As of `v1.66`, `--ignore-listing-checksum` is now automatically set when
neither `--checksum` nor `--compare checksum` are in use (as the checksums
would not be used for anything.)
* `--ignore-listing-checksum` is NOT the same as
[`--ignore-checksum`](https://rclone.org/docs/#ignore-checksum),
and you may wish to use one or the other, or both. In a nutshell:
`--ignore-listing-checksum` controls whether checksums are considered when
scanning for diffs,
while `--ignore-checksum` controls whether checksums are considered during the
copy/sync operations that follow,
if there ARE diffs.
* Unless `--ignore-listing-checksum` is passed, bisync currently computes
hashes for one path
*even when there's no common hash with the other path*
(for example, a [crypt](https://rclone.org/crypt/#modification-times-and-hashes) remote.)
This can still be beneficial, as the hashes will still be used to detect
changes within the same side
(if `--checksum` or `--compare checksum` is set), even if they can't be used to
compare against the opposite side.
* If you wish to ignore listing checksums _only_ on remotes where they are slow
to compute, consider using
[`--no-slow-hash`](#no-slow-hash) (or
[`--slow-hash-sync-only`](#slow-hash-sync-only)) instead of
`--ignore-listing-checksum`.
* If `--ignore-listing-checksum` is used simultaneously with `--compare
checksum` (or `--checksum`), checksums will be ignored for bisync deltas,
but still considered during the sync operations that follow (if deltas are
detected based on modtime and/or size.)

### --no-slow-hash

On some remotes (notably `local`), checksums can dramatically slow down a
bisync run, because hashes cannot be stored and need to be computed in
real-time when they are requested. On other remotes (such as `drive`), they add
practically no time at all. The `--no-slow-hash` flag will automatically skip
checksums on remotes where they are slow, while still comparing them on others
(assuming [`--compare`](#compare) includes `checksum`.) This can be useful when one of your
bisync paths is slow but you still want to check checksums on the other, for a more
robust sync.

### --slow-hash-sync-only

Same as [`--no-slow-hash`](#no-slow-hash), except slow hashes are still
considered during sync calls. They are still NOT considered for determining
deltas, nor or they included in listings. They are also skipped during
`--resync`. The main use case for this flag is when you have a large number of
files, but relatively few of them change from run to run -- so you don't want
to check your entire tree every time (it would take too long), but you still
want to consider checksums for the smaller group of files for which a `modtime`
or `size` change was detected. Keep in mind that this speed savings comes with
a safety trade-off: if a file's content were to change without a change to its
`modtime` or `size`, bisync would not detect it, and it would not be synced.

`--slow-hash-sync-only` is only useful if both remotes share a common hash
type (if they don't, bisync will automatically fall back to `--no-slow-hash`.)
Both `--no-slow-hash` and `--slow-hash-sync-only` have no effect without
`--compare checksum` (or `--checksum`).

### --download-hash

If `--download-hash` is set, bisync will use best efforts to obtain an MD5
checksum by downloading and computing on-the-fly, when checksums are not
otherwise available (for example, a remote that doesn't support them.) Note
that since rclone has to download the entire file, this may dramatically slow
down your bisync runs, and is also likely to use a lot of data, so it is
probably not practical for bisync paths with a large total file size. However,
it can be a good option for syncing small-but-important files with maximum
accuracy (for example, a source code repo on a `crypt` remote.) An additional
advantage over methods like [`cryptcheck`](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_cryptcheck/) is
that the original file is not required for comparison (for example,
`--download-hash` can be used to bisync two different crypt remotes with
different passwords.)

When `--download-hash` is set, bisync still looks for more efficient checksums
first, and falls back to downloading only when none are found. It takes
priority over conflicting flags such as `--no-slow-hash`. `--download-hash` is
not suitable for [Google Docs](#gdocs) and other files of unknown size, as
their checksums would change from run to run (due to small variances in the
internals of the generated export file.) Therefore, bisync automatically skips
`--download-hash` for files with a size less than 0.

See also: [`Hasher`](https://rclone.org/hasher/) backend,
[`cryptcheck`](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_cryptcheck/) command, [`rclone check
--download`](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/) option,
[`md5sum`](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_md5sum/) command

### --max-delete

As a safety check, if greater than the `--max-delete` percent of files were
deleted on either the Path1 or Path2 filesystem, then bisync will abort with
a warning message, without making any changes.
The default `--max-delete` is `50%`.
One way to trigger this limit is to rename a directory that contains more
than half of your files. This will appear to bisync as a bunch of deleted
files and a bunch of new files.
This safety check is intended to block bisync from deleting all of the
files on both filesystems due to a temporary network access issue, or if
the user had inadvertently deleted the files on one side or the other.
To force the sync, either set a different delete percentage limit,
e.g. `--max-delete 75` (allows up to 75% deletion), or use `--force`
to bypass the check.

Also see the [all files changed](#all-files-changed) check.

### --filters-file {#filters-file}

By using rclone filter features you can exclude file types or directory
sub-trees from the sync.
See the [bisync filters](#filtering) section and generic
[--filter-from](https://rclone.org/filtering/#filter-from-read-filtering-patterns-from-a-file)
documentation.
An [example filters file](#example-filters-file) contains filters for
non-allowed files for synching with Dropbox.

If you make changes to your filters file then bisync requires a run
with `--resync`. This is a safety feature, which prevents existing files
on the Path1 and/or Path2 side from seeming to disappear from view
(since they are excluded in the new listings), which would fool bisync
into seeing them as deleted (as compared to the prior run listings),
and then bisync would proceed to delete them for real.

To block this from happening, bisync calculates an MD5 hash of the filters file
and stores the hash in a `.md5` file in the same place as your filters file.
On the next run with `--filters-file` set, bisync re-calculates the MD5 hash
of the current filters file and compares it to the hash stored in the `.md5` file.
If they don't match, the run aborts with a critical error and thus forces you
to do a `--resync`, likely avoiding a disaster.

### --conflict-resolve CHOICE {#conflict-resolve}

In bisync, a "conflict" is a file that is *new* or *changed* on *both sides*
(relative to the prior run) AND is *not currently identical* on both sides.
`--conflict-resolve` controls how bisync handles such a scenario. The currently
supported options are:

- `none` - (the default) - do not attempt to pick a winner, keep and rename
both files according to [`--conflict-loser`](#conflict-loser) and
[`--conflict-suffix`](#conflict-suffix) settings. For example, with the default
settings, `file.txt` on Path1 is renamed `file.txt.conflict1` and `file.txt` on
Path2 is renamed `file.txt.conflict2`. Both are copied to the opposite path
during the run, so both sides end up with a copy of both files. (As `none` is
the default, it is not necessary to specify `--conflict-resolve none` -- you
can just omit the flag.)
- `newer` - the newer file (by `modtime`) is considered the winner and is
copied without renaming. The older file (the "loser") is handled according to
`--conflict-loser` and `--conflict-suffix` settings (either renamed or
deleted.) For example, if `file.txt` on Path1 is newer than `file.txt` on
Path2, the result on both sides (with other default settings) will be `file.txt`
(winner from Path1) and `file.txt.conflict1` (loser from Path2).
- `older` - same as `newer`, except the older file is considered the winner,
and the newer file is considered the loser.
- `larger` - the larger file (by `size`) is considered the winner (regardless
of `modtime`, if any).
- `smaller` - the smaller file (by `size`) is considered the winner (regardless
of `modtime`, if any).
- `path1` - the version from Path1 is unconditionally considered the winner
(regardless of `modtime` and `size`, if any). This can be useful if one side is
usually more trusted or up-to-date than the other.
- `path2` - same as `path1`, except the path2 version is considered the
winner.

For all of the above options, note the following:
- If either of the underlying remotes lacks support for the chosen method, it
will be ignored and fall back to `none`. (For example, if `--conflict-resolve
newer` is set, but one of the paths uses a remote that doesn't support
`modtime`.)
- If a winner can't be determined because the chosen method's attribute is
missing or equal, it will be ignored and fall back to `none`. (For example, if
`--conflict-resolve newer` is set, but the Path1 and Path2 modtimes are
identical, even if the sizes may differ.)
- If the file's content is currently identical on both sides, it is not
considered a "conflict", even if new or changed on both sides since the prior
sync. (For example, if you made a change on one side and then synced it to the
other side by other means.) Therefore, none of the conflict resolution flags
apply in this scenario.
- The conflict resolution flags do not apply during a `--resync`, as there is
no "prior run" to speak of (but see [`--resync-mode`](#resync-mode) for similar
options.)

### --conflict-loser CHOICE {#conflict-loser}

`--conflict-loser` determines what happens to the "loser" of a sync conflict
(when [`--conflict-resolve`](#conflict-resolve) determines a winner) or to both
files (when there is no winner.) The currently supported options are:

- `num` - (the default) - auto-number the conflicts by automatically appending
the next available number to the `--conflict-suffix`, in chronological order.
For example, with the default settings, the first conflict for `file.txt` will
be renamed `file.txt.conflict1`. If `file.txt.conflict1` already exists,
`file.txt.conflict2` will be used instead (etc., up to a maximum of
9223372036854775807 conflicts.)
- `pathname` - rename the conflicts according to which side they came from,
which was the default behavior prior to `v1.66`. For example, with
`--conflict-suffix path`, `file.txt` from Path1 will be renamed
`file.txt.path1`, and `file.txt` from Path2 will be renamed `file.txt.path2`.
If two non-identical suffixes are provided (ex. `--conflict-suffix
cloud,local`), the trailing digit is omitted. Importantly, note that with
`pathname`, there is no auto-numbering beyond `2`, so if `file.txt.path2`
somehow already exists, it will be overwritten. Using a dynamic date variable
in your `--conflict-suffix` (see below) is one possible way to avoid this. Note
also that conflicts-of-conflicts are possible, if the original conflict is not
manually resolved -- for example, if for some reason you edited
`file.txt.path1` on both sides, and those edits were different, the result
would be `file.txt.path1.path1` and `file.txt.path1.path2` (in addition to
`file.txt.path2`.)
- `delete` - keep the winner only and delete the loser, instead of renaming it.
If a winner cannot be determined (see `--conflict-resolve` for details on how
this could happen), `delete` is ignored and the default `num` is used instead
(i.e. both versions are kept and renamed, and neither is deleted.) `delete` is
inherently the most destructive option, so use it only with care.

For all of the above options, note that if a winner cannot be determined (see
`--conflict-resolve` for details on how this could happen), or if
`--conflict-resolve` is not in use, *both* files will be renamed.

### --conflict-suffix STRING[,STRING] {#conflict-suffix}

`--conflict-suffix` controls the suffix that is appended when bisync renames a
[`--conflict-loser`](#conflict-loser) (default: `conflict`).
`--conflict-suffix` will accept either one string or two comma-separated
strings to assign different suffixes to Path1 vs. Path2. This may be helpful
later in identifying the source of the conflict. (For example,
`--conflict-suffix dropboxconflict,laptopconflict`)

With `--conflict-loser num`, a number is always appended to the suffix. With
`--conflict-loser pathname`, a number is appended only when one suffix is
specified (or when two identical suffixes are specified.) i.e. with
`--conflict-loser pathname`, all of the following would produce exactly the
same result:

```
--conflict-suffix path
--conflict-suffix path,path
--conflict-suffix path1,path2
```

Suffixes may be as short as 1 character. By default, the suffix is appended
after any other extensions (ex. `file.jpg.conflict1`), however, this can be
changed with the [`--suffix-keep-extension`](https://rclone.org/docs/#suffix-keep-extension) flag
(i.e. to instead result in `file.conflict1.jpg`).

`--conflict-suffix` supports several *dynamic date variables* when enclosed in
curly braces as globs. This can be helpful to track the date and/or time that
each conflict was handled by bisync. For example:

```
--conflict-suffix {DateOnly}-conflict
// result: myfile.txt.2006-01-02-conflict1
```

All of the formats described [here](https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants) and
[here](https://pkg.go.dev/time#example-Time.Format) are supported, but take
care to ensure that your chosen format does not use any characters that are
illegal on your remotes (for example, macOS does not allow colons in
filenames, and slashes are also best avoided as they are often interpreted as
directory separators.) To address this particular issue, an additional
`{MacFriendlyTime}` (or just `{mac}`) option is supported, which results in
`2006-01-02 0304PM`.

Note that `--conflict-suffix` is entirely separate from rclone's main
[`--sufix`](https://rclone.org/docs/#suffix-suffix) flag. This is intentional, as users may wish
to use both flags simultaneously, if also using
[`--backup-dir`](#backup-dir1-and-backup-dir2).

Finally, note that the default in bisync prior to `v1.66` was to rename
conflicts with `..path1` and `..path2` (with two periods, and `path` instead of
`conflict`.) Bisync now defaults to a single dot instead of a double dot, but
additional dots can be added by including them in the specified suffix string.
For example, for behavior equivalent to the previous default, use:

```
[--conflict-resolve none] --conflict-loser pathname --conflict-suffix .path
```

### --check-sync

Enabled by default, the check-sync function checks that all of the same
files exist in both the Path1 and Path2 history listings. This _check-sync_
integrity check is performed at the end of the sync run by default.
Any untrapped failing copy/deletes between the two paths might result
in differences between the two listings and in the untracked file content
differences between the two paths. A resync run would correct the error.

Note that the default-enabled integrity check locally executes a load of both
the final Path1 and Path2 listings, and thus adds to the run time of a sync.
Using `--check-sync=false` will disable it and may significantly reduce the
sync run times for very large numbers of files.

The check may be run manually with `--check-sync=only`. It runs only the
integrity check and terminates without actually synching.

Note that currently, `--check-sync` **only checks listing snapshots and NOT the
actual files on the remotes.** Note also that the listing snapshots will not
know about any changes that happened during or after the latest bisync run, as
those will be discovered on the next run. Therefore, while listings should
always match _each other_ at the end of a bisync run, it is _expected_ that
they will not match the underlying remotes, nor will the remotes match each
other, if there were changes during or after the run. This is normal, and any
differences will be detected and synced on the next run.

For a robust integrity check of the current state of the remotes (as opposed to just their listing snapshots), consider using [`check`](commands/rclone_check/)
(or [`cryptcheck`](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_cryptcheck/), if at least one path is a `crypt` remote) instead of `--check-sync`, 
keeping in mind that differences are expected if files changed during or after your last bisync run.

For example, a possible sequence could look like this:

1. Normally scheduled bisync run:

```
rclone bisync Path1 Path2 -MPc --check-access --max-delete 10 --filters-file /path/to/filters.txt -v --no-cleanup --ignore-listing-checksum --disable ListR --checkers=16 --drive-pacer-min-sleep=10ms --create-empty-src-dirs --resilient
```

2. Periodic independent integrity check (perhaps scheduled nightly or weekly):

```
rclone check -MvPc Path1 Path2 --filter-from /path/to/filters.txt
```

3. If diffs are found, you have some choices to correct them.
If one side is more up-to-date and you want to make the other side match it, you could run:

```
rclone sync Path1 Path2 --filter-from /path/to/filters.txt --create-empty-src-dirs -MPc -v
```
(or switch Path1 and Path2 to make Path2 the source-of-truth)

Or, if neither side is totally up-to-date, you could run a `--resync` to bring them back into agreement
(but remember that this could cause deleted files to re-appear.)

*Note also that `rclone check` does not currently include empty directories,
so if you want to know if any empty directories are out of sync,
consider alternatively running the above `rclone sync` command with `--dry-run` added.

### --resilient

***Caution: this is an experimental feature. Use at your own risk!***

By default, most errors or interruptions will cause bisync to abort and
require [`--resync`](#resync) to recover. This is a safety feature,  to prevent
bisync from running again until a user checks things out.  However, in some
cases, bisync can go too far and enforce a lockout when one isn't actually
necessary,  like for certain less-serious errors that might resolve themselves
on the next run.  When `--resilient` is specified, bisync tries its best to
recover and self-correct,  and only requires `--resync` as a last resort when a
human's involvement is absolutely necessary.  The intended use case is for
running bisync as a background process (such as via scheduled [cron](#cron)).

When using `--resilient` mode, bisync will still report the error and abort,
however it will not lock out future runs -- allowing the possibility of
retrying at the next normally scheduled time,  without requiring a `--resync`
first. Examples of such retryable errors include  access test failures, missing
listing files, and filter change detections.  These safety features will still
prevent the *current* run from proceeding --  the difference is that if
conditions have improved by the time of the *next* run,  that next run will be
allowed to proceed.  Certain more serious errors will still enforce a
`--resync` lockout, even in `--resilient` mode, to prevent data loss.

Behavior of `--resilient` may change in a future version. (See also:
[`--recover`](#recover), [`--max-lock`](#max-lock), [Graceful
Shutdown](#graceful-shutdown))

### --recover

If `--recover` is set, in the event of a sudden interruption or other
un-graceful shutdown, bisync will attempt to automatically recover on the next
run, instead of requiring `--resync`. Bisync is able to recover robustly by
keeping one "backup" listing at all times, representing the state of both paths
after the last known successful sync. Bisync can then compare the current state
with this snapshot to determine which changes it needs to retry. Changes that
were synced after this snapshot (during the run that was later interrupted)
will appear to bisync as if they are "new or changed on both sides", but in
most cases this is not a problem, as bisync will simply do its usual "equality
check" and learn that no action needs to be taken on these files, since they
are already identical on both sides.

In the rare event that a file is synced successfully during a run that later
aborts, and then that same file changes AGAIN before the next run, bisync will
think it is a sync conflict, and handle it accordingly. (From bisync's
perspective, the file has changed on both sides since the last trusted sync,
and the files on either side are not currently identical.) Therefore,
`--recover` carries with it a slightly increased chance of having conflicts --
though in practice this is pretty rare, as the conditions required to cause it
are quite specific. This risk can be reduced by using bisync's ["Graceful
Shutdown"](#graceful-shutdown) mode (triggered by sending `SIGINT` or
`Ctrl+C`), when you have the choice, instead of forcing a sudden termination.

`--recover` and `--resilient` are similar, but distinct -- the main difference
is that `--resilient` is about _retrying_, while `--recover` is about
_recovering_. Most users will probably want both. `--resilient` allows retrying
when bisync has chosen to abort itself due to safety features such as failing
`--check-access` or detecting a filter change. `--resilient` does not cover
external interruptions such as a user shutting down their computer in the
middle of a sync -- that is what `--recover` is for.

### --max-lock

Bisync uses [lock files](#lock-file) as a safety feature to prevent
interference from other bisync runs while it is running. Bisync normally
removes these lock files at the end of a run, but if bisync is abruptly
interrupted, these files will be left behind. By default, they will lock out
all future runs, until the user has a chance to manually check things out and
remove the lock. As an alternative, `--max-lock` can be used to make them
automatically expire after a certain period of time, so that future runs are
not locked out forever, and auto-recovery is possible. `--max-lock` can be any
duration `2m` or greater (or `0` to disable). If set, lock files older than
this will be considered "expired", and future runs will be allowed to disregard
them and proceed. (Note that the `--max-lock` duration must be set by the
process that left the lock file -- not the later one interpreting it.)

If set, bisync will also "renew" these lock files every `--max-lock minus one
minute` throughout a run, for extra safety. (For example, with `--max-lock 5m`,
bisync would renew the lock file (for another 5 minutes) every 4 minutes until
the run has completed.) In other words, it should not be possible for a lock
file to pass its expiration time while the process that created it is still
running -- and you can therefore be reasonably sure that any _expired_ lock
file you may find was left there by an interrupted run, not one that is still
running and just taking awhile.

If `--max-lock` is `0` or not set, the default is that lock files will never
expire, and will block future runs (of these same two bisync paths)
indefinitely.

For maximum resilience from disruptions, consider setting a relatively short
duration like `--max-lock 2m` along with [`--resilient`](#resilient) and
[`--recover`](#recover), and a relatively frequent [cron schedule](#cron). The
result will be a very robust "set-it-and-forget-it" bisync run that can
automatically bounce back from almost any interruption it might encounter,
without requiring the user to get involved and run a `--resync`. (See also:
[Graceful Shutdown](#graceful-shutdown) mode)


### --backup-dir1 and --backup-dir2

As of `v1.66`, [`--backup-dir`](https://rclone.org/docs/#backup-dir-dir) is supported in bisync.
Because `--backup-dir` must be a non-overlapping path on the same remote,
Bisync has introduced new `--backup-dir1` and `--backup-dir2` flags to support
separate backup-dirs for `Path1` and `Path2` (bisyncing between different
remotes with `--backup-dir` would not otherwise be possible.) `--backup-dir1`
and `--backup-dir2` can use different remotes from each other, but
`--backup-dir1` must use the same remote as `Path1`, and `--backup-dir2` must
use the same remote as `Path2`. Each backup directory must not overlap its
respective bisync Path without being excluded by a filter rule.

The standard `--backup-dir` will also work, if both paths use the same remote
(but note that deleted files from both paths would be mixed together in the
same dir). If either `--backup-dir1` and `--backup-dir2` are set, they will
override `--backup-dir`.

Example:
```
rclone bisync /Users/someuser/some/local/path/Bisync gdrive:Bisync --backup-dir1 /Users/someuser/some/local/path/BackupDir --backup-dir2 gdrive:BackupDir --suffix -2023-08-26 --suffix-keep-extension --check-access --max-delete 10 --filters-file /Users/someuser/some/local/path/bisync_filters.txt --no-cleanup --ignore-listing-checksum --checkers=16 --drive-pacer-min-sleep=10ms --create-empty-src-dirs --resilient -MvP --drive-skip-gdocs --fix-case
```

In this example, if the user deletes a file in
`/Users/someuser/some/local/path/Bisync`, bisync will propagate the delete to
the other side by moving the corresponding file from `gdrive:Bisync` to
`gdrive:BackupDir`. If the user deletes a file from `gdrive:Bisync`, bisync
moves it from `/Users/someuser/some/local/path/Bisync` to
`/Users/someuser/some/local/path/BackupDir`.

In the event of a [rename due to a sync conflict](#conflict-loser), the
rename is not considered a delete, unless a previous conflict with the same
name already exists and would get overwritten.

[`--suffix-keep-extension`](https://rclone.org/docs/#suffix-keep-extension)

## Operation

### Runtime flow details

bisync retains the listings of the `Path1` and `Path2` filesystems
from the prior run.
On each successive run it will:

- list files on `path1` and `path2`, and check for changes on each side.
  Changes include `New`, `Newer`, `Older`, and `Deleted` files.
- Propagate changes on `path1` to `path2`, and vice-versa.

### Safety measures

- Lock file prevents multiple simultaneous runs when taking a while.
  This can be particularly useful if bisync is run by cron scheduler.
- Handle change conflicts non-destructively by creating
  `.conflict1`, `.conflict2`, etc. file versions, according to
  [`--conflict-resolve`](#conflict-resolve), [`--conflict-loser`](#conflict-loser), and [`--conflict-suffix`](#conflict-suffix) settings.
- File system access health check using `RCLONE_TEST` files
  (see the `--check-access` flag).
- Abort on excessive deletes - protects against a failed listing
  being interpreted as all the files were deleted.
  See the `--max-delete` and `--force` flags.
- If something evil happens, bisync goes into a safe state to block
  damage by later runs. (See [Error Handling](#error-handling))

Path2 newer AND Path1 changed   | File is newer on Path2 AND also changed (newer/older/size) on Path1 (and Path1 version is NOT identical to Path2) | Conflicts handled according to [`--conflict-resolve`](#conflict-resolve) & [`--conflict-loser`](#conflict-loser) settings | default: `rclone copy` renamed `Path2.conflict2` file to Path1, `rclone copy` renamed `Path1.conflict1` file to Path2
Path2 newer AND Path1 deleted   | File is newer on Path2 AND also deleted on Path1 | Path2 version survives  | `rclone copy` Path2 to Path1

Path1 deleted AND Path2 changed | File is deleted on Path1 AND changed (newer/older/size) on Path2 | Path2 version survives  | `rclone copy` Path2 to Path1

As of `rclone v1.64`, bisync is now better at detecting *false positive* sync conflicts, 
which would previously have resulted in unnecessary renames and duplicates. 
Now, when bisync comes to a file that it wants to rename (because it is new/changed on both sides), 
it first checks whether the Path1 and Path2 versions are currently *identical* 
(using the same underlying function as [`check`](commands/rclone_check/).) 
If bisync concludes that the files are identical, it will skip them and move on. 
Otherwise, it will create renamed duplicates, as before.
This behavior also [improves the experience of renaming directories](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=Renamed%20directories), 
as a `--resync` is no longer required, so long as the same change has been made on both sides.

### All files changed check {#all-files-changed}

If _all_ prior existing files on either of the filesystems have changed
(e.g. timestamps have changed due to changing the system's timezone)
then bisync will abort without making any changes.
Any new files are not considered for this check. You could use `--force`
to force the sync (whichever side has the changed timestamp files wins).
Alternately, a `--resync` may be used (Path1 versions will be pushed
to Path2). Consider the situation carefully and perhaps use `--dry-run`
before you commit to the changes.

### Modification times

By default, bisync compares files by modification time and size.
If you or your application should change the content of a file
without changing the modification time and size, then bisync will _not_
notice the change, and thus will not copy it to the other side.
As an alternative, consider comparing by checksum (if your remotes support it).
See [`--compare`](#compare) for details.

### Error handling {#error-handling}

Certain bisync critical errors, such as file copy/move failing, will result in
a bisync lockout of following runs. The lockout is asserted because the sync
status and history of the Path1 and Path2 filesystems cannot be trusted,
so it is safer to block any further changes until someone checks things out.
The recovery is to do a `--resync` again.

It is recommended to use `--resync --dry-run --verbose` initially and
_carefully_ review what changes will be made before running the `--resync`
without `--dry-run`.

Most of these events come up due to an error status from an internal call.
On such a critical error the `{...}.path1.lst` and `{...}.path2.lst`
listing files are renamed to extension `.lst-err`, which blocks any future
bisync runs (since the normal `.lst` files are not found).
Bisync keeps them under `bisync` subdirectory of the rclone cache directory,
typically at `${HOME}/.cache/rclone/bisync/` on Linux.

Some errors are considered temporary and re-running the bisync is not blocked.
The _critical return_ blocks further bisync runs.

See also: [`--resilient`](#resilient), [`--recover`](#recover),
[`--max-lock`](#max-lock), [Graceful Shutdown](#graceful-shutdown)

### Lock file

When bisync is running, a lock file is created in the bisync working directory,
typically at `~/.cache/rclone/bisync/PATH1..PATH2.lck` on Linux.
If bisync should crash or hang, the lock file will remain in place and block
any further runs of bisync _for the same paths_.
Delete the lock file as part of debugging the situation.
The lock file effectively blocks follow-on (e.g., scheduled by _cron_) runs
when the prior invocation is taking a long time.
The lock file contains _PID_ of the blocking process, which may help in debug.
Lock files can be set to automatically expire after a certain amount of time,
using the [`--max-lock`](#max-lock) flag.

**Note**
that while concurrent bisync runs are allowed, _be very cautious_
that there is no overlap in the trees being synched between concurrent runs,
lest there be replicated files, deleted files and general mayhem.

### Return codes

`rclone bisync` returns the following codes to calling program:
- `0` on a successful run,
- `1` for a non-critical failing run (a rerun may be successful),
- `2` for a critically aborted run (requires a `--resync` to recover).

### Graceful Shutdown

Bisync has a "Graceful Shutdown" mode which is activated by sending `SIGINT` or
pressing `Ctrl+C` during a run. Once triggered, bisync will use best efforts to
exit cleanly before the timer runs out. If bisync is in the middle of
transferring files, it will attempt to cleanly empty its queue by finishing
what it has started but not taking more. If it cannot do so within 30 seconds,
it will cancel the in-progress transfers at that point and then give itself a
maximum of 60 seconds to wrap up, save its state for next time, and exit. With
the `-vP` flags you will see constant status updates and a final confirmation
of whether or not the graceful shutdown was successful.

At any point during the "Graceful Shutdown" sequence, a second `SIGINT` or
`Ctrl+C` will trigger an immediate, un-graceful exit, which will leave things
in a messier state. Usually a robust recovery will still be possible if using
[`--recover`](#recover) mode, otherwise you will need to do a `--resync`.

If you plan to use Graceful Shutdown mode, it is recommended to use
[`--resilient`](#resilient) and [`--recover`](#recover), and it is important to
NOT use [`--inplace`](https://rclone.org/docs/#inplace), otherwise you risk leaving
partially-written files on one side, which may be confused for real files on
the next run. Note also that in the event of an abrupt interruption, a [lock
file](#lock-file) will be left behind to block concurrent runs. You will need
to delete it before you can proceed with the next run (or wait for it to
expire on its own, if using `--max-lock`.)

## Limitations

### Supported backends

Bisync is considered _BETA_ and has been tested with the following backends:
- Local filesystem
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- OneDrive
- S3
- SFTP
- Yandex Disk
- Crypt

It has not been fully tested with other services yet.
If it works, or sorta works, please let us know and we'll update the list.
Run the test suite to check for proper operation as described below.

The first release of `rclone bisync` required both underlying backends to support
modification times, and refused to run otherwise.
This limitation has been lifted as of `v1.66`, as bisync now supports comparing 
checksum and/or size instead of (or in addition to) modtime.
See [`--compare`](#compare) for details.

### Concurrent modifications

When using **Local, FTP or SFTP** remotes with [`--inplace`](https://rclone.org/docs/#inplace), rclone does not create _temporary_
files at the destination when copying, and thus if the connection is lost
the created file may be corrupt, which will likely propagate back to the
original path on the next sync, resulting in data loss.
It is therefore recommended to _omit_ `--inplace`.

Files that **change during** a bisync run may result in data loss.
Prior to `rclone v1.66`, this was commonly seen in highly dynamic environments, where the filesystem
was getting hammered by running processes during the sync.
As of `rclone v1.66`, bisync was redesigned to use a "snapshot" model,
greatly reducing the risks from changes during a sync.
Changes that are not detected during the current sync will now be detected during the following sync,
and will no longer cause the entire run to throw a critical error.
There is additionally a mechanism to mark files as needing to be internally rechecked next time, for added safety.
It should therefore no longer be necessary to sync only at quiet times --
however, note that an error can still occur if a file happens to change at the exact moment it's
being read/written by bisync (same as would happen in `rclone sync`.)
(See also: [`--ignore-checksum`](https://rclone.org/docs/#ignore-checksum),
[`--local-no-check-updated`](https://rclone.org/local/#local-no-check-updated))

### Empty directories

By default, new/deleted empty directories on one path are _not_ propagated to the other side.
This is because bisync (and rclone) natively works on files, not directories.
However, this can be changed with the `--create-empty-src-dirs` flag, which works in
much the same way as in [`sync`](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/) and [`copy`](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/).
When used, empty directories created or deleted on one side will also be created or deleted on the other side.
The following should be noted:
* `--create-empty-src-dirs` is not compatible with `--remove-empty-dirs`. Use only one or the other (or neither).
* It is not recommended to switch back and forth between `--create-empty-src-dirs` 
and the default (no `--create-empty-src-dirs`) without running `--resync`. 
This is because it may appear as though all directories (not just the empty ones) were created/deleted,
when actually you've just toggled between making them visible/invisible to bisync. 
It looks scarier than it is, but it's still probably best to stick to one or the other, 
and use `--resync` when you need to switch.

### Renamed directories

By default, renaming a folder on the Path1 side results in deleting all files on
the Path2 side and then copying all files again from Path1 to Path2.
Bisync sees this as all files in the old directory name as deleted and all
files in the new directory name as new. 

A recommended solution is to use [`--track-renames`](https://rclone.org/docs/#track-renames),
which is now supported in bisync as of `rclone v1.66`.
Note that `--track-renames` is not available during `--resync`,
as `--resync` does not delete anything (`--track-renames` only supports `sync`, not `copy`.)

Otherwise, the most effective and efficient method of renaming a directory
is to rename it to the same name on both sides. (As of `rclone v1.64`, 
a `--resync` is no longer required after doing so, as bisync will automatically
detect that Path1 and Path2 are in agreement.)

### `--fast-list` used by default

Unlike most other rclone commands, bisync uses [`--fast-list`](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) by default, 
for backends that support it. In many cases this is desirable, however, 
there are some scenarios in which bisync could be faster *without* `--fast-list`, 
and there is also a [known issue concerning Google Drive users with many empty directories](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/cbf3d4356135814921382dd3285d859d15d0aa77). 
For now, the recommended way to avoid using `--fast-list` is to add `--disable ListR` 
to all bisync commands. The default behavior may change in a future version.

### Case (and unicode) sensitivity {#case-sensitivity}

As of `v1.66`, case and unicode form differences no longer cause critical errors,
and normalization (when comparing between filesystems) is handled according to the same flags and defaults as `rclone sync`.
See the following options (all of which are supported by bisync) to control this behavior more granularly:
- [`--fix-case`](https://rclone.org/docs/#fix-case)
- [`--ignore-case-sync`](https://rclone.org/docs/#ignore-case-sync)
- [`--no-unicode-normalization`](https://rclone.org/docs/#no-unicode-normalization)
- [`--local-unicode-normalization`](https://rclone.org/local/#local-unicode-normalization) and
[`--local-case-sensitive`](https://rclone.org/local/#local-case-sensitive) (caution: these are normally not what you want.)

Note that in the (probably rare) event that `--fix-case` is used AND a file is new/changed on both sides 
AND the checksums match AND the filename case does not match, the Path1 filename is considered the winner, 
for the purposes of `--fix-case` (Path2 will be renamed to match it).

## Windows support {#windows}

Bisync has been tested on Windows 8.1, Windows 10 Pro 64-bit and on Windows
GitHub runners.

Drive letters are allowed, including drive letters mapped to network drives
(`rclone bisync J:\localsync GDrive:`).
If a drive letter is omitted, the shell current drive is the default.
Drive letters are a single character follows by `:`, so cloud names
must be more than one character long.

Absolute paths (with or without a drive letter), and relative paths
(with or without a drive letter) are supported.

Working directory is created at `C:\Users\MyLogin\AppData\Local\rclone\bisync`.

Note that bisync output may show a mix of forward `/` and back `\` slashes.

Be careful of case independent directory and file naming on Windows
vs. case dependent Linux

## Filtering {#filtering}

See [filtering documentation](https://rclone.org/filtering/)
for how filter rules are written and interpreted.

Bisync's [`--filters-file`](#filters-file) flag slightly extends the rclone's
[--filter-from](https://rclone.org/filtering/#filter-from-read-filtering-patterns-from-a-file)
filtering mechanism.
For a given bisync run you may provide _only one_ `--filters-file`.
The `--include*`, `--exclude*`, and `--filter` flags are also supported.

### How to filter directories

Filtering portions of the directory tree is a critical feature for synching.

Examples of directory trees (always beneath the Path1/Path2 root level)
you may want to exclude from your sync:
- Directory trees containing only software build intermediate files.
- Directory trees containing application temporary files and data
  such as the Windows `C:\Users\MyLogin\AppData\` tree.
- Directory trees containing files that are large, less important,
  or are getting thrashed continuously by ongoing processes.

On the other hand, there may be only select directories that you
actually want to sync, and exclude all others. See the
[Example include-style filters for Windows user directories](#include-filters)
below.

### Filters file writing guidelines

1. Begin with excluding directory trees:
    - e.g. `- /AppData/`
    - `**` on the end is not necessary. Once a given directory level
      is excluded then everything beneath it won't be looked at by rclone.
    - Exclude such directories that are unneeded, are big, dynamically thrashed,
      or where there may be access permission issues.
    - Excluding such dirs first will make rclone operations (much) faster.
    - Specific files may also be excluded, as with the Dropbox exclusions
      example below.
2. Decide if it's easier (or cleaner) to:
    - Include select directories and therefore _exclude everything else_ -- or --
    - Exclude select directories and therefore _include everything else_
3. Include select directories:
    - Add lines like: `+ /Documents/PersonalFiles/**` to select which
      directories to include in the sync.
    - `**` on the end specifies to include the full depth of the specified tree.
    - With Include-style filters, files at the Path1/Path2 root are not included.
      They may be included with `+ /*`.
    - Place RCLONE_TEST files within these included directory trees.
      They will only be looked for in these directory trees.
    - Finish by excluding everything else by adding `- **` at the end
      of the filters file.
    - Disregard step 4.
4. Exclude select directories:
    - Add more lines like in step 1.
      For example: `-/Desktop/tempfiles/`, or `- /testdir/`.
      Again, a `**` on the end is not necessary.
    - Do _not_ add a `- **` in the file. Without this line, everything
      will be included that has not been explicitly excluded.
    - Disregard step 3.

A few rules for the syntax of a filter file expanding on
[filtering documentation](https://rclone.org/filtering/):

- Lines may start with spaces and tabs - rclone strips leading whitespace.
- If the first non-whitespace character is a `#` then the line is a comment
  and will be ignored.
- Blank lines are ignored.
- The first non-whitespace character on a filter line must be a `+` or `-`.
- Exactly 1 space is allowed between the `+/-` and the path term.
- Only forward slashes (`/`) are used in path terms, even on Windows.
- The rest of the line is taken as the path term.
  Trailing whitespace is taken literally, and probably is an error.

### Example include-style filters for Windows user directories {#include-filters}

This Windows _include-style_ example is based on the sync root (Path1)
set to `C:\Users\MyLogin`. The strategy is to select specific directories
to be synched with a network drive (Path2).

- `- /AppData/` excludes an entire tree of Windows stored stuff
  that need not be synched.
  In my case, AppData has >11 GB of stuff I don't care about, and there are
  some subdirectories beneath AppData that are not accessible to my
  user login, resulting in bisync critical aborts.
- Windows creates cache files starting with both upper and
  lowercase `NTUSER` at `C:\Users\MyLogin`. These files may be dynamic,
  locked, and are generally _don't care_.
- There are just a few directories with _my_ data that I do want synched,
  in the form of `+ /<path>`. By selecting only the directory trees I
  want to avoid the dozen plus directories that various apps make
  at `C:\Users\MyLogin\Documents`.
- Include files in the root of the sync point, `C:\Users\MyLogin`,
  by adding the `+ /*` line.
- This is an Include-style filters file, therefore it ends with `- **`
  which excludes everything not explicitly included.

```
- /AppData/
- NTUSER*
- ntuser*
+ /Documents/Family/**
+ /Documents/Sketchup/**
+ /Documents/Microcapture_Photo/**
+ /Documents/Microcapture_Video/**
+ /Desktop/**
+ /Pictures/**
+ /*
- **
```

Note also that Windows implements several "library" links such as
`C:\Users\MyLogin\My Documents\My Music` pointing to `C:\Users\MyLogin\Music`.
rclone sees these as links, so you must add `--links` to the
bisync command line if you which to follow these links. I find that I get
permission errors in trying to follow the links, so I don't include the
rclone `--links` flag, but then you get lots of `Can't follow symlink…`
noise from rclone about not following the links. This noise can be
quashed by adding `--quiet` to the bisync command line.

## Example exclude-style filters files for use with Dropbox {#exclude-filters}

- Dropbox disallows synching the listed temporary and configuration/data files.
  The `- <filename>` filters exclude these files where ever they may occur
  in the sync tree. Consider adding similar exclusions for file types
  you don't need to sync, such as core dump and software build files.
- bisync testing creates `/testdir/` at the top level of the sync tree,
  and usually deletes the tree after the test. If a normal sync should run
  while the `/testdir/` tree exists the `--check-access` phase may fail
  due to unbalanced RCLONE_TEST files.
  The `- /testdir/` filter blocks this tree from being synched.
  You don't need this exclusion if you are not doing bisync development testing.
- Everything else beneath the Path1/Path2 root will be synched.
- RCLONE_TEST files may be placed anywhere within the tree, including the root.

### Example filters file for Dropbox {#example-filters-file}

# Other example filters

#- /Photos/
```

### How --check-access handles filters

At the start of a bisync run, listings are gathered for Path1 and Path2
while using the user's `--filters-file`. During the check access phase,
bisync scans these listings for `RCLONE_TEST` files.
Any `RCLONE_TEST` files hidden by the `--filters-file` are _not_ in the
listings and thus not checked during the check access phase.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### Reading bisync logs

Here are two normal runs. The first one has a newer file on the remote.
The second has no deltas between local and remote.

```
2021/05/16 00:24:38 INFO  : Synching Path1 "/path/to/local/tree/" with Path2 "dropbox:/"
2021/05/16 00:24:38 INFO  : Path1 checking for diffs

2021/05/16 00:36:52 INFO  : Bisync successful
```

### Dry run oddity

The `--dry-run` messages may indicate that it would try to delete some files.
For example, if a file is new on Path2 and does not exist on Path1 then
it would normally be copied to Path1, but with `--dry-run` enabled those
copies don't happen, which leads to the attempted delete on Path2,
blocked again by --dry-run: `... Not deleting as --dry-run`.

This whole confusing situation is an artifact of the `--dry-run` flag.
Scrutinize the proposed deletes carefully, and if the files would have been
copied to Path1 then the threatened deletes on Path2 may be disregarded.

### Retries

Rclone has built-in retries. If you run with `--verbose` you'll see
error and retry messages such as shown below. This is usually not a bug.
If at the end of the run, you see `Bisync successful` and not
`Bisync critical error` or `Bisync aborted` then the run was successful,
and you can ignore the error messages.

The following run shows an intermittent fail. Lines _5_ and _6- are
low-level messages. Line _6_ is a bubbled-up _warning_ message, conveying
the error. Rclone normally retries failing commands, so there may be
numerous such messages in the log.

Since there are no final error/warning messages on line _7_, rclone has
recovered from failure after a retry, and the overall sync was successful.

```
1: 2021/05/14 00:44:12 INFO  : Synching Path1 "/path/to/local/tree" with Path2 "dropbox:"
2: 2021/05/14 00:44:12 INFO  : Path1 checking for diffs

```

This log shows a _Critical failure_ which requires a `--resync` to recover from.
See the [Runtime Error Handling](#error-handling) section.

```

```

### Denied downloads of "infected" or "abusive" files

Google Drive has a filter for certain file types (`.exe`, `.apk`, et cetera)
that by default cannot be copied from Google Drive to the local filesystem.
If you are having problems, run with `--verbose` to see specifically which
files are generating complaints. If the error is
`This file has been identified as malware or spam and cannot be downloaded`,
consider using the flag
[--drive-acknowledge-abuse](https://rclone.org/drive/#drive-acknowledge-abuse).

### Google Docs (and other files of unknown size) {#gdocs}

As of `v1.66`, [Google Docs](https://rclone.org/drive/#import-export-of-google-documents)
(including Google Sheets, Slides, etc.) are now supported in bisync, subject to
the same options, defaults, and limitations as in `rclone sync`. When bisyncing
drive with non-drive backends, the drive -> non-drive direction is controlled
by [`--drive-export-formats`](https://rclone.org/drive/#drive-export-formats) (default
`"docx,xlsx,pptx,svg"`) and the non-drive -> drive direction is controlled by
[`--drive-import-formats`](https://rclone.org/drive/#drive-import-formats) (default none.) 

For example, with the default export/import formats, a Google Sheet on the
drive side will be synced to an `.xlsx` file on the non-drive side. In the
reverse direction, `.xlsx` files with filenames that match an existing Google
Sheet will be synced to that Google Sheet, while `.xlsx` files that do NOT
match an existing Google Sheet will be copied to drive as normal `.xlsx` files
(without conversion to Sheets, although the Google Drive web browser UI may
still give you the option to open it as one.)

If `--drive-import-formats` is set (it's not, by default), then all of the
specified formats will be converted to Google Docs, if there is no existing
Google Doc with a matching name. Caution: such conversion can be quite lossy,
and in most cases it's probably not what you want!

To bisync Google Docs as URL shortcut links (in a manner similar to "Drive for
Desktop"), use: `--drive-export-formats url` (or
[alternatives](https://rclone.org/drive/#exportformats:~:text=available%20Google%20Documents.-,Extension,macOS,-Standard%20options).)

Note that these link files cannot be edited on the non-drive side -- you will
get errors if you try to sync an edited link file back to drive. They CAN be
deleted (it will result in deleting the corresponding Google Doc.) If you
create a `.url` file on the non-drive side that does not match an existing
Google Doc, bisyncing it will just result in copying the literal `.url` file
over to drive (no Google Doc will be created.) So, as a general rule of thumb,
think of them as read-only placeholders on the non-drive side, and make all
your changes on the drive side.

Likewise, even with other export-formats, it is best to only move/rename Google
Docs on the drive side. This is because otherwise, bisync will interpret this
as a file deleted and another created, and accordingly, it will delete the
Google Doc and create a new file at the new path. (Whether or not that new file
is a Google Doc depends on `--drive-import-formats`.)

Lastly, take note that all Google Docs on the drive side have a size of `-1`
and no checksum. Therefore, they cannot be reliably synced with the
`--checksum` or `--size-only` flags. (To be exact: they will still get
created/deleted, and bisync's delta engine will notice changes and queue them
for syncing, but the underlying sync function will consider them identical and
skip them.) To work around this, use the default (modtime and size) instead of
`--checksum` or `--size-only`.

To ignore Google Docs entirely, use
[`--drive-skip-gdocs`](https://rclone.org/drive/#drive-skip-gdocs).

## Usage examples

### Cron {#cron}

Rclone does not yet have a built-in capability to monitor the local file
system for changes and must be blindly run periodically.
On Windows this can be done using a _Task Scheduler_,
on Linux you can use _Cron_ which is described below.

The 1st example runs a sync every 5 minutes between a local directory
and an OwnCloud server, with output logged to a runlog file:

```
# Minute (0-59)
#      Hour (0-23)
#           Day of Month (1-31)
#                Month (1-12 or Jan-Dec)
#                     Day of Week (0-6 or Sun-Sat)
#                         Command
  */5  *    *    *    *   /path/to/rclone bisync /local/files MyCloud: --check-access --filters-file /path/to/bysync-filters.txt --log-file /path/to//bisync.log
```

See [crontab syntax](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/crontab.1p.html#INPUT_FILES)
for the details of crontab time interval expressions.

If you run `rclone bisync` as a cron job, redirect stdout/stderr to a file.
The 2nd example runs a sync to Dropbox every hour and logs all stdout (via the `>>`)
and stderr (via `2>&1`) to a log file.

```
0 * * * * /path/to/rclone bisync /path/to/local/dropbox Dropbox: --check-access --filters-file /home/user/filters.txt >> /path/to/logs/dropbox-run.log 2>&1
```

### Sharing an encrypted folder tree between hosts

bisync can keep a local folder in sync with a cloud service,
but what if you have some highly sensitive files to be synched?

Usage of a cloud service is for exchanging both routine and sensitive
personal files between one's home network, one's personal notebook when on the
road, and with one's work computer. The routine data is not sensitive.
For the sensitive data, configure an rclone [crypt remote](https://rclone.org/crypt/) to point to
a subdirectory within the local disk tree that is bisync'd to Dropbox,
and then set up an bisync for this local crypt directory to a directory
outside of the main sync tree.

### Linux server setup

- `/path/to/DBoxroot` is the root of my local sync tree.
  There are numerous subdirectories.
- `/path/to/DBoxroot/crypt` is the root subdirectory for files
  that are encrypted. This local directory target is setup as an
  rclone crypt remote named `Dropcrypt:`.
  See [rclone.conf](#rclone-conf-snippet) snippet below.
- `/path/to/my/unencrypted/files` is the root of my sensitive
  files - not encrypted, not within the tree synched to Dropbox.
- To sync my local unencrypted files with the encrypted Dropbox versions
  I manually run `bisync /path/to/my/unencrypted/files DropCrypt:`.
  This step could be bundled into a script to run before and after
  the full Dropbox tree sync in the last step,
  thus actively keeping the sensitive files in sync.
- `bisync /path/to/DBoxroot Dropbox:` runs periodically via cron,
  keeping my full local sync tree in sync with Dropbox.

### Windows notebook setup

- The Dropbox client runs keeping the local tree `C:\Users\MyLogin\Dropbox`
  always in sync with Dropbox. I could have used `rclone bisync` instead.
- A separate directory tree at `C:\Users\MyLogin\Documents\DropLocal`
  hosts the tree of unencrypted files/folders.
- To sync my local unencrypted files with the encrypted
  Dropbox versions I manually run the following command:
  `rclone bisync C:\Users\MyLogin\Documents\DropLocal Dropcrypt:`.
- The Dropbox client then syncs the changes with Dropbox.

## Testing {#testing}

You should read this section only if you are developing for rclone.
You need to have rclone source code locally to work with bisync tests.

Bisync has a dedicated test framework implemented in the `bisync_test.go`
file located in the rclone source tree. The test suite is based on the
`go test` command. Series of tests are stored in subdirectories below the
`cmd/bisync/testdata` directory. Individual tests can be invoked by their
directory name, e.g.
`go test . -case basic -remote local -remote2 gdrive: -v`

Tests will make a temporary folder on remote and purge it afterwards.
If during test run there are intermittent errors and rclone retries,
these errors will be captured and flagged as invalid MISCOMPAREs.
Rerunning the test will let it pass. Consider such failures as noise.

### Test command syntax

```
usage: go test ./cmd/bisync [options...]

Options:
  -case NAME        Name(s) of the test case(s) to run. Multiple names should
                    be separated by commas. You can remove the `test_` prefix
                    and replace `_` by `-` in test name for convenience.
                    If not `all`, the name(s) should map to a directory under
                    `./cmd/bisync/testdata`.
                    Use `all` to run all tests (default: all)
  -remote PATH1     `local` or name of cloud service with `:` (default: local)
  -remote2 PATH2    `local` or name of cloud service with `:` (default: local)
  -no-compare       Disable comparing test results with the golden directory
                    (default: compare)
  -no-cleanup       Disable cleanup of Path1 and Path2 testdirs.
                    Useful for troubleshooting. (default: cleanup)
  -golden           Store results in the golden directory (default: false)
                    This flag can be used with multiple tests.
  -debug            Print debug messages
  -stop-at NUM      Stop test after given step number. (default: run to the end)
                    Implies `-no-compare` and `-no-cleanup`, if the test really
                    ends prematurely. Only meaningful for a single test case.
  -refresh-times    Force refreshing the target modtime, useful for Dropbox
                    (default: false)
  -verbose          Run tests verbosely
```

Note: unlike rclone flags which must be prefixed by double dash (`--`), the
test command flags can be equally prefixed by a single `-` or double dash.

### Running tests

- `go test . -case basic -remote local -remote2 local`
  runs the `test_basic` test case using only the local filesystem,
  synching one local directory with another local directory.
  Test script output is to the console, while commands within scenario.txt
  have their output sent to the `.../workdir/test.log` file,
  which is finally compared to the golden copy.
- The first argument after `go test` should be a relative name of the
  directory containing bisync source code. If you run tests right from there,
  the argument will be `.` (current directory) as in most examples below.
  If you run bisync tests from the rclone source directory, the command
  should be `go test ./cmd/bisync ...`.
- The test engine will mangle rclone output to ensure comparability
  with golden listings and logs.
- Test scenarios are located in `./cmd/bisync/testdata`. The test `-case`
  argument should match the full name of a subdirectory under that
  directory. Every test subdirectory name on disk must start with `test_`,
  this prefix can be omitted on command line for brevity. Also, underscores
  in the name can be replaced by dashes for convenience.
- `go test . -remote local -remote2 local -case all` runs all tests.
- Path1 and Path2 may either be the keyword `local`
  or may be names of configured cloud services.
  `go test . -remote gdrive: -remote2 dropbox: -case basic`
  will run the test between these two services, without transferring
  any files to the local filesystem.
- Test run stdout and stderr console output may be directed to a file, e.g.
  `go test . -remote gdrive: -remote2 local -case all > runlog.txt 2>&1`

### Test execution flow

1. The base setup in the `initial` directory of the testcase is applied
   on the Path1 and Path2 filesystems (via rclone copy the initial directory
   to Path1, then rclone sync Path1 to Path2).
2. The commands in the scenario.txt file are applied, with output directed
   to the `test.log` file in the test working directory.
   Typically, the first actual command in the `scenario.txt` file is
   to do a `--resync`, which establishes the baseline
   `{...}.path1.lst` and `{...}.path2.lst` files in the test working
   directory (`.../workdir/` relative to the temporary test directory).
   Various commands and listing snapshots are done within the test.
3. Finally, the contents of the test working directory are compared
   to the contents of the testcase's golden directory.

### Notes about testing

- Test cases are in individual directories beneath `./cmd/bisync/testdata`.
  A command line reference to a test is understood to reference a directory
  beneath `testdata`. For example,
  `go test ./cmd/bisync -case dry-run -remote gdrive: -remote2 local`
  refers to the test case in `./cmd/bisync/testdata/test_dry_run`.
- The test working directory is located at `.../workdir` relative to a
  temporary test directory, usually under `/tmp` on Linux.
- The local test sync tree is created at a temporary directory named
  like `bisync.XXX` under system temporary directory.
- The remote test sync tree is located at a temporary directory
  under `<remote:>/bisync.XXX/`.
- `path1` and/or `path2` subdirectories are created in a temporary
  directory under the respective local or cloud test remote.
- By default, the Path1 and Path2 test dirs and workdir will be deleted
  after each test run. The `-no-cleanup` flag disables purging these
  directories when validating and debugging a given test.
  These directories will be flushed before running another test,
  independent of the `-no-cleanup` usage.
- You will likely want to add `- /testdir/` to your normal
  bisync `--filters-file` so that normal syncs do not attempt to sync
  the test temporary directories, which may have `RCLONE_TEST` miscompares
  in some testcases which would otherwise trip the `--check-access` system.
  The `--check-access` mechanism is hard-coded to ignore `RCLONE_TEST`
  files beneath `bisync/testdata`, so the test cases may reside on the
  synched tree even if there are check file mismatches in the test tree.
- Some Dropbox tests can fail, notably printing the following message:
  `src and dst identical but can't set mod time without deleting and re-uploading`
  This is expected and happens due to the way Dropbox handles modification times.
  You should use the `-refresh-times` test flag to make up for this.
- If Dropbox tests hit request limit for you and print error message
  `too_many_requests/...: Too many requests or write operations.`
  then follow the
  [Dropbox App ID instructions](https://rclone.org/dropbox/#get-your-own-dropbox-app-id).

### Updating golden results

Sometimes even a slight change in the bisync source can cause little changes
spread around many log files. Updating them manually would be a nightmare.

The `-golden` flag will store the `test.log` and `*.lst` listings from each
test case into respective golden directories. Golden results will
automatically contain generic strings instead of local or cloud paths which
means that they should match when run with a different cloud service.

Your normal workflow might be as follows:
1. Git-clone the rclone sources locally
2. Modify bisync source and check that it builds
3. Run the whole test suite `go test ./cmd/bisync -remote local`
4. If some tests show log difference, recheck them individually, e.g.:
   `go test ./cmd/bisync -remote local -case basic`
5. If you are convinced with the difference, goldenize all tests at once:
   `go test ./cmd/bisync -remote local -golden`
6. Use word diff: `git diff --word-diff ./cmd/bisync/testdata/`.
   Please note that normal line-level diff is generally useless here.
7. Check the difference _carefully_!
8. Commit the change (`git commit`) _only_ if you are sure.
   If unsure, save your code changes then wipe the log diffs from git:
   `git reset [--hard]`.

### Structure of test scenarios

- `<testname>/initial/` contains a tree of files that will be set
  as the initial condition on both Path1 and Path2 testdirs.
- `<testname>/modfiles/` contains files that will be used to
  modify the Path1 and/or Path2 filesystems.
- `<testname>/golden/` contains the expected content of the test
  working directory (`workdir`) at the completion of the testcase.
- `<testname>/scenario.txt` contains the body of the test, in the form of
  various commands to modify files, run bisync, and snapshot listings.
  Output from these commands is captured to `.../workdir/test.log`
  for comparison to the golden files.

### Supported test commands

- `test <some message>`
  Print the line to the console and to the `test.log`:
  `test sync is working correctly with options x, y, z`
- `copy-listings <prefix>`
  Save a copy of all `.lst` listings in the test working directory
  with the specified prefix:
  `save-listings exclude-pass-run`
- `move-listings <prefix>`
  Similar to `copy-listings` but removes the source
- `purge-children <dir>`
  This will delete all child files and purge all child subdirs under given
  directory but keep the parent intact. This behavior is important for tests
  with Google Drive because removing and re-creating the parent would change
  its ID.
- `delete-file <file>`
  Delete a single file.
- `delete-glob <dir> <pattern>`
  Delete a group of files located one level deep in the given directory
  with names matching a given glob pattern.
- `touch-glob YYYY-MM-DD <dir> <pattern>`
  Change modification time on a group of files.
- `touch-copy YYYY-MM-DD <source-file> <dest-dir>`
  Change file modification time then copy it to destination.
- `copy-file <source-file> <dest-dir>`
  Copy a single file to given directory.
- `copy-as <source-file> <dest-file>`
  Similar to above but destination must include both directory
  and the new file name at destination.
- `copy-dir <src> <dst>` and `sync-dir <src> <dst>`
  Copy/sync a directory. Equivalent of `rclone copy` and `rclone sync`.
- `list-dirs <dir>`
  Equivalent to `rclone lsf -R --dirs-only <dir>`
- `bisync [options]`
  Runs bisync against `-remote` and `-remote2`.

### Supported substitution terms

- `{testdir/}` - the root dir of the testcase
- `{datadir/}` - the `modfiles` dir under the testcase root
- `{workdir/}` - the temporary test working directory
- `{path1/}` - the root of the Path1 test directory tree
- `{path2/}` - the root of the Path2 test directory tree
- `{session}` - base name of the test listings
- `{/}` - OS-specific path separator
- `{spc}`, `{tab}`, `{eol}` - whitespace
- `{chr:HH}` - raw byte with given hexadecimal code

Substitution results of the terms named like `{dir/}` will end with
`/` (or backslash on Windows), so it is not necessary to include
slash in the usage, for example `delete-file {path1/}file1.txt`.

## Benchmarks

_This section is work in progress._

Here are a few data points for scale, execution times, and memory usage.

The first set of data was taken between a local disk to Dropbox.
The [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net) download speed was ~170 Mbps,
and upload speed was ~10 Mbps. 500 files (~9.5 MB each) had been already
synched. 50 files were added in a new directory, each ~9.5 MB, ~475 MB total.

Change                                | Operations and times                                   | Overall run time
--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------
500 files synched (nothing to move)   | 1x listings for Path1 & Path2                          | 1.5 sec
500 files synched with --check-access | 1x listings for Path1 & Path2                          | 1.5 sec
50 new files on remote                | Queued 50 copies down: 27 sec                          |  29 sec
Moved local dir                       | Queued 50 copies up: 410 sec, 50 deletes up: 9 sec     | 421 sec
Moved remote dir                      | Queued 50 copies down: 31 sec, 50 deletes down: <1 sec |  33 sec
Delete local dir                      | Queued 50 deletes up: 9 sec                            |  13 sec

This next data is from a user's application. They had ~400GB of data
over 1.96 million files being sync'ed between a Windows local disk and some
remote cloud. The file full path length was on average 35 characters
(which factors into load time and RAM required).

- Loading the prior listing into memory (1.96 million files, listing file
  size 140 MB) took ~30 sec and occupied about 1 GB of RAM.
- Getting a fresh listing of the local file system (producing the
  140 MB output file) took about XXX sec.
- Getting a fresh listing of the remote file system (producing the 140 MB
  output file) took about XXX sec. The network download speed was measured
  at XXX Mb/s.
- Once the prior and current Path1 and Path2 listings were loaded (a total
  of four to be loaded, two at a time), determining the deltas was pretty
  quick (a few seconds for this test case), and the transfer time for any
  files to be copied was dominated by the network bandwidth.

## References

rclone's bisync implementation was derived from
the [rclonesync-V2](https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2) project,
including documentation and test mechanisms,
with [@cjnaz](https://github.com/cjnaz)'s full support and encouragement.

`rclone bisync` is similar in nature to a range of other projects:

- [unison](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison)
- [syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing)
- [cjnaz/rclonesync](https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2)
- [ConorWilliams/rsinc](https://github.com/ConorWilliams/rsinc)
- [jwink3101/syncrclone](https://github.com/Jwink3101/syncrclone)
- [DavideRossi/upback](https://github.com/DavideRossi/upback)

Bisync adopts the differential synchronization technique, which is
based on keeping history of changes performed by both synchronizing sides.
See the _Dual Shadow Method_ section in
[Neil Fraser's article](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/sync/).

Also note a number of academic publications by
[Benjamin Pierce](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7Ebcpierce/papers/index.shtml#File%20Synchronization)
about _Unison_ and synchronization in general.

## Changelog

### `v1.68`
* Fixed an issue affecting backends that round modtimes to a lower precision.

### `v1.67`
* Added integration tests against all backends.

### `v1.66`
* Copies and deletes are now handled in one operation instead of two
* `--track-renames` and `--backup-dir` are now supported
* Partial uploads known issue on `local`/`ftp`/`sftp` has been resolved (unless using `--inplace`)
* Final listings are now generated from sync results, to avoid needing to re-list
* Bisync is now much more resilient to changes that happen during a bisync run, and far less prone to critical errors / undetected changes
* Bisync is now capable of rolling a file listing back in cases of uncertainty, essentially marking the file as needing to be rechecked next time.
* A few basic terminal colors are now supported, controllable with [`--color`](https://rclone.org/docs/#color-when) (`AUTO`|`NEVER`|`ALWAYS`)
* Initial listing snapshots of Path1 and Path2 are now generated concurrently, using the same "march" infrastructure as `check` and `sync`,
for performance improvements and less [risk of error](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=4.%20Listings%20should%20alternate%20between%20paths%20to%20minimize%20errors).
* Fixed handling of unicode normalization and case insensitivity, support for [`--fix-case`](https://rclone.org/docs/#fix-case), [`--ignore-case-sync`](/docs/#ignore-case-sync), [`--no-unicode-normalization`](/docs/#no-unicode-normalization)
* `--resync` is now much more efficient (especially for users of `--create-empty-src-dirs`)
* Google Docs (and other files of unknown size) are now supported (with the same options as in `sync`)
* Equality checks before a sync conflict rename now fall back to `cryptcheck` (when possible) or `--download`,
instead of of `--size-only`, when `check` is not available.
* Bisync no longer fails to find the correct listing file when configs are overridden with backend-specific flags.
* Bisync now fully supports comparing based on any combination of size, modtime, and checksum, lifting the prior restriction on backends without modtime support.
* Bisync now supports a "Graceful Shutdown" mode to cleanly cancel a run early without requiring `--resync`.
* New `--recover` flag allows robust recovery in the event of interruptions, without requiring `--resync`.
* A new `--max-lock` setting allows lock files to automatically renew and expire, for better automatic recovery when a run is interrupted.
* Bisync now supports auto-resolving sync conflicts and customizing rename behavior with new [`--conflict-resolve`](#conflict-resolve), [`--conflict-loser`](#conflict-loser), and [`--conflict-suffix`](#conflict-suffix) flags.
* A new [`--resync-mode`](#resync-mode) flag allows more control over which version of a file gets kept during a `--resync`.
* Bisync now supports [`--retries`](https://rclone.org/docs/#retries-int) and [`--retries-sleep`](/docs/#retries-sleep-time) (when [`--resilient`](#resilient) is set.)

### `v1.64`
* Fixed an [issue](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=1.%20Dry%20runs%20are%20not%20completely%20dry)

causing `--resync` to erroneously delete empty folders and duplicate files unique to Path2
* `--check-access` is now enforced during `--resync`, preventing data loss in [certain user error scenarios](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=%2D%2Dcheck%2Daccess%20doesn%27t%20always%20fail%20when%20it%20should)

causing bisync to consider more files than necessary due to overbroad filters during delete operations
* [Improved detection of false positive change conflicts](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=1.%20Identical%20files%20should%20be%20left%20alone%2C%20even%20if%20new/newer/changed%20on%20both%20sides)

# Release signing

The hashes of the binary artefacts of the rclone release are signed
with a public PGP/GPG key. This can be verified manually as described
below.

The same mechanism is also used by [rclone selfupdate](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/)
to verify that the release has not been tampered with before the new
update is installed. This checks the SHA256 hash and the signature
with a public key compiled into the rclone binary.

## Release signing key

You may obtain the release signing key from:

- From [KEYS](/KEYS) on this website - this file contains all past signing keys also.
- The git repository hosted on GitHub - https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/docs/content/KEYS
- `gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --search nick@craig-wood.com`
- `gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com --search nick@craig-wood.com`
- https://www.craig-wood.com/nick/pub/pgp-key.txt

After importing the key, verify that the fingerprint of one of the
keys matches: `FBF737ECE9F8AB18604BD2AC93935E02FF3B54FA` as this key is used for signing.

We recommend that you cross-check the fingerprint shown above through
the domains listed below. By cross-checking the integrity of the
fingerprint across multiple domains you can be confident that you
obtained the correct key.

- The [source for this page on GitHub](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/docs/content/release_signing.md).
- Through DNS `dig key.rclone.org txt`

If you find anything that doesn't not match, please contact the
developers at once.

## How to verify the release

In the release directory you will see the release files and some files called `MD5SUMS`, `SHA1SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS`.

```
$ rclone lsf --http-url https://downloads.rclone.org/v1.63.1 :http:
MD5SUMS
SHA1SUMS
SHA256SUMS
rclone-v1.63.1-freebsd-386.zip
rclone-v1.63.1-freebsd-amd64.zip
...
rclone-v1.63.1-windows-arm64.zip
rclone-v1.63.1.tar.gz
version.txt
```

The `MD5SUMS`, `SHA1SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS` contain hashes of the
binary files in the release directory along with a signature.

For example:

```
$ rclone cat --http-url https://downloads.rclone.org/v1.63.1 :http:SHA256SUMS
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

f6d1b2d7477475ce681bdce8cb56f7870f174cb6b2a9ac5d7b3764296ea4a113  rclone-v1.63.1-freebsd-386.zip

```

### Download the files

The first step is to download the binary and SUMs file and verify that
the SUMs you have downloaded match. Here we download
`rclone-v1.63.1-windows-amd64.zip` - choose the binary (or binaries)
appropriate to your architecture. We've also chosen the `SHA256SUMS`
as these are the most secure. You could verify the other types of hash
also for extra security. `rclone selfupdate` verifies just the
`SHA256SUMS`.

```
$ mkdir /tmp/check
$ cd /tmp/check
$ rclone copy --http-url https://downloads.rclone.org/v1.63.1 :http:SHA256SUMS .
$ rclone copy --http-url https://downloads.rclone.org/v1.63.1 :http:rclone-v1.63.1-windows-amd64.zip .
```

### Verify the signatures

First verify the signatures on the SHA256 file.

Import the key. See above for ways to verify this key is correct.

```
$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --receive-keys FBF737ECE9F8AB18604BD2AC93935E02FF3B54FA
gpg: key 93935E02FF3B54FA: public key "Nick Craig-Wood <nick@craig-wood.com>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
```

Then check the signature:

```
$ gpg --verify SHA256SUMS 
gpg: Signature made Mon 17 Jul 2023 15:03:17 BST
gpg:                using DSA key FBF737ECE9F8AB18604BD2AC93935E02FF3B54FA
gpg: Good signature from "Nick Craig-Wood <nick@craig-wood.com>" [ultimate]
```

Verify the signature was good and is using the fingerprint shown above.

Repeat for `MD5SUMS` and `SHA1SUMS` if desired.

### Verify the hashes

Now that we know the signatures on the hashes are OK we can verify the
binaries match the hashes, completing the verification.

```
$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS 2>&1 | grep OK
rclone-v1.63.1-windows-amd64.zip: OK
```

#  1Fichier

This is a backend for the [1fichier](https://1fichier.com) cloud
storage service. Note that a Premium subscription is required to use
the API.

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for 1Fichier involves getting the API key from the website which you
need to do in your browser.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value

Options:
- type: fichier
- api_key: example_key
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your 1Fichier account

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your 1Fichier account

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a 1Fichier directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modification times and hashes

1Fichier does not support modification times. It supports the Whirlpool hash algorithm.

### Duplicated files

1Fichier can have two files with exactly the same name and path (unlike a
normal file system).

Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜           |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞           |
| "         | 0x22  | ＂           |
| $         | 0x24  | ＄           |
| `         | 0x60  | ｀           |
| '         | 0x27  | ＇           |

File names can also not start or end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the first or last character in the
name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the 1Fichier backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) and [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Alias

The `alias` remote provides a new name for another remote.

Paths may be as deep as required or a local path, 
e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory` or `/directory/subdirectory`.

During the initial setup with `rclone config` you will specify the target
remote. The target remote can either be a local path or another remote.

Subfolders can be used in target remote. Assume an alias remote named `backup`
with the target `mydrive:private/backup`. Invoking `rclone mkdir backup:desktop`
is exactly the same as invoking `rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/desktop`.

There will be no special handling of paths containing `..` segments.
Invoking `rclone mkdir backup:../desktop` is exactly the same as invoking
`rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/../desktop`.
The empty path is not allowed as a remote. To alias the current directory
use `.` instead.

The target remote can also be a [connection string](https://rclone.org/docs/#connection-strings). 
This can be used to modify the config of a remote for different uses, e.g.
the alias  `myDriveTrash` with the target remote `myDrive,trashed_only:` 
can be used to only show the trashed files in `myDrive`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make an alias called `remote` for local folder.
First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Alias for an existing remote
   \ "alias"
[snip]
Storage> alias
Remote or path to alias.
Can be "myremote:path/to/dir", "myremote:bucket", "myremote:" or "/local/path".
remote> /mnt/storage/backup
Remote config
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: alias
- remote: /mnt/storage/backup
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
remote               alias

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level in `/mnt/storage/backup`

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in `/mnt/storage/backup`

    rclone ls remote:

Copy another local directory to the alias directory called source

    rclone copy /home/source remote:source


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to alias (Alias for an existing remote).

#### --alias-remote

Can be "myremote:path/to/dir", "myremote:bucket", "myremote:" or "/local/path".

Properties:

- Config:      remote
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ALIAS_REMOTE
- Type:        string
- Required:    true

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to alias (Alias for an existing remote).

#### --alias-description

#  Amazon S3 Storage Providers

The S3 backend can be used with a number of different providers:


- AWS S3
- Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) Object Storage System (OSS)
- Ceph
- China Mobile Ecloud Elastic Object Storage (EOS)
- Cloudflare R2
- Arvan Cloud Object Storage (AOS)
- DigitalOcean Spaces
- Dreamhost
- GCS
- Huawei OBS
- IBM COS S3
- IDrive e2
- IONOS Cloud
- Leviia Object Storage

### Modification times and hashes

#### Modification times

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
`X-Amz-Meta-Mtime` as floating point since the epoch, accurate to 1 ns.

If the modification time needs to be updated rclone will attempt to perform a server
side copy to update the modification if the object can be copied in a single part.
In the case the object is larger than 5Gb or is in Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive
storage the object will be uploaded rather than copied.

Note that reading this from the object takes an additional `HEAD`
request as the metadata isn't returned in object listings.

#### Hashes

For small objects which weren't uploaded as multipart uploads (objects
sized below `--s3-upload-cutoff` if uploaded with rclone) rclone uses
the `ETag:` header as an MD5 checksum.

However for objects which were uploaded as multipart uploads or with
server side encryption (SSE-AWS or SSE-C) the `ETag` header is no
longer the MD5 sum of the data, so rclone adds an additional piece of
metadata `X-Amz-Meta-Md5chksum` which is a base64 encoded MD5 hash (in
the same format as is required for `Content-MD5`).  You can use base64 -d and hexdump to check this value manually:

    echo 'VWTGdNx3LyXQDfA0e2Edxw==' | base64 -d | hexdump

or you can use `rclone check` to verify the hashes are OK.

For large objects, calculating this hash can take some time so the
addition of this hash can be disabled with `--s3-disable-checksum`.
This will mean that these objects do not have an MD5 checksum.

Note that reading this from the object takes an additional `HEAD`
request as the metadata isn't returned in object listings.

### Reducing costs

#### Avoiding HEAD requests to read the modification time

By default, rclone will use the modification time of objects stored in
S3 for syncing.  This is stored in object metadata which unfortunately
takes an extra HEAD request to read which can be expensive (in time
and money).

The modification time is used by default for all operations that
require checking the time a file was last updated. It allows rclone to
treat the remote more like a true filesystem, but it is inefficient on
S3 because it requires an extra API call to retrieve the metadata.

The extra API calls can be avoided when syncing (using `rclone sync`
or `rclone copy`) in a few different ways, each with its own
tradeoffs.

- `--size-only`
    - Only checks the size of files.
    - Uses no extra transactions.
    - If the file doesn't change size then rclone won't detect it has
      changed.
    - `rclone sync --size-only /path/to/source s3:bucket`
- `--checksum`
    - Checks the size and MD5 checksum of files.
    - Uses no extra transactions.
    - The most accurate detection of changes possible.
    - Will cause the source to read an MD5 checksum which, if it is a
      local disk, will cause lots of disk activity.
    - If the source and destination are both S3 this is the
      **recommended** flag to use for maximum efficiency.
    - `rclone sync --checksum /path/to/source s3:bucket`
- `--update --use-server-modtime`
    - Uses no extra transactions.
    - Modification time becomes the time the object was uploaded.
    - For many operations this is sufficient to determine if it needs
      uploading.
    - Using `--update` along with `--use-server-modtime`, avoids the
      extra API call and uploads files whose local modification time
      is newer than the time it was last uploaded.
    - Files created with timestamps in the past will be missed by the sync.
    - `rclone sync --update --use-server-modtime /path/to/source s3:bucket`

These flags can and should be used in combination with `--fast-list` -
see below.

If using `rclone mount` or any command using the VFS (eg `rclone
serve`) commands then you might want to consider using the VFS flag
`--no-modtime` which will stop rclone reading the modification time
for every object. You could also use `--use-server-modtime` if you are
happy with the modification times of the objects being the time of
upload.

#### Avoiding GET requests to read directory listings

Rclone's default directory traversal is to process each directory
individually.  This takes one API call per directory.  Using the
`--fast-list` flag will read all info about the objects into
memory first using a smaller number of API calls (one per 1000
objects). See the [rclone docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

    rclone sync --fast-list --checksum /path/to/source s3:bucket

`--fast-list` trades off API transactions for memory use. As a rough
guide rclone uses 1k of memory per object stored, so using
`--fast-list` on a sync of a million objects will use roughly 1 GiB of
RAM.

If you are only copying a small number of files into a big repository
then using `--no-traverse` is a good idea. This finds objects directly
instead of through directory listings. You can do a "top-up" sync very
cheaply by using `--max-age` and `--no-traverse` to copy only recent
files, eg

    rclone copy --max-age 24h --no-traverse /path/to/source s3:bucket

You'd then do a full `rclone sync` less often.

Note that `--fast-list` isn't required in the top-up sync.

#### Avoiding HEAD requests after PUT

By default, rclone will HEAD every object it uploads. It does this to
check the object got uploaded correctly.

You can disable this with the [--s3-no-head](#s3-no-head) option - see
there for more details.

Setting this flag increases the chance for undetected upload failures.

### Versions

When bucket versioning is enabled (this can be done with rclone with
the [`rclone backend versioning`](#versioning) command) when rclone
uploads a new version of a file it creates a
[new version of it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html)
Likewise when you delete a file, the old version will be marked hidden
and still be available.

Old versions of files, where available, are visible using the
[`--s3-versions`](#s3-versions) flag.

It is also possible to view a bucket as it was at a certain point in
time, using the [`--s3-version-at`](#s3-version-at) flag. This will
show the file versions as they were at that time, showing files that
have been deleted afterwards, and hiding files that were created
since.

If you wish to remove all the old versions then you can use the
[`rclone backend cleanup-hidden remote:bucket`](#cleanup-hidden)
command which will delete all the old hidden versions of files,
leaving the current ones intact. You can also supply a path and only
old versions under that path will be deleted, e.g.
`rclone backend cleanup-hidden remote:bucket/path/to/stuff`.

When you `purge` a bucket, the current and the old versions will be
deleted then the bucket will be deleted.

However `delete` will cause the current versions of the files to
become hidden old versions.

Here is a session showing the listing and retrieval of an old
version followed by a `cleanup` of the old versions.

Show current version and all the versions with `--s3-versions` flag.

```
$ rclone -q ls s3:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt

$ rclone -q ls s3:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt

$ rclone -q --s3-versions ls s3:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt
```

#### Versions naming caveat

When using `--s3-versions` flag rclone is relying on the file name
to work out whether the objects are versions or not. Versions' names
are created by inserting timestamp between file name and its extension.
```
        9 file.txt
        8 file-v2023-07-17-161032-000.txt
       16 file-v2023-06-15-141003-000.txt
```
If there are real files present with the same names as versions, then
behaviour of `--s3-versions` can be unpredictable.

### Cleanup

If you run `rclone cleanup s3:bucket` then it will remove all pending
multipart uploads older than 24 hours. You can use the `--interactive`/`i`
or `--dry-run` flag to see exactly what it will do. If you want more control over the
expiry date then run `rclone backend cleanup s3:bucket -o max-age=1h`
to expire all uploads older than one hour. You can use `rclone backend
list-multipart-uploads s3:bucket` to see the pending multipart
uploads.

### Restricted filename characters

S3 allows any valid UTF-8 string as a key.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as
they can't be used in XML.

The following characters are replaced since these are problematic when
dealing with the REST API:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／           |

The encoding will also encode these file names as they don't seem to
work with the SDK properly:

| File name | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----------:|
| .         | ．          |
| ..        | ．．         |

### Multipart uploads

rclone supports multipart uploads with S3 which means that it can
upload files bigger than 5 GiB.

Note that files uploaded *both* with multipart upload *and* through
crypt remotes do not have MD5 sums.

rclone switches from single part uploads to multipart uploads at the
point specified by `--s3-upload-cutoff`.  This can be a maximum of 5 GiB
and a minimum of 0 (ie always upload multipart files).

The chunk sizes used in the multipart upload are specified by
`--s3-chunk-size` and the number of chunks uploaded concurrently is
specified by `--s3-upload-concurrency`.

Multipart uploads will use `--transfers` * `--s3-upload-concurrency` *
`--s3-chunk-size` extra memory.  Single part uploads to not use extra
memory.

Single part transfers can be faster than multipart transfers or slower
depending on your latency from S3 - the more latency, the more likely
single part transfers will be faster.

Increasing `--s3-upload-concurrency` will increase throughput (8 would
be a sensible value) and increasing `--s3-chunk-size` also increases
throughput (16M would be sensible).  Increasing either of these will
use more memory.  The default values are high enough to gain most of
the possible performance without using too much memory.


### Buckets and Regions

With Amazon S3 you can list buckets (`rclone lsd`) using any region,
but you can only access the content of a bucket from the region it was
created in.  If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong region,
you will get an error, `incorrect region, the bucket is not in 'XXX'
region`.

### Authentication

There are a number of ways to supply `rclone` with a set of AWS
credentials, with and without using the environment.

The different authentication methods are tried in this order:

 - Directly in the rclone configuration file (`env_auth = false` in the config file):
   - `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` are required.
   - `session_token` can be optionally set when using AWS STS.
 - Runtime configuration (`env_auth = true` in the config file):
   - Export the following environment variables before running `rclone`:
     - Access Key ID: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`
     - Secret Access Key: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_SECRET_KEY`
     - Session Token: `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional)
   - Or, use a [named profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html):
     - Profile files are standard files used by AWS CLI tools
     - By default it will use the profile in your home directory (e.g. `~/.aws/credentials` on unix based systems) file and the "default" profile, to change set these environment variables or config keys:
         - `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` to control which file or the `shared_credentials_file` config key.
         - `AWS_PROFILE` to control which profile to use or the `profile` config key.
   - Or, run `rclone` in an ECS task with an IAM role (AWS only).
   - Or, run `rclone` on an EC2 instance with an IAM role (AWS only).
   - Or, run `rclone` in an EKS pod with an IAM role that is associated with a service account (AWS only).
   - Or, use [process credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-process-credentials.html) to read config from an external program.

With `env_auth = true` rclone (which uses the SDK for Go v2) should support
[all authentication methods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/standardized-credentials.html)
that the `aws` CLI tool does and the other AWS SDKs.

If none of these option actually end up providing `rclone` with AWS
credentials then S3 interaction will be non-authenticated (see the
[anonymous access](#anonymous-access) section for more info).

### S3 Permissions

When using the `sync` subcommand of `rclone` the following minimum
permissions are required to be available on the bucket being written to:

* `ListBucket`
* `DeleteObject`
* `GetObject`
* `PutObject`
* `PutObjectACL`
* `CreateBucket` (unless using [s3-no-check-bucket](#s3-no-check-bucket))

When using the `lsd` subcommand, the `ListAllMyBuckets` permission is required.

Example policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::USER_SID:user/USER_NAME"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*",
              "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Notes on above:

1. This is a policy that can be used when creating bucket. It assumes
   that `USER_NAME` has been created.
2. The Resource entry must include both resource ARNs, as one implies
   the bucket and the other implies the bucket's objects.
3. When using [s3-no-check-bucket](#s3-no-check-bucket) and the bucket already exsits, the `"arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME"` doesn't have to be included.

For reference, [here's an Ansible script](https://gist.github.com/ebridges/ebfc9042dd7c756cd101cfa807b7ae2b)
that will generate one or more buckets that will work with `rclone sync`.

### Key Management System (KMS)

If you are using server-side encryption with KMS then you must make
sure rclone is configured with `server_side_encryption = aws:kms`
otherwise you will find you can't transfer small objects - these will
create checksum errors.

### Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive

You can upload objects using the glacier storage class or transition them to glacier using a [lifecycle policy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-lifecycle.html).
The bucket can still be synced or copied into normally, but if rclone
tries to access data from the glacier storage class you will see an error like below.

    2017/09/11 19:07:43 Failed to sync: failed to open source object: Object in GLACIER, restore first: path/to/file

In this case you need to [restore](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/restore-archived-objects.html)
the object(s) in question before using rclone.

Note that rclone only speaks the S3 API it does not speak the Glacier
Vault API, so rclone cannot directly access Glacier Vaults.

### Object-lock enabled S3 bucket

According to AWS's [documentation on S3 Object Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-overview.html#object-lock-permission):

> If you configure a default retention period on a bucket, requests to upload objects in such a bucket must include the Content-MD5 header.

As mentioned in the [Modification times and hashes](#modification-times-and-hashes) section,
small files that are not uploaded as multipart, use a different tag, causing the upload to fail.
A simple solution is to set the `--s3-upload-cutoff 0` and force all the files to be uploaded as multipart.

#### --s3-acl

Canned ACL used when creating buckets and storing or copying objects.

This ACL is used for creating objects and if bucket_acl isn't set, for creating buckets too.

For more info visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl

Note that this ACL is applied when server-side copying objects as S3
doesn't copy the ACL from the source but rather writes a fresh one.

If the acl is an empty string then no X-Amz-Acl: header is added and
the default (private) will be used.


Properties:

- Config:      acl
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_ACL
- Provider:    !Storj,Synology,Cloudflare
- Type:        string
- Required:    false
- Examples:
    - "default"
        - Owner gets Full_CONTROL.
        - No one else has access rights (default).
    - "private"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
        - No one else has access rights (default).
    - "public-read"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
        - The AllUsers group gets READ access.
    - "public-read-write"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
        - The AllUsers group gets READ and WRITE access.
        - Granting this on a bucket is generally not recommended.
    - "authenticated-read"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
        - The AuthenticatedUsers group gets READ access.
    - "bucket-owner-read"
        - Object owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
        - Bucket owner gets READ access.
        - If you specify this canned ACL when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.
    - "bucket-owner-full-control"
        - Both the object owner and the bucket owner get FULL_CONTROL over the object.
        - If you specify this canned ACL when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.
    - "private"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
        - No one else has access rights (default).
        - This acl is available on IBM Cloud (Infra), IBM Cloud (Storage), On-Premise COS.
    - "public-read"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
        - The AllUsers group gets READ access.
        - This acl is available on IBM Cloud (Infra), IBM Cloud (Storage), On-Premise IBM COS.
    - "public-read-write"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
        - The AllUsers group gets READ and WRITE access.
        - This acl is available on IBM Cloud (Infra), On-Premise IBM COS.
    - "authenticated-read"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
        - The AuthenticatedUsers group gets READ access.
        - Not supported on Buckets.

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to s3 (Amazon S3 Compliant Storage Providers including AWS, Alibaba, ArvanCloud, Ceph, ChinaMobile, Cloudflare, DigitalOcean, Dreamhost, GCS, HuaweiOBS, IBMCOS, IDrive, IONOS, LyveCloud, Leviia, Liara, Linode, Magalu, Minio, Netease, Petabox, RackCorp, Rclone, Scaleway, SeaweedFS, StackPath, Storj, Synology, TencentCOS, Wasabi, Qiniu and others).

#### --s3-bucket-acl

Canned ACL used when creating buckets.

For more info visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl

Note that this ACL is applied when only when creating buckets.  If it
isn't set then "acl" is used instead.

If the "acl" and "bucket_acl" are empty strings then no X-Amz-Acl:
header is added and the default (private) will be used.


Properties:

- Config:      bucket_acl
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_BUCKET_ACL
- Type:        string
- Required:    false
- Examples:
    - "private"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
        - No one else has access rights (default).
    - "public-read"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
        - The AllUsers group gets READ access.
    - "public-read-write"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
        - The AllUsers group gets READ and WRITE access.
        - Granting this on a bucket is generally not recommended.
    - "authenticated-read"
        - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL.
        - The AuthenticatedUsers group gets READ access.

#### --s3-requester-pays

Enables requester pays option when interacting with S3 bucket.

Properties:

- Config:      requester_pays
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_REQUESTER_PAYS
- Provider:    AWS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-sse-customer-algorithm

If using SSE-C, the server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in S3.

Properties:

- Config:      sse_customer_algorithm
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SSE_CUSTOMER_ALGORITHM
- Provider:    AWS,Ceph,ChinaMobile,Minio
- Type:        string
- Required:    false
- Examples:
    - ""
        - None
    - "AES256"
        - AES256

#### --s3-sse-customer-key

To use SSE-C you may provide the secret encryption key used to encrypt/decrypt your data.

Alternatively you can provide --sse-customer-key-base64.

Properties:

- Config:      sse_customer_key
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SSE_CUSTOMER_KEY
- Provider:    AWS,Ceph,ChinaMobile,Minio
- Type:        string
- Required:    false
- Examples:
    - ""
        - None

#### --s3-sse-customer-key-base64

If using SSE-C you must provide the secret encryption key encoded in base64 format to encrypt/decrypt your data.

Alternatively you can provide --sse-customer-key.

Properties:

- Config:      sse_customer_key_base64
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SSE_CUSTOMER_KEY_BASE64
- Provider:    AWS,Ceph,ChinaMobile,Minio
- Type:        string
- Required:    false
- Examples:
    - ""
        - None

#### --s3-sse-customer-key-md5

If using SSE-C you may provide the secret encryption key MD5 checksum (optional).

If you leave it blank, this is calculated automatically from the sse_customer_key provided.


Properties:

- Config:      sse_customer_key_md5
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SSE_CUSTOMER_KEY_MD5
- Provider:    AWS,Ceph,ChinaMobile,Minio
- Type:        string
- Required:    false
- Examples:
    - ""
        - None

#### --s3-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload.

Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of chunk_size.
The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     200Mi

#### --s3-chunk-size

Chunk size to use for uploading.

When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff or files with unknown
size (e.g. from "rclone rcat" or uploaded with "rclone mount" or google
photos or google docs) they will be uploaded as multipart uploads
using this chunk size.

Note that "--s3-upload-concurrency" chunks of this size are buffered
in memory per transfer.

If you are transferring large files over high-speed links and you have
enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.

Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a
large file of known size to stay below the 10,000 chunks limit.

Files of unknown size are uploaded with the configured
chunk_size. Since the default chunk size is 5 MiB and there can be at
most 10,000 chunks, this means that by default the maximum size of
a file you can stream upload is 48 GiB.  If you wish to stream upload
larger files then you will need to increase chunk_size.

Increasing the chunk size decreases the accuracy of the progress
statistics displayed with "-P" flag. Rclone treats chunk as sent when
it's buffered by the AWS SDK, when in fact it may still be uploading.
A bigger chunk size means a bigger AWS SDK buffer and progress
reporting more deviating from the truth.


Properties:

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     5Mi

#### --s3-max-upload-parts

Maximum number of parts in a multipart upload.

This option defines the maximum number of multipart chunks to use
when doing a multipart upload.

This can be useful if a service does not support the AWS S3
specification of 10,000 chunks.

Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a
large file of a known size to stay below this number of chunks limit.


Properties:

- Config:      max_upload_parts
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_MAX_UPLOAD_PARTS
- Type:        int
- Default:     10000

#### --s3-copy-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to multipart copy.

Any files larger than this that need to be server-side copied will be
copied in chunks of this size.

The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.

Properties:

- Config:      copy_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_COPY_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     4.656Gi

#### --s3-disable-checksum

Don't store MD5 checksum with object metadata.

Normally rclone will calculate the MD5 checksum of the input before
uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great
for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files
to start uploading.

Properties:

- Config:      disable_checksum
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_DISABLE_CHECKSUM
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-shared-credentials-file

Path to the shared credentials file.

If env_auth = true then rclone can use a shared credentials file.

If this variable is empty rclone will look for the
"AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE" env variable. If the env value is empty
it will default to the current user's home directory.

    Linux/OSX: "$HOME/.aws/credentials"
    Windows:   "%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials"


Properties:

- Config:      shared_credentials_file
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --s3-profile

Profile to use in the shared credentials file.

If env_auth = true then rclone can use a shared credentials file. This
variable controls which profile is used in that file.

If empty it will default to the environment variable "AWS_PROFILE" or
"default" if that environment variable is also not set.


Properties:

- Config:      profile
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_PROFILE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --s3-session-token

An AWS session token.

Properties:

- Config:      session_token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SESSION_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --s3-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads and copies.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently for multipart uploads and copies.

If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links
and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing
this may help to speed up the transfers.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     4

#### --s3-force-path-style

If true use path style access if false use virtual hosted style.

If this is true (the default) then rclone will use path style access,
if false then rclone will use virtual path style. See [the AWS S3
docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro)
for more info.

Some providers (e.g. AWS, Aliyun OSS, Netease COS, or Tencent COS) require this set to
false - rclone will do this automatically based on the provider
setting.

Note that if your bucket isn't a valid DNS name, i.e. has '.' or '_' in,
you'll need to set this to true.


Properties:

- Config:      force_path_style
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --s3-v2-auth

If true use v2 authentication.

If this is false (the default) then rclone will use v4 authentication.
If it is set then rclone will use v2 authentication.

Use this only if v4 signatures don't work, e.g. pre Jewel/v10 CEPH.

Properties:

- Config:      v2_auth
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_V2_AUTH
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-use-dual-stack

If true use AWS S3 dual-stack endpoint (IPv6 support).

See [AWS Docs on Dualstack Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/dual-stack-endpoints.html)

Properties:

- Config:      use_dual_stack
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_USE_DUAL_STACK
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-use-accelerate-endpoint

If true use the AWS S3 accelerated endpoint.

See: [AWS S3 Transfer acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration-examples.html)

Properties:

- Config:      use_accelerate_endpoint
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_USE_ACCELERATE_ENDPOINT
- Provider:    AWS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-leave-parts-on-error

If true avoid calling abort upload on a failure, leaving all successfully uploaded parts on S3 for manual recovery.

It should be set to true for resuming uploads across different sessions.

WARNING: Storing parts of an incomplete multipart upload counts towards space usage on S3 and will add additional costs if not cleaned up.


Properties:

- Config:      leave_parts_on_error
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_LEAVE_PARTS_ON_ERROR
- Provider:    AWS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-list-chunk

Size of listing chunk (response list for each ListObject S3 request).

This option is also known as "MaxKeys", "max-items", or "page-size" from the AWS S3 specification.
Most services truncate the response list to 1000 objects even if requested more than that.
In AWS S3 this is a global maximum and cannot be changed, see [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/ls.html).
In Ceph, this can be increased with the "rgw list buckets max chunk" option.


Properties:

- Config:      list_chunk
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_LIST_CHUNK
- Type:        int
- Default:     1000

#### --s3-list-version

Version of ListObjects to use: 1,2 or 0 for auto.

When S3 originally launched it only provided the ListObjects call to
enumerate objects in a bucket.

However in May 2016 the ListObjectsV2 call was introduced. This is
much higher performance and should be used if at all possible.

If set to the default, 0, rclone will guess according to the provider
set which list objects method to call. If it guesses wrong, then it
may be set manually here.


Properties:

- Config:      list_version
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_LIST_VERSION
- Type:        int
- Default:     0

#### --s3-list-url-encode

Whether to url encode listings: true/false/unset

Some providers support URL encoding listings and where this is
available this is more reliable when using control characters in file
names. If this is set to unset (the default) then rclone will choose
according to the provider setting what to apply, but you can override
rclone's choice here.


Properties:

- Config:      list_url_encode
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_LIST_URL_ENCODE
- Type:        Tristate
- Default:     unset

#### --s3-no-check-bucket

If set, don't attempt to check the bucket exists or create it.

This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions
rclone does if you know the bucket exists already.

It can also be needed if the user you are using does not have bucket
creation permissions. Before v1.52.0 this would have passed silently
due to a bug.


Properties:

- Config:      no_check_bucket
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_NO_CHECK_BUCKET
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-no-head

If set, don't HEAD uploaded objects to check integrity.

This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions
rclone does.

Setting it means that if rclone receives a 200 OK message after
uploading an object with PUT then it will assume that it got uploaded
properly.

In particular it will assume:

- the metadata, including modtime, storage class and content type was as uploaded
- the size was as uploaded

It reads the following items from the response for a single part PUT:

- the MD5SUM
- The uploaded date

For multipart uploads these items aren't read.

If an source object of unknown length is uploaded then rclone **will** do a
HEAD request.

Setting this flag increases the chance for undetected upload failures,
in particular an incorrect size, so it isn't recommended for normal
operation. In practice the chance of an undetected upload failure is
very small even with this flag.


Properties:

- Config:      no_head
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_NO_HEAD
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-no-head-object

If set, do not do HEAD before GET when getting objects.

Properties:

- Config:      no_head_object
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_NO_HEAD_OBJECT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --s3-memory-pool-flush-time

How often internal memory buffer pools will be flushed. (no longer used)

Properties:

- Config:      memory_pool_flush_time
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_MEMORY_POOL_FLUSH_TIME
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --s3-memory-pool-use-mmap

Whether to use mmap buffers in internal memory pool. (no longer used)

Properties:

- Config:      memory_pool_use_mmap
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_MEMORY_POOL_USE_MMAP
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-disable-http2

Disable usage of http2 for S3 backends.

There is currently an unsolved issue with the s3 (specifically minio) backend
and HTTP/2.  HTTP/2 is enabled by default for the s3 backend but can be
disabled here.  When the issue is solved this flag will be removed.

See: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4673, https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3631



Properties:

- Config:      disable_http2
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_DISABLE_HTTP2
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-download-url

Custom endpoint for downloads.
This is usually set to a CloudFront CDN URL as AWS S3 offers
cheaper egress for data downloaded through the CloudFront network.

Properties:

- Config:      download_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_DOWNLOAD_URL
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --s3-directory-markers

Upload an empty object with a trailing slash when a new directory is created

Empty folders are unsupported for bucket based remotes, this option creates an empty
object ending with "/", to persist the folder.


Properties:

- Config:      directory_markers
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_DIRECTORY_MARKERS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-use-multipart-etag

Whether to use ETag in multipart uploads for verification

This should be true, false or left unset to use the default for the provider.


Properties:

- Config:      use_multipart_etag
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_USE_MULTIPART_ETAG
- Type:        Tristate
- Default:     unset

#### --s3-use-unsigned-payload

Whether to use an unsigned payload in PutObject

Rclone has to avoid the AWS SDK seeking the body when calling
PutObject. The AWS provider can add checksums in the trailer to avoid
seeking but other providers can't.

This should be true, false or left unset to use the default for the provider.


Properties:

- Config:      use_unsigned_payload
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_USE_UNSIGNED_PAYLOAD
- Type:        Tristate
- Default:     unset

#### --s3-use-presigned-request

Whether to use a presigned request or PutObject for single part uploads

If this is false rclone will use PutObject from the AWS SDK to upload
an object.

Versions of rclone < 1.59 use presigned requests to upload a single
part object and setting this flag to true will re-enable that
functionality. This shouldn't be necessary except in exceptional
circumstances or for testing.


Properties:

- Config:      use_presigned_request
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_USE_PRESIGNED_REQUEST
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-versions

Include old versions in directory listings.

Properties:

- Config:      versions
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_VERSIONS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-version-at

Show file versions as they were at the specified time.

The parameter should be a date, "2006-01-02", datetime "2006-01-02
15:04:05" or a duration for that long ago, eg "100d" or "1h".

Note that when using this no file write operations are permitted,
so you can't upload files or delete them.

See [the time option docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#time-option) for valid formats.


Properties:

- Config:      version_at
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_VERSION_AT
- Type:        Time
- Default:     off

#### --s3-version-deleted

Show deleted file markers when using versions.

This shows deleted file markers in the listing when using versions. These will appear
as 0 size files. The only operation which can be performed on them is deletion.

Deleting a delete marker will reveal the previous version.

Deleted files will always show with a timestamp.


Properties:

- Config:      version_deleted
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_VERSION_DELETED
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-decompress

If set this will decompress gzip encoded objects.

It is possible to upload objects to S3 with "Content-Encoding: gzip"
set. Normally rclone will download these files as compressed objects.

If this flag is set then rclone will decompress these files with
"Content-Encoding: gzip" as they are received. This means that rclone
can't check the size and hash but the file contents will be decompressed.


Properties:

- Config:      decompress
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_DECOMPRESS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-might-gzip

Set this if the backend might gzip objects.

Normally providers will not alter objects when they are downloaded. If
an object was not uploaded with `Content-Encoding: gzip` then it won't
be set on download.

However some providers may gzip objects even if they weren't uploaded
with `Content-Encoding: gzip` (eg Cloudflare).

A symptom of this would be receiving errors like

    ERROR corrupted on transfer: sizes differ NNN vs MMM

If you set this flag and rclone downloads an object with
Content-Encoding: gzip set and chunked transfer encoding, then rclone
will decompress the object on the fly.

If this is set to unset (the default) then rclone will choose
according to the provider setting what to apply, but you can override
rclone's choice here.


Properties:

- Config:      might_gzip
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_MIGHT_GZIP
- Type:        Tristate
- Default:     unset

#### --s3-use-accept-encoding-gzip

Whether to send `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header.

By default, rclone will append `Accept-Encoding: gzip` to the request to download
compressed objects whenever possible.

However some providers such as Google Cloud Storage may alter the HTTP headers, breaking
the signature of the request.

A symptom of this would be receiving errors like

	SignatureDoesNotMatch: The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided.

In this case, you might want to try disabling this option.


Properties:

- Config:      use_accept_encoding_gzip
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_USE_ACCEPT_ENCODING_GZIP
- Type:        Tristate
- Default:     unset

#### --s3-no-system-metadata

Suppress setting and reading of system metadata

Properties:

- Config:      no_system_metadata
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_NO_SYSTEM_METADATA
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-sts-endpoint

Endpoint for STS (deprecated).

Leave blank if using AWS to use the default endpoint for the region.

Properties:

- Config:      sts_endpoint
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_STS_ENDPOINT
- Provider:    AWS
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --s3-use-already-exists

Set if rclone should report BucketAlreadyExists errors on bucket creation.

At some point during the evolution of the s3 protocol, AWS started
returning an `AlreadyOwnedByYou` error when attempting to create a
bucket that the user already owned, rather than a
`BucketAlreadyExists` error.

Unfortunately exactly what has been implemented by s3 clones is a
little inconsistent, some return `AlreadyOwnedByYou`, some return
`BucketAlreadyExists` and some return no error at all.

This is important to rclone because it ensures the bucket exists by
creating it on quite a lot of operations (unless
`--s3-no-check-bucket` is used).

If rclone knows the provider can return `AlreadyOwnedByYou` or returns
no error then it can report `BucketAlreadyExists` errors when the user
attempts to create a bucket not owned by them. Otherwise rclone
ignores the `BucketAlreadyExists` error which can lead to confusion.

This should be automatically set correctly for all providers rclone
knows about - please make a bug report if not.


Properties:

- Config:      use_already_exists
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_USE_ALREADY_EXISTS
- Type:        Tristate
- Default:     unset

#### --s3-use-multipart-uploads

Set if rclone should use multipart uploads.

You can change this if you want to disable the use of multipart uploads.
This shouldn't be necessary in normal operation.

This should be automatically set correctly for all providers rclone
knows about - please make a bug report if not.


Properties:

- Config:      use_multipart_uploads
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_USE_MULTIPART_UPLOADS
- Type:        Tristate
- Default:     unset

#### --s3-sdk-log-mode

Set to debug the SDK

This can be set to a comma separated list of the following functions:

- `Signing`
- `Retries`
- `Request`
- `RequestWithBody`
- `Response`
- `ResponseWithBody`
- `DeprecatedUsage`
- `RequestEventMessage`
- `ResponseEventMessage`

Use `Off` to disable and `All` to set all log levels. You will need to
use `-vv` to see the debug level logs.


Properties:

See the [metadata](https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata) docs for more info.

## Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the s3 backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the [backend](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command).

### restore

Restore objects from GLACIER or INTELLIGENT-TIERING archive tier

    rclone backend restore remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command can be used to restore one or more objects from GLACIER to normal storage 
or from INTELLIGENT-TIERING Archive Access / Deep Archive Access tier to the Frequent Access tier.

Usage Examples:

    rclone backend restore s3:bucket/path/to/object -o priority=PRIORITY -o lifetime=DAYS
    rclone backend restore s3:bucket/path/to/directory -o priority=PRIORITY -o lifetime=DAYS
    rclone backend restore s3:bucket -o priority=PRIORITY -o lifetime=DAYS
    rclone backend restore s3:bucket/path/to/directory -o priority=PRIORITY

This flag also obeys the filters. Test first with --interactive/-i or --dry-run flags

    rclone --interactive backend restore --include "*.txt" s3:bucket/path -o priority=Standard -o lifetime=1

All the objects shown will be marked for restore, then

    rclone backend restore --include "*.txt" s3:bucket/path -o priority=Standard -o lifetime=1

It returns a list of status dictionaries with Remote and Status
keys. The Status will be OK if it was successful or an error message
if not.

    [
        {
            "Status": "OK",
            "Remote": "test.txt"
        },
        {
            "Status": "OK",
            "Remote": "test/file4.txt"
        }
    ]



Options:

- "description": The optional description for the job.
- "lifetime": Lifetime of the active copy in days, ignored for INTELLIGENT-TIERING storage
- "priority": Priority of restore: Standard|Expedited|Bulk

### restore-status

Show the restore status for objects being restored from GLACIER or INTELLIGENT-TIERING storage

    rclone backend restore-status remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command can be used to show the status for objects being restored from GLACIER to normal storage
or from INTELLIGENT-TIERING Archive Access / Deep Archive Access tier to the Frequent Access tier.

Usage Examples:

    rclone backend restore-status s3:bucket/path/to/object
    rclone backend restore-status s3:bucket/path/to/directory
    rclone backend restore-status -o all s3:bucket/path/to/directory

This command does not obey the filters.

It returns a list of status dictionaries.

    [
        {
            "Remote": "file.txt",
            "VersionID": null,
            "RestoreStatus": {

            },
            "StorageClass": "INTELLIGENT_TIERING"
        }
    ]


Options:

- "all": if set then show all objects, not just ones with restore status

### list-multipart-uploads

List the unfinished multipart uploads

    rclone backend list-multipart-uploads remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command lists the unfinished multipart uploads in JSON format.

    rclone backend list-multipart s3:bucket/path/to/object

It returns a dictionary of buckets with values as lists of unfinished
multipart uploads.

You can call it with no bucket in which case it lists all bucket, with
a bucket or with a bucket and path.

    {
      "rclone": [
        {
          "Initiated": "2020-06-26T14:20:36Z",
          "Initiator": {
            "DisplayName": "XXX",
            "ID": "arn:aws:iam::XXX:user/XXX"
          },
          "Key": "KEY",
          "Owner": {
            "DisplayName": null,
            "ID": "XXX"
          },
          "StorageClass": "STANDARD",
          "UploadId": "XXX"
        }
      ],
      "rclone-1000files": [],
      "rclone-dst": []
    }



### cleanup

Remove unfinished multipart uploads.

    rclone backend cleanup remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command removes unfinished multipart uploads of age greater than
max-age which defaults to 24 hours.

Note that you can use --interactive/-i or --dry-run with this command to see what
it would do.

    rclone backend cleanup s3:bucket/path/to/object
    rclone backend cleanup -o max-age=7w s3:bucket/path/to/object

Durations are parsed as per the rest of rclone, 2h, 7d, 7w etc.


Options:

- "max-age": Max age of upload to delete

### cleanup-hidden

Remove old versions of files.

    rclone backend cleanup-hidden remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command removes any old hidden versions of files
on a versions enabled bucket.

Note that you can use --interactive/-i or --dry-run with this command to see what
it would do.

    rclone backend cleanup-hidden s3:bucket/path/to/dir


### versioning

Set/get versioning support for a bucket.

    rclone backend versioning remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command sets versioning support if a parameter is
passed and then returns the current versioning status for the bucket
supplied.

    rclone backend versioning s3:bucket # read status only
    rclone backend versioning s3:bucket Enabled
    rclone backend versioning s3:bucket Suspended

It may return "Enabled", "Suspended" or "Unversioned". Note that once versioning
has been enabled the status can't be set back to "Unversioned".


### set

Set command for updating the config parameters.

    rclone backend set remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This set command can be used to update the config parameters
for a running s3 backend.

Usage Examples:

    rclone backend set s3: [-o opt_name=opt_value] [-o opt_name2=opt_value2]
    rclone rc backend/command command=set fs=s3: [-o opt_name=opt_value] [-o opt_name2=opt_value2]
    rclone rc backend/command command=set fs=s3: -o session_token=X -o access_key_id=X -o secret_access_key=X

The option keys are named as they are in the config file.

This rebuilds the connection to the s3 backend when it is called with
the new parameters. Only new parameters need be passed as the values
will default to those currently in use.

It doesn't return anything.




### Anonymous access to public buckets {#anonymous-access}

If you want to use rclone to access a public bucket, configure with a
blank `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`.  Your config should end
up looking like this:

```
[anons3]
type = s3
provider = AWS
```

Then use it as normal with the name of the public bucket, e.g.

    rclone lsd anons3:1000genomes

You will be able to list and copy data but not upload it.

You can also do this entirely on the command line

    rclone lsd :s3,provider=AWS:1000genomes

## Providers

### AWS S3

This is the provider used as main example and described in the [configuration](#configuration) section above.

### AWS Snowball Edge

[AWS Snowball](https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/) is a hardware
appliance used for transferring bulk data back to AWS. Its main
software interface is S3 object storage.

To use rclone with AWS Snowball Edge devices, configure as standard
for an 'S3 Compatible Service'.

If using rclone pre v1.59 be sure to set `upload_cutoff = 0` otherwise
you will run into authentication header issues as the snowball device
does not support query parameter based authentication.

With rclone v1.59 or later setting `upload_cutoff` should not be necessary.

eg.
```
[snowball]
type = s3
provider = Other
access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
endpoint = http://[IP of Snowball]:8080
upload_cutoff = 0
```

### Ceph

[Ceph](https://ceph.com/) is an open-source, unified, distributed
storage system designed for excellent performance, reliability and
scalability.  It has an S3 compatible object storage interface.

To use rclone with Ceph, configure as above but leave the region blank
and set the endpoint.  You should end up with something like this in
your config:


```
[ceph]
type = s3
provider = Ceph
env_auth = false
access_key_id = XXX
secret_access_key = YYY
region =
endpoint = https://ceph.endpoint.example.com
location_constraint =
acl =
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
```

If you are using an older version of CEPH (e.g. 10.2.x Jewel) and a
version of rclone before v1.59 then you may need to supply the
parameter `--s3-upload-cutoff 0` or put this in the config file as
`upload_cutoff 0` to work around a bug which causes uploading of small
files to fail.

Note also that Ceph sometimes puts `/` in the passwords it gives
users.  If you read the secret access key using the command line tools
you will get a JSON blob with the `/` escaped as `\/`.  Make sure you
only write `/` in the secret access key.

Eg the dump from Ceph looks something like this (irrelevant keys
removed).

```
{
    "user_id": "xxx",
    "display_name": "xxxx",
    "keys": [
        {
            "user": "xxx",
            "access_key": "xxxxxx",
            "secret_key": "xxxxxx\/xxxx"
        }
    ],
}
```

Because this is a json dump, it is encoding the `/` as `\/`, so if you
use the secret key as `xxxxxx/xxxx`  it will work fine.

### Cloudflare R2 {#cloudflare-r2}

[Cloudflare R2](https://blog.cloudflare.com/r2-open-beta/) Storage
allows developers to store large amounts of unstructured data without
the costly egress bandwidth fees associated with typical cloud storage
services.

Here is an example of making a Cloudflare R2 configuration. First run:

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

Note that all buckets are private, and all are stored in the same
"auto" region. It is necessary to use Cloudflare workers to share the
content of a bucket publicly.

n) No (default)
y/n> n
--------------------

This will leave your config looking something like:

```

provider = Cloudflare
access_key_id = ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key = SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
region = auto
endpoint = https://ACCOUNT_ID.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
acl = private
```

Now run `rclone lsf r2:` to see your buckets and `rclone lsf
r2:bucket` to look within a bucket.

For R2 tokens with the "Object Read & Write" permission, you may also
need to add `no_check_bucket = true` for object uploads to work
correctly.

Note that Cloudflare decompresses files uploaded with
`Content-Encoding: gzip` by default which is a deviation from what AWS
does. If this is causing a problem then upload the files with
`--header-upload "Cache-Control: no-transform"`

### Dreamhost

Dreamhost [DreamObjects](https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/) is
an object storage system based on CEPH.

To use rclone with Dreamhost, configure as above but leave the region blank
and set the endpoint.  You should end up with something like this in
your config:

```
[dreamobjects]
type = s3
provider = DreamHost
env_auth = false
access_key_id = your_access_key
secret_access_key = your_secret_key
region =
endpoint = objects-us-west-1.dream.io
location_constraint =
acl = private
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
```

### Google Cloud Storage

[GoogleCloudStorage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs) is an [S3-interoperable](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/interoperability) object storage service from Google Cloud Platform.

To connect to Google Cloud Storage you will need an access key and secret key. These can be retrieved by creating an [HMAC key](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/managing-hmackeys).

```
[gs]
type = s3
provider = GCS
access_key_id = your_access_key
secret_access_key = your_secret_key
endpoint = https://storage.googleapis.com
```

**Note** that `--s3-versions` does not work with GCS when it needs to do directory paging. Rclone will return the error:

    s3 protocol error: received versions listing with IsTruncated set with no NextKeyMarker

This is Google bug [#312292516](https://issuetracker.google.com/u/0/issues/312292516).

### DigitalOcean Spaces

[Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/object-storage/) is an [S3-interoperable](https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/spaces/) object storage service from cloud provider DigitalOcean.

To connect to DigitalOcean Spaces you will need an access key and secret key. These can be retrieved on the "[Applications & API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/api/tokens)" page of the DigitalOcean control panel. They will be needed when prompted by `rclone config` for your `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`.

When prompted for a `region` or `location_constraint`, press enter to use the default value. The region must be included in the `endpoint` setting (e.g. `nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com`). The default values can be used for other settings.

Going through the whole process of creating a new remote by running `rclone config`, each prompt should be answered as shown below:

```
Storage> s3
env_auth> 1
access_key_id> YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key> YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region>
endpoint> nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
location_constraint>
acl>
storage_class>
```

The resulting configuration file should look like:

```
[spaces]
type = s3
provider = DigitalOcean
env_auth = false
access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region =
endpoint = nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
location_constraint =
acl =
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
```

Once configured, you can create a new Space and begin copying files. For example:

```
rclone mkdir spaces:my-new-space
rclone copy /path/to/files spaces:my-new-space
```

### Huawei OBS {#huawei-obs}

Object Storage Service (OBS) provides stable, secure, efficient, and easy-to-use cloud storage that lets you store virtually any volume of unstructured data in any format and access it from anywhere.

OBS provides an S3 interface, you can copy and modify the following configuration and add it to your rclone configuration file.
```
[obs]
type = s3
provider = HuaweiOBS
access_key_id = your-access-key-id
secret_access_key = your-secret-access-key

### Minio

[Minio](https://minio.io/) is an object storage server built for cloud application developers and devops.

It is very easy to install and provides an S3 compatible server which can be used by rclone.

To use it, install Minio following the instructions [here](https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide).

When it configures itself Minio will print something like this

```
Endpoint:  http://192.168.1.106:9000  http://172.23.0.1:9000
AccessKey: USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
SecretKey: MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
Region:    us-east-1
SQS ARNs:  arn:minio:sqs:us-east-1:1:redis arn:minio:sqs:us-east-1:2:redis

Browser Access:
   http://192.168.1.106:9000  http://172.23.0.1:9000

Command-line Access: https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide
   $ mc config host add myminio http://192.168.1.106:9000 USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03

Object API (Amazon S3 compatible):
   Go:         https://docs.minio.io/docs/golang-client-quickstart-guide
   Java:       https://docs.minio.io/docs/java-client-quickstart-guide
   Python:     https://docs.minio.io/docs/python-client-quickstart-guide
   JavaScript: https://docs.minio.io/docs/javascript-client-quickstart-guide
   .NET:       https://docs.minio.io/docs/dotnet-client-quickstart-guide

Drive Capacity: 26 GiB Free, 165 GiB Total
```

These details need to go into `rclone config` like this.  Note that it
is important to put the region in as stated above.

```
env_auth> 1
access_key_id> USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
secret_access_key> MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
region> us-east-1
endpoint> http://192.168.1.106:9000
location_constraint>
server_side_encryption>
```

Which makes the config file look like this

```
[minio]
type = s3
provider = Minio
env_auth = false
access_key_id = USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
secret_access_key = MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
region = us-east-1
endpoint = http://192.168.1.106:9000
location_constraint =
server_side_encryption =
```

So once set up, for example, to copy files into a bucket

```
rclone copy /path/to/files minio:bucket
```

### RackCorp {#RackCorp}

[RackCorp Object Storage](https://www.rackcorp.com/storage/s3storage) is an S3 compatible object storage platform from your friendly cloud provider RackCorp. 
The service is fast, reliable, well priced and located in many strategic locations unserviced by others, to ensure you can maintain data sovereignty.

Before you can use RackCorp Object Storage, you'll need to "[sign up](https://www.rackcorp.com/signup)" for an account on our "[portal](https://portal.rackcorp.com)".
Next you can create an `access key`, a `secret key` and `buckets`, in your location of choice with ease. 
These details are required for the next steps of configuration, when `rclone config` asks for your `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`.

Your config should end up looking a bit like this:

```
[RCS3-demo-config]
type = s3
provider = RackCorp
env_auth = true
access_key_id = YOURACCESSKEY
secret_access_key = YOURSECRETACCESSKEY
region = au-nsw
endpoint = s3.rackcorp.com
location_constraint = au-nsw
```

### Rclone Serve S3 {#rclone}

Rclone can serve any remote over the S3 protocol. For details see the
[rclone serve s3](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_http/) documentation.

For example, to serve `remote:path` over s3, run the server like this:

```
rclone serve s3 --auth-key ACCESS_KEY_ID,SECRET_ACCESS_KEY remote:path
```

This will be compatible with an rclone remote which is defined like this:

```
[serves3]
type = s3
provider = Rclone
endpoint = http://127.0.0.1:8080/
access_key_id = ACCESS_KEY_ID
secret_access_key = SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
use_multipart_uploads = false
```

Note that setting `disable_multipart_uploads = true` is to work around
[a bug](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_http/#bugs) which will be fixed in due course.

### Scaleway

[Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/object-storage/) The Object Storage platform allows you to store anything from backups, logs and web assets to documents and photos.
Files can be dropped from the Scaleway console or transferred through our API and CLI or using any S3-compatible tool.

Scaleway provides an S3 interface which can be configured for use with rclone like this:

```
[scaleway]
type = s3
provider = Scaleway
env_auth = false
endpoint = s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
access_key_id = SCWXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
secret_access_key = 1111111-2222-3333-44444-55555555555555
region = nl-ams
location_constraint = nl-ams
acl = private
upload_cutoff = 5M
chunk_size = 5M
copy_cutoff = 5M
```

[C14 Cold Storage](https://www.online.net/en/storage/c14-cold-storage) is the low-cost S3 Glacier alternative from Scaleway and it works the same way as on S3 by accepting the "GLACIER" `storage_class`.
So you can configure your remote with the `storage_class = GLACIER` option to upload directly to C14. Don't forget that in this state you can't read files back after, you will need to restore them to "STANDARD" storage_class first before being able to read them (see "restore" section above)

### Seagate Lyve Cloud {#lyve}

[Seagate Lyve Cloud](https://www.seagate.com/gb/en/services/cloud/storage/) is an S3
compatible object storage platform from [Seagate](https://seagate.com/) intended for enterprise use.

Here is a config run through for a remote called `remote` - you may
choose a different name of course. Note that to create an access key
and secret key you will need to create a service account first.

```
$ rclone config
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
```

Choose `s3` backend

### SeaweedFS

[SeaweedFS](https://github.com/chrislusf/seaweedfs/) is a distributed storage system for 
blobs, objects, files, and data lake, with O(1) disk seek and a scalable file metadata store.
It has an S3 compatible object storage interface. SeaweedFS can also act as a 
[gateway to remote S3 compatible object store](https://github.com/chrislusf/seaweedfs/wiki/Gateway-to-Remote-Object-Storage) 
to cache data and metadata with asynchronous write back, for fast local speed and minimize access cost.

Assuming the SeaweedFS are configured with `weed shell` as such:
```
> s3.bucket.create -name foo
> s3.configure -access_key=any -secret_key=any -buckets=foo -user=me -actions=Read,Write,List,Tagging,Admin -apply
{
  "identities": [
    {
      "name": "me",
      "credentials": [
        {
          "accessKey": "any",
          "secretKey": "any"
        }
      ],
      "actions": [
        "Read:foo",
        "Write:foo",
        "List:foo",
        "Tagging:foo",
        "Admin:foo"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

To use rclone with SeaweedFS, above configuration should end up with something like this in
your config:

```
[seaweedfs_s3]
type = s3
provider = SeaweedFS
access_key_id = any
secret_access_key = any
endpoint = localhost:8333
```

So once set up, for example to copy files into a bucket

```
rclone copy /path/to/files seaweedfs_s3:foo
```

### Wasabi

[Wasabi](https://wasabi.com) is a cloud-based object storage service for a
broad range of applications and use cases. Wasabi is designed for
individuals and organizations that require a high-performance,
reliable, and secure data storage infrastructure at minimal cost.

### Storj

Storj is a decentralized cloud storage which can be used through its
native protocol or an S3 compatible gateway.

type of `s3` and with a provider name of `Storj`. Here is an example
run of the configurator.

```

   \ (gateway.ap1.storjshare.io)
endpoint> 1 (as shown when creating the access grant)
Edit advanced config?
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
```

Note that s3 credentials are generated when you [create an access
grant](https://docs.storj.io/dcs/api-reference/s3-compatible-gateway#usage).

#### Backend quirks

- `--chunk-size` is forced to be 64 MiB or greater. This will use more
  memory than the default of 5 MiB.
- Server side copy is disabled as it isn't currently supported in the
  gateway.
- GetTier and SetTier are not supported.

#### Backend bugs

Due to [issue #39](https://github.com/storj/gateway-mt/issues/39)
uploading multipart files via the S3 gateway causes them to lose their
metadata. For rclone's purpose this means that the modification time
is not stored, nor is any MD5SUM (if one is available from the
source).

This has the following consequences:

- Using `rclone rcat` will fail as the medatada doesn't match after upload
- Uploading files with `rclone mount` will fail for the same reason
    - This can worked around by using `--vfs-cache-mode writes` or `--vfs-cache-mode full` or setting `--s3-upload-cutoff` large
- Files uploaded via a multipart upload won't have their modtimes
    - This will mean that `rclone sync` will likely keep trying to upload files bigger than `--s3-upload-cutoff`
    - This can be worked around with `--checksum` or `--size-only` or setting `--s3-upload-cutoff` large
    - The maximum value for `--s3-upload-cutoff` is 5GiB though

One general purpose workaround is to set `--s3-upload-cutoff 5G`. This
means that rclone will upload files smaller than 5GiB as single parts.
Note that this can be set in the config file with `upload_cutoff = 5G`
or configured in the advanced settings. If you regularly transfer
files larger than 5G then using `--checksum` or `--size-only` in
`rclone sync` is the recommended workaround.

#### Comparison with the native protocol

Use the [the native protocol](/storj) to take advantage of
client-side encryption as well as to achieve the best possible
download performance. Uploads will be erasure-coded locally, thus a
1gb upload will result in 2.68gb of data being uploaded to storage
nodes across the network.

Use this backend and the S3 compatible Hosted Gateway to increase
upload performance and reduce the load on your systems and network.
Uploads will be encrypted and erasure-coded server-side, thus a 1GB
upload will result in only in 1GB of data being uploaded to storage
nodes across the network.

For more detailed comparison please check the documentation of the
[storj](/storj) backend.

## Memory usage {memory}

The most common cause of rclone using lots of memory is a single
directory with millions of files in. Despite s3 not really having the
concepts of directories, rclone does the sync on a directory by
directory basis to be compatible with normal filing systems.

Rclone loads each directory into memory as rclone objects. Each rclone
object takes 0.5k-1k of memory, so approximately 1GB per 1,000,000
files, and the sync for that directory does not begin until it is
entirely loaded in memory. So the sync can take a long time to start
for large directories.

To sync a directory with 100,000,000 files in you would need approximately
100 GB of memory. At some point the amount of memory becomes difficult
to provide so there is
[a workaround for this](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/wiki/Big-syncs-with-millions-of-files)
which involves a bit of scripting.

At some point rclone will gain a sync mode which is effectively this
workaround but built in to rclone.

## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the S3 backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) and [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Backblaze B2

B2 is [Backblaze's cloud storage system](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage).

Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of making a b2 configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.  To authenticate
you will either need your Account ID (a short hex number) and Master
Application Key (a long hex number) OR an Application Key, which is the
recommended method. See below for further details on generating and using
an Application Key.

- endpoint:

d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Create a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote bucket, deleting any
excess files in the bucket.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:bucket

### Application Keys

B2 supports multiple [Application Keys for different access permission
to B2 Buckets](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-application-keys).

You can use these with rclone too; you will need to use rclone version 1.43
or later.

Follow Backblaze's docs to create an Application Key with the required
permission and add the `applicationKeyId` as the `account` and the
`Application Key` itself as the `key`.

Note that you must put the _applicationKeyId_ as the `account` – you
can't use the master Account ID.  If you try then B2 will return 401
errors.

### --fast-list

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

### Modification times

The modification time is stored as metadata on the object as
`X-Bz-Info-src_last_modified_millis` as milliseconds since 1970-01-01
in the Backblaze standard.  Other tools should be able to use this as
a modified time.

Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported. Note that
if a modification time needs to be updated on an object then it will
create a new version of the object.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

Note that in 2020-05 Backblaze started allowing \ characters in file
names. Rclone hasn't changed its encoding as this could cause syncs to
re-transfer files. If you want rclone not to replace \ then see the
`--b2-encoding` flag below and remove the `BackSlash` from the
string. This can be set in the config.

### SHA1 checksums

The SHA1 checksums of the files are checked on upload and download and
will be used in the syncing process.

Large files (bigger than the limit in `--b2-upload-cutoff`) which are
uploaded in chunks will store their SHA1 on the object as
`X-Bz-Info-large_file_sha1` as recommended by Backblaze.

For a large file to be uploaded with an SHA1 checksum, the source
needs to support SHA1 checksums. The local disk supports SHA1
checksums so large file transfers from local disk will have an SHA1.
See [the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#features) for exactly which remotes
support SHA1.

Sources which don't support SHA1, in particular `crypt` will upload
large files without SHA1 checksums.  This may be fixed in the future
(see [#1767](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1767)).

Files sizes below `--b2-upload-cutoff` will always have an SHA1
regardless of the source.

### Transfers

Backblaze recommends that you do lots of transfers simultaneously for
maximum speed.  In tests from my SSD equipped laptop the optimum
setting is about `--transfers 32` though higher numbers may be used
for a slight speed improvement. The optimum number for you may vary
depending on your hardware, how big the files are, how much you want
to load your computer, etc.  The default of `--transfers 4` is
definitely too low for Backblaze B2 though.

Note that uploading big files (bigger than 200 MiB by default) will use
a 96 MiB RAM buffer by default.  There can be at most `--transfers` of
these in use at any moment, so this sets the upper limit on the memory
used.

### Versions

The default setting of B2 is to keep old versions of files. This means
when rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a [new version
of it](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-file-versions).
Likewise when you delete a file, the old version will be marked hidden
and still be available.

Whether B2 keeps old versions of files or not can be adjusted on a per
bucket basis using the "Lifecycle settings" on the B2 control panel or
when creating the bucket using the [--b2-lifecycle](#b2-lifecycle)
flag or after creation using the [rclone backend lifecycle](#lifecycle)
command.

You may opt in to a "hard delete" of files with the `--b2-hard-delete`
flag which permanently removes files on deletion instead of hiding
them.

Old versions of files, where available, are visible using the 
`--b2-versions` flag.

It is also possible to view a bucket as it was at a certain point in time,
using the `--b2-version-at` flag. This will show the file versions as they
were at that time, showing files that have been deleted afterwards, and
hiding files that were created since.

If you wish to remove all the old versions, and unfinished large file
uploads, then you can use the `rclone cleanup remote:bucket` command
which will delete all the old versions of files, leaving the current ones
intact.  You can also supply a path and only old versions under that path
will be deleted, e.g. `rclone cleanup remote:bucket/path/to/stuff`.

Note that `cleanup` will remove partially uploaded files from the bucket
if they are more than a day old. If you want more control over the
expiry date then run `rclone backend cleanup b2:bucket -o max-age=1h`
to remove all unfinished large file uploads older than one hour, leaving
old versions intact.

If you wish to remove all the old versions, leaving current files and
unfinished large files intact, then you can use the
[`rclone backend cleanup-hidden remote:bucket`](#cleanup-hidden)
command. You can also supply a path and only old versions under that
path will be deleted, e.g.
`rclone backend cleanup-hidden remote:bucket/path/to/stuff`.

When you `purge` a bucket, the current and the old versions will be
deleted then the bucket will be deleted.

However `delete` will cause the current versions of the files to
become hidden old versions.

Here is a session showing the listing and retrieval of an old
version followed by a `cleanup` of the old versions.

Show current version and all the versions with `--b2-versions` flag.

```
$ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt

$ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt
        8 one-v2016-07-04-141032-000.txt
       16 one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
       15 one-v2016-07-02-155621-000.txt
```

Retrieve an old version

```
$ rclone -q --b2-versions copy b2:cleanup-test/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt /tmp

$ ls -l /tmp/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ncw ncw 16 Jul  2 17:46 /tmp/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
```

Clean up all the old versions and show that they've gone.

```
$ rclone -q cleanup b2:cleanup-test

$ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt

$ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt
```

#### Versions naming caveat

When using `--b2-versions` flag rclone is relying on the file name
to work out whether the objects are versions or not. Versions' names
are created by inserting timestamp between file name and its extension.
```
        9 file.txt
        8 file-v2023-07-17-161032-000.txt
       16 file-v2023-06-15-141003-000.txt
```
If there are real files present with the same names as versions, then
behaviour of `--b2-versions` can be unpredictable.

### Data usage

It is useful to know how many requests are sent to the server in different scenarios.

All copy commands send the following 4 requests:

```
/b2api/v1/b2_authorize_account
/b2api/v1/b2_create_bucket
/b2api/v1/b2_list_buckets
/b2api/v1/b2_list_file_names
```

The `b2_list_file_names` request will be sent once for every 1k files
in the remote path, providing the checksum and modification time of
the listed files. As of version 1.33 issue
[#818](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/818) causes extra requests
to be sent when using B2 with Crypt. When a copy operation does not
require any files to be uploaded, no more requests will be sent.

Uploading files that do not require chunking, will send 2 requests per
file upload:

```
/b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_url
/b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/
```

Uploading files requiring chunking, will send 2 requests (one each to
start and finish the upload) and another 2 requests for each chunk:

```
/b2api/v1/b2_start_large_file
/b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_part_url
/b2api/v1/b2_upload_part/
/b2api/v1/b2_finish_large_file
```

#### Versions

Versions can be viewed with the `--b2-versions` flag. When it is set
rclone will show and act on older versions of files.  For example

Listing without `--b2-versions`

```
$ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt
```

And with

```
$ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt
        8 one-v2016-07-04-141032-000.txt
       16 one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
       15 one-v2016-07-02-155621-000.txt
```

Showing that the current version is unchanged but older versions can
be seen.  These have the UTC date that they were uploaded to the
server to the nearest millisecond appended to them.

Note that when using `--b2-versions` no file write operations are
permitted, so you can't upload files or delete them.

### B2 and rclone link

Rclone supports generating file share links for private B2 buckets.
They can either be for a file for example:

```
./rclone link B2:bucket/path/to/file.txt
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file.txt?Authorization=xxxxxxxx

```

or if run on a directory you will get:

```
./rclone link B2:bucket/path
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
```

you can then use the authorization token (the part of the url from the
 `?Authorization=` on) on any file path under that directory. For example:

```
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file1?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/file2?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/folder/file3?Authorization=xxxxxxxx

```

- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --b2-test-mode

A flag string for X-Bz-Test-Mode header for debugging.

This is for debugging purposes only. Setting it to one of the strings
below will cause b2 to return specific errors:

  * "fail_some_uploads"
  * "expire_some_account_authorization_tokens"
  * "force_cap_exceeded"

These will be set in the "X-Bz-Test-Mode" header which is documented
in the [b2 integrations checklist](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-integration-checklist).

Properties:

- Config:      test_mode
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_TEST_MODE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --b2-versions

Include old versions in directory listings.

Note that when using this no file write operations are permitted,
so you can't upload files or delete them.

Properties:

- Config:      versions
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_VERSIONS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --b2-version-at

Show file versions as they were at the specified time.

Note that when using this no file write operations are permitted,
so you can't upload files or delete them.

Properties:

- Config:      version_at
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_VERSION_AT
- Type:        Time
- Default:     off

#### --b2-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload.

Files above this size will be uploaded in chunks of "--b2-chunk-size".

This value should be set no larger than 4.657 GiB (== 5 GB).

Properties:

- Config:      upload_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     200Mi

#### --b2-copy-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to multipart copy.

Any files larger than this that need to be server-side copied will be
copied in chunks of this size.

The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 4.6 GiB.

Properties:

- Config:      copy_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_COPY_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     4Gi

#### --b2-chunk-size

Upload chunk size.

When uploading large files, chunk the file into this size.

Must fit in memory. These chunks are buffered in memory and there
might a maximum of "--transfers" chunks in progress at once.

5,000,000 Bytes is the minimum size.

Properties:

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     96Mi

#### --b2-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently.

Note that chunks are stored in memory and there may be up to
"--transfers" * "--b2-upload-concurrency" chunks stored at once
in memory.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     4

#### --b2-disable-checksum

Disable checksums for large (> upload cutoff) files.

Normally rclone will calculate the SHA1 checksum of the input before
uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great
for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files
to start uploading.

Properties:

- Config:      disable_checksum
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_DISABLE_CHECKSUM
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --b2-download-url

Custom endpoint for downloads.

This is usually set to a Cloudflare CDN URL as Backblaze offers
free egress for data downloaded through the Cloudflare network.
Rclone works with private buckets by sending an "Authorization" header.
If the custom endpoint rewrites the requests for authentication,
e.g., in Cloudflare Workers, this header needs to be handled properly.
Leave blank if you want to use the endpoint provided by Backblaze.

The URL provided here SHOULD have the protocol and SHOULD NOT have
a trailing slash or specify the /file/bucket subpath as rclone will
request files with "{download_url}/file/{bucket_name}/{path}".

Example:
> https://mysubdomain.mydomain.tld
(No trailing "/", "file" or "bucket")

Properties:

- Config:      download_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_DOWNLOAD_URL
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --b2-download-auth-duration

Time before the public link authorization token will expire in s or suffix ms|s|m|h|d.

This is used in combination with "rclone link" for making files
accessible to the public and sets the duration before the download
authorization token will expire.

The minimum value is 1 second. The maximum value is one week.

Properties:

- Config:      download_auth_duration
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_DOWNLOAD_AUTH_DURATION
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1w

#### --b2-memory-pool-flush-time

How often internal memory buffer pools will be flushed. (no longer used)

Properties:

- Config:      memory_pool_flush_time
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_MEMORY_POOL_FLUSH_TIME
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --b2-memory-pool-use-mmap

Whether to use mmap buffers in internal memory pool. (no longer used)

Properties:

- Config:      memory_pool_use_mmap
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_MEMORY_POOL_USE_MMAP
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --b2-lifecycle

Set the number of days deleted files should be kept when creating a bucket.

On bucket creation, this parameter is used to create a lifecycle rule
for the entire bucket.

If lifecycle is 0 (the default) it does not create a lifecycle rule so
the default B2 behaviour applies. This is to create versions of files
on delete and overwrite and to keep them indefinitely.

If lifecycle is >0 then it creates a single rule setting the number of
days before a file that is deleted or overwritten is deleted
permanently. This is known as daysFromHidingToDeleting in the b2 docs.

The minimum value for this parameter is 1 day.

You can also enable hard_delete in the config also which will mean
deletions won't cause versions but overwrites will still cause
versions to be made.

See: [rclone backend lifecycle](#lifecycle) for setting lifecycles after bucket creation.


Properties:

- Config:      lifecycle
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_LIFECYCLE
- Type:        int
- Default:     0

#### --b2-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --b2-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

## Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the b2 backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the [backend](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command).

### lifecycle

Read or set the lifecycle for a bucket

    rclone backend lifecycle remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command can be used to read or set the lifecycle for a bucket.

Usage Examples:

To show the current lifecycle rules:

    rclone backend lifecycle b2:bucket

This will dump something like this showing the lifecycle rules.

    [
        {
            "daysFromHidingToDeleting": 1,
            "daysFromUploadingToHiding": null,
            "fileNamePrefix": ""
        }
    ]

If there are no lifecycle rules (the default) then it will just return [].

To reset the current lifecycle rules:

    rclone backend lifecycle b2:bucket -o daysFromHidingToDeleting=30
    rclone backend lifecycle b2:bucket -o daysFromUploadingToHiding=5 -o daysFromHidingToDeleting=1

This will run and then print the new lifecycle rules as above.

Rclone only lets you set lifecycles for the whole bucket with the
fileNamePrefix = "".

You can't disable versioning with B2. The best you can do is to set
the daysFromHidingToDeleting to 1 day. You can enable hard_delete in
the config also which will mean deletions won't cause versions but
overwrites will still cause versions to be made.

    rclone backend lifecycle b2:bucket -o daysFromHidingToDeleting=1

See: https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-lifecycle-rules


Options:

- "daysFromHidingToDeleting": After a file has been hidden for this many days it is deleted. 0 is off.
- "daysFromUploadingToHiding": This many days after uploading a file is hidden

### cleanup

Remove unfinished large file uploads.

    rclone backend cleanup remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command removes unfinished large file uploads of age greater than
max-age, which defaults to 24 hours.

Note that you can use --interactive/-i or --dry-run with this command to see what
it would do.

    rclone backend cleanup b2:bucket/path/to/object
    rclone backend cleanup -o max-age=7w b2:bucket/path/to/object

Durations are parsed as per the rest of rclone, 2h, 7d, 7w etc.


Options:

- "max-age": Max age of upload to delete

### cleanup-hidden

Remove old versions of files.

    rclone backend cleanup-hidden remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command removes any old hidden versions of files.

Note that you can use --interactive/-i or --dry-run with this command to see what
it would do.

    rclone backend cleanup-hidden b2:bucket/path/to/dir




## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the B2 backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) and [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Box

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

The initial setup for Box involves getting a token from Box which you
can do either in your browser, or with a config.json downloaded from Box
to use JWT authentication.  `rclone config` walks you through it.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Box
   \ "box"
[snip]
Storage> box
Box App Client Id - leave blank normally.
client_id> 
Box App Client Secret - leave blank normally.
client_secret>
Box App config.json location
Leave blank normally.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
box_config_file>
Box App Primary Access Token
Leave blank normally.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
access_token>

Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("user").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Rclone should act on behalf of a user
   \ "user"
 2 / Rclone should act on behalf of a service account
   \ "enterprise"
box_sub_type>
Remote config
Use web browser to automatically authenticate rclone with remote?
 * Say Y if the machine running rclone has a web browser you can use
 * Say N if running rclone on a (remote) machine without web browser access
If not sure try Y. If Y failed, try N.
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: box
- client_id:
- client_secret:
- token: {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"XXX"}
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Box. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.  This
is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require you to unblock
it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Box

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Box

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Box directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Using rclone with an Enterprise account with SSO

If you have an "Enterprise" account type with Box with single sign on
(SSO), you need to create a password to use Box with rclone. This can
be done at your Enterprise Box account by going to Settings, "Account"
Tab, and then set the password in the "Authentication" field.

Once you have done this, you can setup your Enterprise Box account
using the same procedure detailed above in the, using the password you
have just set.

### Invalid refresh token

According to the [box docs](https://developer.box.com/v2.0/docs/oauth-20#section-6-using-the-access-and-refresh-tokens):

> Each refresh_token is valid for one use in 60 days.

This means that if you

  * Don't use the box remote for 60 days
  * Copy the config file with a box refresh token in and use it in two places
  * Get an error on a token refresh

then rclone will return an error which includes the text `Invalid
refresh token`.

To fix this you will need to use oauth2 again to update the refresh
token.  You can use the methods in [the remote setup
docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/), bearing in mind that if you use the copy the
config file method, you should not use that remote on the computer you
did the authentication on.

Here is how to do it.

```
$ rclone config
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
remote               box

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config

- token: {"access_token":"YYY","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"YYY","expiry":"2017-07-23T12:22:29.259137901+01:00"}
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

### Modification times and hashes

Box allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.  These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

Box supports SHA1 type hashes, so you can use the `--checksum`
flag.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |

File names can also not end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Transfers

For files above 50 MiB rclone will use a chunked transfer.  Rclone will
upload up to `--transfers` chunks at the same time (shared among all
the multipart uploads).  Chunks are buffered in memory and are
normally 8 MiB so increasing `--transfers` will increase memory use.

### Deleting files

Depending on the enterprise settings for your user, the item will
either be actually deleted from Box or moved to the trash.

Emptying the trash is supported via the rclone however cleanup command
however this deletes every trashed file and folder individually so it
may take a very long time. 
Emptying the trash via the  WebUI does not have this limitation 
so it is advised to empty the trash via the WebUI.

### Root folder ID

You can set the `root_folder_id` for rclone.  This is the directory
(identified by its `Folder ID`) that rclone considers to be the root
of your Box drive.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the
correct root to use itself.

However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.

In order to do this you will have to find the `Folder ID` of the
directory you wish rclone to display.  This will be the last segment
of the URL when you open the relevant folder in the Box web
interface.

So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
`https://app.box.com/folder/11xxxxxxxxx8`
in the browser, then you use `11xxxxxxxxx8` as
the `root_folder_id` in the config.

## Limitations

Note that Box is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

Box file names can't have the `\` character in.  rclone maps this to
and from an identical looking unicode equivalent `＼` (U+FF3C Fullwidth
Reverse Solidus).

Box only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.

Box has [API rate limits](https://developer.box.com/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/rate-limits/) that sometimes reduce the speed of rclone.

`rclone about` is not supported by the Box backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) and [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

## Get your own Box App ID

Here is how to create your own Box App ID for rclone:

1. Go to the [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console)
and login, then click `My Apps` on the sidebar. Click `Create New App`
and select `Custom App`.

2. In the first screen on the box that pops up, you can pretty much enter
whatever you want. The `App Name` can be whatever. For `Purpose` choose
automation to avoid having to fill out anything else. Click `Next`.

3. In the second screen of the creation screen, select
`User Authentication (OAuth 2.0)`. Then click `Create App`.

4. You should now be on the `Configuration` tab of your new app. If not,
click on it at the top of the webpage. Copy down `Client ID`
and `Client Secret`, you'll need those for rclone.

5. Under "OAuth 2.0 Redirect URI", add `http://127.0.0.1:53682/`

6. For `Application Scopes`, select `Read all files and folders stored in Box`
and `Write all files and folders stored in box` (assuming you want to do both).
Leave others unchecked. Click `Save Changes` at the top right.

#  Cache

The `cache` remote wraps another existing remote and stores file structure
and its data for long running tasks like `rclone mount`.

## Status

The cache backend code is working but it currently doesn't
have a maintainer so there are [outstanding bugs](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+label%3A%22Remote%3A+Cache%22) which aren't getting fixed.

The cache backend is due to be phased out in favour of the VFS caching
layer eventually which is more tightly integrated into rclone.

Until this happens we recommend only using the cache backend if you
find you can't work without it. There are many docs online describing
the use of the cache backend to minimize API hits and by-and-large
these are out of date and the cache backend isn't needed in those
scenarios any more.

## Configuration

To get started you just need to have an existing remote which can be configured
with `cache`.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `test-cache`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/r/c/s/q> n
name> test-cache
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Cache a remote
   \ "cache"
[snip]
Storage> cache
Remote to cache.
Normally should contain a ':' and a path, e.g. "myremote:path/to/dir",
"myremote:bucket" or maybe "myremote:" (not recommended).
remote> local:/test
Optional: The URL of the Plex server
plex_url> http://127.0.0.1:32400
Optional: The username of the Plex user
plex_username> dummyusername
Optional: The password of the Plex user
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No leave this optional password blank
y/g/n> y
Enter the password:
password:
Confirm the password:
password:
The size of a chunk. Lower value good for slow connections but can affect seamless reading.
Default: 5M
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / 1 MiB
   \ "1M"
 2 / 5 MiB
   \ "5M"
 3 / 10 MiB
   \ "10M"
chunk_size> 2
How much time should object info (file size, file hashes, etc.) be stored in cache. Use a very high value if you don't plan on changing the source FS from outside the cache.
Accepted units are: "s", "m", "h".
Default: 5m
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / 1 hour
   \ "1h"
 2 / 24 hours
   \ "24h"
 3 / 24 hours
   \ "48h"
info_age> 2
The maximum size of stored chunks. When the storage grows beyond this size, the oldest chunks will be deleted.
Default: 10G
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / 500 MiB
   \ "500M"
 2 / 1 GiB
   \ "1G"
 3 / 10 GiB
   \ "10G"
chunk_total_size> 3
Remote config
--------------------
[test-cache]
remote = local:/test
plex_url = http://127.0.0.1:32400
plex_username = dummyusername
plex_password = *** ENCRYPTED ***
chunk_size = 5M
info_age = 48h
chunk_total_size = 10G
```

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your drive

    rclone lsd test-cache:

List all the files in your drive

    rclone ls test-cache:

To start a cached mount

    rclone mount --allow-other test-cache: /var/tmp/test-cache

### Write Features ###

### Offline uploading ###

In an effort to make writing through cache more reliable, the backend 
now supports this feature which can be activated by specifying a
`cache-tmp-upload-path`.

A files goes through these states when using this feature:

1. An upload is started (usually by copying a file on the cache remote)
2. When the copy to the temporary location is complete the file is part 
of the cached remote and looks and behaves like any other file (reading included)
3. After `cache-tmp-wait-time` passes and the file is next in line, `rclone move` 
is used to move the file to the cloud provider
4. Reading the file still works during the upload but most modifications on it will be prohibited
5. Once the move is complete the file is unlocked for modifications as it
becomes as any other regular file
6. If the file is being read through `cache` when it's actually
deleted from the temporary path then `cache` will simply swap the source
to the cloud provider without interrupting the reading (small blip can happen though)

Files are uploaded in sequence and only one file is uploaded at a time.
Uploads will be stored in a queue and be processed based on the order they were added.
The queue and the temporary storage is persistent across restarts but
can be cleared on startup with the `--cache-db-purge` flag.

### Write Support ###

Writes are supported through `cache`.
One caveat is that a mounted cache remote does not add any retry or fallback
mechanism to the upload operation. This will depend on the implementation
of the wrapped remote. Consider using `Offline uploading` for reliable writes.

One special case is covered with `cache-writes` which will cache the file
data at the same time as the upload when it is enabled making it available
from the cache store immediately once the upload is finished.

### Read Features ###

#### Multiple connections ####

To counter the high latency between a local PC where rclone is running
and cloud providers, the cache remote can split multiple requests to the
cloud provider for smaller file chunks and combines them together locally
where they can be available almost immediately before the reader usually
needs them.

This is similar to buffering when media files are played online. Rclone
will stay around the current marker but always try its best to stay ahead
and prepare the data before.

#### Plex Integration ####

There is a direct integration with Plex which allows cache to detect during reading
if the file is in playback or not. This helps cache to adapt how it queries
the cloud provider depending on what is needed for.

Scans will have a minimum amount of workers (1) while in a confirmed playback cache
will deploy the configured number of workers.

This integration opens the doorway to additional performance improvements
which will be explored in the near future.

**Note:** If Plex options are not configured, `cache` will function with its
configured options without adapting any of its settings.

How to enable? Run `rclone config` and add all the Plex options (endpoint, username
and password) in your remote and it will be automatically enabled.

Affected settings:
- `cache-workers`: _Configured value_ during confirmed playback or _1_ all the other times

##### Certificate Validation #####

When the Plex server is configured to only accept secure connections, it is
possible to use `.plex.direct` URLs to ensure certificate validation succeeds.
These URLs are used by Plex internally to connect to the Plex server securely.

The format for these URLs is the following:

`https://ip-with-dots-replaced.server-hash.plex.direct:32400/`

The `ip-with-dots-replaced` part can be any IPv4 address, where the dots
have been replaced with dashes, e.g. `127.0.0.1` becomes `127-0-0-1`.

To get the `server-hash` part, the easiest way is to visit

https://plex.tv/api/resources?includeHttps=1&X-Plex-Token=your-plex-token

This page will list all the available Plex servers for your account
with at least one `.plex.direct` link for each. Copy one URL and replace
the IP address with the desired address. This can be used as the
`plex_url` value.

### Known issues ###

#### Mount and --dir-cache-time ####

--dir-cache-time controls the first layer of directory caching which works at the mount layer.
Being an independent caching mechanism from the `cache` backend, it will manage its own entries
based on the configured time.

To avoid getting in a scenario where dir cache has obsolete data and cache would have the correct
one, try to set `--dir-cache-time` to a lower time than `--cache-info-age`. Default values are
already configured in this way. 

#### Windows support - Experimental ####

There are a couple of issues with Windows `mount` functionality that still require some investigations.
It should be considered as experimental thus far as fixes come in for this OS.

Most of the issues seem to be related to the difference between filesystems
on Linux flavors and Windows as cache is heavily dependent on them.

Any reports or feedback on how cache behaves on this OS is greatly appreciated.
 
- https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1935
- https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1907
- https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1834 

#### Risk of throttling ####

Future iterations of the cache backend will make use of the pooling functionality
of the cloud provider to synchronize and at the same time make writing through it
more tolerant to failures. 

There are a couple of enhancements in track to add these but in the meantime
there is a valid concern that the expiring cache listings can lead to cloud provider
throttles or bans due to repeated queries on it for very large mounts.

Some recommendations:
- don't use a very small interval for entry information (`--cache-info-age`)
- while writes aren't yet optimised, you can still write through `cache` which gives you the advantage
of adding the file in the cache at the same time if configured to do so.

Future enhancements:

- https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1937
- https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1936 

#### cache and crypt ####

One common scenario is to keep your data encrypted in the cloud provider
using the `crypt` remote. `crypt` uses a similar technique to wrap around
an existing remote and handles this translation in a seamless way.

There is an issue with wrapping the remotes in this order:
**cloud remote** -> **crypt** -> **cache**

During testing, I experienced a lot of bans with the remotes in this order.
I suspect it might be related to how crypt opens files on the cloud provider
which makes it think we're downloading the full file instead of small chunks.
Organizing the remotes in this order yields better results:
**cloud remote** -> **cache** -> **crypt**

#### absolute remote paths ####

`cache` can not differentiate between relative and absolute paths for the wrapped remote.
Any path given in the `remote` config setting and on the command line will be passed to
the wrapped remote as is, but for storing the chunks on disk the path will be made
relative by removing any leading `/` character.

This behavior is irrelevant for most backend types, but there are backends where a leading `/`
changes the effective directory, e.g. in the `sftp` backend paths starting with a `/` are
relative to the root of the SSH server and paths without are relative to the user home directory.
As a result `sftp:bin` and `sftp:/bin` will share the same cache folder, even if they represent
a different directory on the SSH server.

### Cache and Remote Control (--rc) ###
Cache supports the new `--rc` mode in rclone and can be remote controlled through the following end points:
By default, the listener is disabled if you do not add the flag.

### rc cache/expire
Purge a remote from the cache backend. Supports either a directory or a file.
It supports both encrypted and unencrypted file names if cache is wrapped by crypt.

Params:
  - **remote** = path to remote **(required)**
  - **withData** = true/false to delete cached data (chunks) as well _(optional, false by default)_

Use lower numbers for slower connections. If the chunk size is
changed, any downloaded chunks will be invalid and cache-chunk-path
will need to be cleared or unexpected EOF errors will occur.

Properties:

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     5Mi
- Examples:
    - "1M"
        - 1 MiB
    - "5M"
        - 5 MiB
    - "10M"
        - 10 MiB

#### --cache-info-age

How long to cache file structure information (directory listings, file size, times, etc.). 
If all write operations are done through the cache then you can safely make
this value very large as the cache store will also be updated in real time.

Properties:

- Config:      info_age
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_INFO_AGE
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     6h0m0s
- Examples:
    - "1h"
        - 1 hour
    - "24h"
        - 24 hours
    - "48h"
        - 48 hours

#### --cache-chunk-total-size

The total size that the chunks can take up on the local disk.

If the cache exceeds this value then it will start to delete the
oldest chunks until it goes under this value.

Properties:

- Config:      chunk_total_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_TOTAL_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     10Gi
- Examples:
    - "500M"
        - 500 MiB
    - "1G"
        - 1 GiB
    - "10G"
        - 10 GiB

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to cache (Cache a remote).

#### --cache-plex-token

The plex token for authentication - auto set normally.

Properties:

- Config:      plex_token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --cache-plex-insecure

Skip all certificate verification when connecting to the Plex server.

Properties:

- Config:      plex_insecure
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_INSECURE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --cache-db-path

Directory to store file structure metadata DB.

The remote name is used as the DB file name.

Properties:

- Config:      db_path
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_DB_PATH
- Type:        string
- Default:     "$HOME/.cache/rclone/cache-backend"

#### --cache-chunk-path

Directory to cache chunk files.

Path to where partial file data (chunks) are stored locally. The remote
name is appended to the final path.

This config follows the "--cache-db-path". If you specify a custom
location for "--cache-db-path" and don't specify one for "--cache-chunk-path"
then "--cache-chunk-path" will use the same path as "--cache-db-path".

Properties:

- Config:      chunk_path
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_PATH
- Type:        string
- Default:     "$HOME/.cache/rclone/cache-backend"

#### --cache-db-purge

Clear all the cached data for this remote on start.

Properties:

- Config:      db_purge
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_DB_PURGE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --cache-chunk-clean-interval

How often should the cache perform cleanups of the chunk storage.

The default value should be ok for most people. If you find that the
cache goes over "cache-chunk-total-size" too often then try to lower
this value to force it to perform cleanups more often.

Properties:

- Config:      chunk_clean_interval
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_CLEAN_INTERVAL
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --cache-read-retries

How many times to retry a read from a cache storage.

Since reading from a cache stream is independent from downloading file
data, readers can get to a point where there's no more data in the
cache.  Most of the times this can indicate a connectivity issue if
cache isn't able to provide file data anymore.

For really slow connections, increase this to a point where the stream is
able to provide data but your experience will be very stuttering.

Properties:

- Config:      read_retries
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_READ_RETRIES
- Type:        int
- Default:     10

#### --cache-workers

How many workers should run in parallel to download chunks.

Higher values will mean more parallel processing (better CPU needed)
and more concurrent requests on the cloud provider.  This impacts
several aspects like the cloud provider API limits, more stress on the
hardware that rclone runs on but it also means that streams will be
more fluid and data will be available much more faster to readers.

**Note**: If the optional Plex integration is enabled then this
setting will adapt to the type of reading performed and the value
specified here will be used as a maximum number of workers to use.

Properties:

- Config:      workers
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_WORKERS
- Type:        int
- Default:     4

#### --cache-chunk-no-memory

Disable the in-memory cache for storing chunks during streaming.

By default, cache will keep file data during streaming in RAM as well
to provide it to readers as fast as possible.

This transient data is evicted as soon as it is read and the number of
chunks stored doesn't exceed the number of workers. However, depending
on other settings like "cache-chunk-size" and "cache-workers" this footprint
can increase if there are parallel streams too (multiple files being read
at the same time).

If the hardware permits it, use this feature to provide an overall better
performance during streaming but it can also be disabled if RAM is not
available on the local machine.

Properties:

- Config:      chunk_no_memory
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_NO_MEMORY
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --cache-rps

Limits the number of requests per second to the source FS (-1 to disable).

This setting places a hard limit on the number of requests per second
that cache will be doing to the cloud provider remote and try to
respect that value by setting waits between reads.

If you find that you're getting banned or limited on the cloud
provider through cache and know that a smaller number of requests per
second will allow you to work with it then you can use this setting
for that.

A good balance of all the other settings should make this setting
useless but it is available to set for more special cases.

**NOTE**: This will limit the number of requests during streams but
other API calls to the cloud provider like directory listings will
still pass.

Properties:

- Config:      rps
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_RPS
- Type:        int
- Default:     -1

#### --cache-writes

Cache file data on writes through the FS.

If you need to read files immediately after you upload them through
cache you can enable this flag to have their data stored in the
cache store at the same time during upload.

Properties:

- Config:      writes
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_WRITES
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --cache-tmp-upload-path

Directory to keep temporary files until they are uploaded.

This is the path where cache will use as a temporary storage for new
files that need to be uploaded to the cloud provider.

Specifying a value will enable this feature. Without it, it is
completely disabled and files will be uploaded directly to the cloud
provider

Properties:

- Config:      tmp_upload_path
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_TMP_UPLOAD_PATH
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --cache-tmp-wait-time

How long should files be stored in local cache before being uploaded.

This is the duration that a file must wait in the temporary location
_cache-tmp-upload-path_ before it is selected for upload.

Note that only one file is uploaded at a time and it can take longer
to start the upload if a queue formed for this purpose.

Properties:

- Config:      tmp_wait_time
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_TMP_WAIT_TIME
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     15s

#### --cache-db-wait-time

How long to wait for the DB to be available - 0 is unlimited.

Only one process can have the DB open at any one time, so rclone waits
for this duration for the DB to become available before it gives an
error.

If you set it to 0 then it will wait forever.

Properties:

- Config:      db_wait_time
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_DB_WAIT_TIME
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1s

#### --cache-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

## Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the cache backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the [backend](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command).

#  Chunker

The `chunker` overlay transparently splits large files into smaller chunks
during upload to wrapped remote and transparently assembles them back
when the file is downloaded. This allows to effectively overcome size limits
imposed by storage providers.

## Configuration

To use it, first set up the underlying remote following the configuration
instructions for that remote. You can also use a local pathname instead of
a remote.

First check your chosen remote is working - we'll call it `remote:path` here.
Note that anything inside `remote:path` will be chunked and anything outside
won't. This means that if you are using a bucket-based remote (e.g. S3, B2, swift)
then you should probably put the bucket in the remote `s3:bucket`.

Now configure `chunker` using `rclone config`. We will call this one `overlay`
to separate it from the `remote` itself.

```

```

### Specifying the remote

In normal use, make sure the remote has a `:` in. If you specify the remote
without a `:` then rclone will use a local directory of that name.
So if you use a remote of `/path/to/secret/files` then rclone will
chunk stuff in that directory. If you use a remote of `name` then rclone
will put files in a directory called `name` in the current directory.


### Chunking

When rclone starts a file upload, chunker checks the file size. If it
doesn't exceed the configured chunk size, chunker will just pass the file
to the wrapped remote (however, see caveat below). If a file is large, chunker will transparently cut
data in pieces with temporary names and stream them one by one, on the fly.
Each data chunk will contain the specified number of bytes, except for the
last one which may have less data. If file size is unknown in advance
(this is called a streaming upload), chunker will internally create
a temporary copy, record its size and repeat the above process.

When upload completes, temporary chunk files are finally renamed.
This scheme guarantees that operations can be run in parallel and look
from outside as atomic.
A similar method with hidden temporary chunks is used for other operations
(copy/move/rename, etc.). If an operation fails, hidden chunks are normally
destroyed, and the target composite file stays intact.

When a composite file download is requested, chunker transparently
assembles it by concatenating data chunks in order. As the split is trivial
one could even manually concatenate data chunks together to obtain the
original content.

When the `list` rclone command scans a directory on wrapped remote,
the potential chunk files are accounted for, grouped and assembled into
composite directory entries. Any temporary chunks are hidden.

List and other commands can sometimes come across composite files with
missing or invalid chunks, e.g. shadowed by like-named directory or
another file. This usually means that wrapped file system has been directly
tampered with or damaged. If chunker detects a missing chunk it will
by default print warning, skip the whole incomplete group of chunks but
proceed with current command.
You can set the `--chunker-fail-hard` flag to have commands abort with
error message in such cases.

**Caveat**: As it is now, chunker will always create a temporary file in the 
backend and then rename it, even if the file is below the chunk threshold.
This will result in unnecessary API calls and can severely restrict throughput
when handling transfers primarily composed of small files on some backends (e.g. Box).
A workaround to this issue is to use chunker only for files above the chunk threshold
via `--min-size` and then perform a separate call without chunker on the remaining
files. 


#### Chunk names

The default chunk name format is `*.rclone_chunk.###`, hence by default
chunk names are `BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.001`,
`BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.002` etc. You can configure another name format
using the `name_format` configuration file option. The format uses asterisk
`*` as a placeholder for the base file name and one or more consecutive
hash characters `#` as a placeholder for sequential chunk number.
There must be one and only one asterisk. The number of consecutive hash
characters defines the minimum length of a string representing a chunk number.
If decimal chunk number has less digits than the number of hashes, it is
left-padded by zeros. If the decimal string is longer, it is left intact.
By default numbering starts from 1 but there is another option that allows
user to start from 0, e.g. for compatibility with legacy software.

For example, if name format is `big_*-##.part` and original file name is
`data.txt` and numbering starts from 0, then the first chunk will be named
`big_data.txt-00.part`, the 99th chunk will be `big_data.txt-98.part`
and the 302nd chunk will become `big_data.txt-301.part`.

Note that `list` assembles composite directory entries only when chunk names
match the configured format and treats non-conforming file names as normal
non-chunked files.

When using `norename` transactions, chunk names will additionally have a unique
file version suffix. For example, `BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.001_bp562k`.


### Metadata

Besides data chunks chunker will by default create metadata object for
a composite file. The object is named after the original file.
Chunker allows user to disable metadata completely (the `none` format).
Note that metadata is normally not created for files smaller than the
configured chunk size. This may change in future rclone releases.

#### Simple JSON metadata format

This is the default format. It supports hash sums and chunk validation
for composite files. Meta objects carry the following fields:

- `ver`     - version of format, currently `1`
- `size`    - total size of composite file
- `nchunks` - number of data chunks in file
- `md5`     - MD5 hashsum of composite file (if present)
- `sha1`    - SHA1 hashsum (if present)
- `txn`     - identifies current version of the file

There is no field for composite file name as it's simply equal to the name
of meta object on the wrapped remote. Please refer to respective sections
for details on hashsums and modified time handling.

#### No metadata

You can disable meta objects by setting the meta format option to `none`.
In this mode chunker will scan directory for all files that follow
configured chunk name format, group them by detecting chunks with the same
base name and show group names as virtual composite files.
This method is more prone to missing chunk errors (especially missing
last chunk) than format with metadata enabled.


### Hashsums

Chunker supports hashsums only when a compatible metadata is present.
Hence, if you choose metadata format of `none`, chunker will report hashsum
as `UNSUPPORTED`.

Please note that by default metadata is stored only for composite files.
If a file is smaller than configured chunk size, chunker will transparently
redirect hash requests to wrapped remote, so support depends on that.
You will see the empty string as a hashsum of requested type for small
files if the wrapped remote doesn't support it.

Many storage backends support MD5 and SHA1 hash types, so does chunker.
With chunker you can choose one or another but not both.
MD5 is set by default as the most supported type.
Since chunker keeps hashes for composite files and falls back to the
wrapped remote hash for non-chunked ones, we advise you to choose the same
hash type as supported by wrapped remote so that your file listings
look coherent.

If your storage backend does not support MD5 or SHA1 but you need consistent
file hashing, configure chunker with `md5all` or `sha1all`. These two modes
guarantee given hash for all files. If wrapped remote doesn't support it,
chunker will then add metadata to all files, even small. However, this can
double the amount of small files in storage and incur additional service charges.
You can even use chunker to force md5/sha1 support in any other remote
at expense of sidecar meta objects by setting e.g. `hash_type=sha1all`
to force hashsums and `chunk_size=1P` to effectively disable chunking.

Normally, when a file is copied to chunker controlled remote, chunker
will ask the file source for compatible file hash and revert to on-the-fly
calculation if none is found. This involves some CPU overhead but provides
a guarantee that given hashsum is available. Also, chunker will reject
a server-side copy or move operation if source and destination hashsum
types are different resulting in the extra network bandwidth, too.
In some rare cases this may be undesired, so chunker provides two optional
choices: `sha1quick` and `md5quick`. If the source does not support primary
hash type and the quick mode is enabled, chunker will try to fall back to
the secondary type. This will save CPU and bandwidth but can result in empty
hashsums at destination. Beware of consequences: the `sync` command will
revert (sometimes silently) to time/size comparison if compatible hashsums
between source and target are not found.


### Modification times

Chunker stores modification times using the wrapped remote so support
depends on that. For a small non-chunked file the chunker overlay simply
manipulates modification time of the wrapped remote file.
For a composite file with metadata chunker will get and set
modification time of the metadata object on the wrapped remote.
If file is chunked but metadata format is `none` then chunker will
use modification time of the first data chunk.


### Migrations

The idiomatic way to migrate to a different chunk size, hash type, transaction
style or chunk naming scheme is to:

- Collect all your chunked files under a directory and have your
  chunker remote point to it.
- Create another directory (most probably on the same cloud storage)
  and configure a new remote with desired metadata format,
  hash type, chunk naming etc.
- Now run `rclone sync --interactive oldchunks: newchunks:` and all your data
  will be transparently converted in transfer.
  This may take some time, yet chunker will try server-side
  copy if possible.
- After checking data integrity you may remove configuration section
  of the old remote.

If rclone gets killed during a long operation on a big composite file,
hidden temporary chunks may stay in the directory. They will not be
shown by the `list` command but will eat up your account quota.
Please note that the `deletefile` command deletes only active
chunks of a file. As a workaround, you can use remote of the wrapped
file system to see them.
An easy way to get rid of hidden garbage is to copy littered directory
somewhere using the chunker remote and purge the original directory.
The `copy` command will copy only active chunks while the `purge` will
remove everything including garbage.


### Caveats and Limitations

Chunker requires wrapped remote to support server-side `move` (or `copy` +
`delete`) operations, otherwise it will explicitly refuse to start.
This is because it internally renames temporary chunk files to their final
names when an operation completes successfully.

Chunker encodes chunk number in file name, so with default `name_format`
setting it adds 17 characters. Also chunker adds 7 characters of temporary
suffix during operations. Many file systems limit base file name without path
by 255 characters. Using rclone's crypt remote as a base file system limits
file name by 143 characters. Thus, maximum name length is 231 for most files
and 119 for chunker-over-crypt. A user in need can change name format to
e.g. `*.rcc##` and save 10 characters (provided at most 99 chunks per file).

Note that a move implemented using the copy-and-delete method may incur
double charging with some cloud storage providers.

Chunker will not automatically rename existing chunks when you run
`rclone config` on a live remote and change the chunk name format.
Beware that in result of this some files which have been treated as chunks
before the change can pop up in directory listings as normal files
and vice versa. The same warning holds for the chunk size.
If you desperately need to change critical chunking settings, you should
run data migration as described above.

If wrapped remote is case insensitive, the chunker overlay will inherit
that property (so you can't have a file called "Hello.doc" and "hello.doc"
in the same directory).

Chunker included in rclone releases up to `v1.54` can sometimes fail to
detect metadata produced by recent versions of rclone. We recommend users
to keep rclone up-to-date to avoid data corruption.

Changing `transactions` is dangerous and requires explicit migration.

        - Leave temporary file names and write transaction ID to metadata file.
        - Metadata is required for no rename transactions (meta format cannot be "none").
        - If you are using norename transactions you should be careful not to downgrade Rclone
        - as older versions of Rclone don't support this transaction style and will misinterpret
        - files manipulated by norename transactions.
        - This method is EXPERIMENTAL, don't use on production systems.
    - "auto"

#  Citrix ShareFile

[Citrix ShareFile](https://sharefile.com) is a secure file sharing and transfer service aimed as business.

## Configuration

The initial setup for Citrix ShareFile involves getting a token from
Citrix ShareFile which you can in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
XX / Citrix Sharefile
   \ "sharefile"
Storage> sharefile
** See help for sharefile backend at: https://rclone.org/sharefile/ **

ID of the root folder

Leave blank to access "Personal Folders".  You can use one of the
standard values here or any folder ID (long hex number ID).
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Access the Personal Folders. (Default)
   \ ""
 2 / Access the Favorites folder.
   \ "favorites"
 3 / Access all the shared folders.
   \ "allshared"
 4 / Access all the individual connectors.
   \ "connectors"
 5 / Access the home, favorites, and shared folders as well as the connectors.
   \ "top"
root_folder_id> 
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> n
Remote config
Use web browser to automatically authenticate rclone with remote?
 * Say Y if the machine running rclone has a web browser you can use
 * Say N if running rclone on a (remote) machine without web browser access
If not sure try Y. If Y failed, try N.
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth?state=XXX
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: sharefile
- endpoint: https://XXX.sharefile.com
- token: {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"2019-09-30T19:41:45.878561877+01:00"}
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Citrix ShareFile. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.  This
is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require you to unblock
it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your ShareFile

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your ShareFile

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an ShareFile directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

### Modification times and hashes

ShareFile allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.  These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

ShareFile supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the `--checksum`
flag.

### Transfers

For files above 128 MiB rclone will use a chunked transfer.  Rclone will
upload up to `--transfers` chunks at the same time (shared among all
the multipart uploads).  Chunks are buffered in memory and are
normally 64 MiB so increasing `--transfers` will increase memory use.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \\        | 0x5C  | ＼           |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊           |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜           |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞           |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？           |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：           |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜           |
| "         | 0x22  | ＂           |

File names can also not start or end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the first or last character in the
name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |
| .         | 0x2E  | ．           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

## Limitations

Note that ShareFile is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

ShareFile only supports filenames up to 256 characters in length.

`rclone about` is not supported by the Citrix ShareFile backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) and [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Crypt

Rclone `crypt` remotes encrypt and decrypt other remotes.

A remote of type `crypt` does not access a [storage system](https://rclone.org/overview/)
directly, but instead wraps another remote, which in turn accesses
the storage system. This is similar to how [alias](https://rclone.org/alias/),
[union](https://rclone.org/union/), [chunker](https://rclone.org/chunker/)
and a few others work. It makes the usage very flexible, as you can
add a layer, in this case an encryption layer, on top of any other
backend, even in multiple layers. Rclone's functionality
can be used as with any other remote, for example you can
[mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) a crypt remote.

Accessing a storage system through a crypt remote realizes client-side
encryption, which makes it safe to keep your data in a location you do
not trust will not get compromised.
When working against the `crypt` remote, rclone will automatically
encrypt (before uploading) and decrypt (after downloading) on your local
system as needed on the fly, leaving the data encrypted at rest in the
wrapped remote. If you access the storage system using an application
other than rclone, or access the wrapped remote directly using rclone,
there will not be any encryption/decryption: Downloading existing content
will just give you the encrypted (scrambled) format, and anything you
upload will *not* become encrypted.

The encryption is a secret-key encryption (also called symmetric key encryption)
algorithm, where a password (or pass phrase) is used to generate real encryption key.
The password can be supplied by user, or you may chose to let rclone
generate one. It will be stored in the configuration file, in a lightly obscured form.
If you are in an environment where you are not able to keep your configuration
secured, you should add
[configuration encryption](https://rclone.org/docs/#configuration-encryption)
as protection. As long as you have this configuration file, you will be able to
decrypt your data. Without the configuration file, as long as you remember
the password (or keep it in a safe place), you can re-create the configuration
and gain access to the existing data. You may also configure a corresponding
remote in a different installation to access the same data.
See below for guidance to [changing password](#changing-password).

Encryption uses [cryptographic salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)),
to permute the encryption key so that the same string may be encrypted in
different ways. When configuring the crypt remote it is optional to enter a salt,
or to let rclone generate a unique salt. If omitted, rclone uses a built-in unique string.
Normally in cryptography, the salt is stored together with the encrypted content,
and do not have to be memorized by the user. This is not the case in rclone,
because rclone does not store any additional information on the remotes. Use of
custom salt is effectively a second password that must be memorized.

[File content](#file-encryption) encryption is performed using
[NaCl SecretBox](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox),
based on XSalsa20 cipher and Poly1305 for integrity.
[Names](#name-encryption) (file- and directory names) are also encrypted
by default, but this has some implications and is therefore
possible to be turned off.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `secret`.

To use `crypt`, first set up the underlying remote. Follow the
`rclone config` instructions for the specific backend.

Before configuring the crypt remote, check the underlying remote is
working. In this example the underlying remote is called `remote`.
We will configure a path `path` within this remote to contain the
encrypted content. Anything inside `remote:path` will be encrypted
and anything outside will not.

Configure `crypt` using `rclone config`. In this example the `crypt`
remote is called `secret`, to differentiate it from the underlying
`remote`.

When you are done you can use the crypt remote named `secret` just
as you would with any other remote, e.g. `rclone copy D:\docs secret:\docs`,
and rclone will encrypt and decrypt as needed on the fly.
If you access the wrapped remote `remote:path` directly you will bypass
the encryption, and anything you read will be in encrypted form, and
anything you write will be unencrypted. To avoid issues it is best to
configure a dedicated path for encrypted content, and access it
exclusively through a crypt remote.

```

**Important** The crypt password stored in `rclone.conf` is lightly
obscured. That only protects it from cursory inspection. It is not
secure unless [configuration encryption](https://rclone.org/docs/#configuration-encryption) of `rclone.conf` is specified.

A long passphrase is recommended, or `rclone config` can generate a
random one.

The obscured password is created using AES-CTR with a static key. The
IV (nonce) is stored verbatim at the beginning of the obscured password. This
static key is shared between all versions of rclone.

If you reconfigure rclone with the same passwords/passphrases
elsewhere it will be compatible, but the obscured version will be different
due to the different salt.

Rclone does not encrypt

  * file length - this can be calculated within 16 bytes
  * modification time - used for syncing

### Specifying the remote

When configuring the remote to encrypt/decrypt, you may specify any
string that rclone accepts as a source/destination of other commands.

The primary use case is to specify the path into an already configured
remote (e.g. `remote:path/to/dir` or `remote:bucket`), such that
data in a remote untrusted location can be stored encrypted.

You may also specify a local filesystem path, such as
`/path/to/dir` on Linux, `C:\path\to\dir` on Windows. By creating
a crypt remote pointing to such a local filesystem path, you can
use rclone as a utility for pure local file encryption, for example
to keep encrypted files on a removable USB drive.

**Note**: A string which do not contain a `:` will by rclone be treated
as a relative path in the local filesystem. For example, if you enter
the name `remote` without the trailing `:`, it will be treated as
a subdirectory of the current directory with name "remote".

If a path `remote:path/to/dir` is specified, rclone stores encrypted
files in `path/to/dir` on the remote. With file name encryption, files
saved to `secret:subdir/subfile` are stored in the unencrypted path
`path/to/dir` but the `subdir/subpath` element is encrypted.

The path you specify does not have to exist, rclone will create
it when needed.

If you intend to use the wrapped remote both directly for keeping
unencrypted content, as well as through a crypt remote for encrypted
content, it is recommended to point the crypt remote to a separate
directory within the wrapped remote. If you use a bucket-based storage
system (e.g. Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2) it is generally
advisable to wrap the crypt remote around a specific bucket (`s3:bucket`).
If wrapping around the entire root of the storage (`s3:`), and use the
optional file name encryption, rclone will encrypt the bucket name.

### Changing password

Should the password, or the configuration file containing a lightly obscured
form of the password, be compromised, you need to re-encrypt your data with
a new password. Since rclone uses secret-key encryption, where the encryption
key is generated directly from the password kept on the client, it is not
possible to change the password/key of already encrypted content. Just changing
the password configured for an existing crypt remote means you will no longer
able to decrypt any of the previously encrypted content. The only possibility
is to re-upload everything via a crypt remote configured with your new password.

Depending on the size of your data, your bandwidth, storage quota etc, there are
different approaches you can take:
- If you have everything in a different location, for example on your local system,
you could remove all of the prior encrypted files, change the password for your
configured crypt remote (or delete and re-create the crypt configuration),
and then re-upload everything from the alternative location.
- If you have enough space on the storage system you can create a new crypt
remote pointing to a separate directory on the same backend, and then use
rclone to copy everything from the original crypt remote to the new,
effectively decrypting everything on the fly using the old password and
re-encrypting using the new password. When done, delete the original crypt
remote directory and finally the rclone crypt configuration with the old password.
All data will be streamed from the storage system and back, so you will
get half the bandwidth and be charged twice if you have upload and download quota
on the storage system.

**Note**: A security problem related to the random password generator
was fixed in rclone version 1.53.3 (released 2020-11-19). Passwords generated
by rclone config in version 1.49.0 (released 2019-08-26) to 1.53.2
(released 2020-10-26) are not considered secure and should be changed.
If you made up your own password, or used rclone version older than 1.49.0 or
newer than 1.53.2 to generate it, you are *not* affected by this issue.
See [issue #4783](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4783) for more
details, and a tool you can use to check if you are affected.

### Example

Create the following file structure using "standard" file name
encryption.

```
plaintext/
├── file0.txt
├── file1.txt
└── subdir
    ├── file2.txt
    ├── file3.txt
    └── subsubdir
        └── file4.txt
```

Copy these to the remote, and list them

```
$ rclone -q copy plaintext secret:
$ rclone -q ls secret:
        7 file1.txt
        6 file0.txt
        8 subdir/file2.txt
       10 subdir/subsubdir/file4.txt
        9 subdir/file3.txt
```

The crypt remote looks like

```
$ rclone -q ls remote:path
       55 hagjclgavj2mbiqm6u6cnjjqcg
       54 v05749mltvv1tf4onltun46gls
       57 86vhrsv86mpbtd3a0akjuqslj8/dlj7fkq4kdq72emafg7a7s41uo
       58 86vhrsv86mpbtd3a0akjuqslj8/7uu829995du6o42n32otfhjqp4/b9pausrfansjth5ob3jkdqd4lc
       56 86vhrsv86mpbtd3a0akjuqslj8/8njh1sk437gttmep3p70g81aps
```

The directory structure is preserved

```
$ rclone -q ls secret:subdir
        8 file2.txt
        9 file3.txt
       10 subsubdir/file4.txt
```

Without file name encryption `.bin` extensions are added to underlying
names. This prevents the cloud provider attempting to interpret file
content.

```
$ rclone -q ls remote:path
       54 file0.txt.bin
       57 subdir/file3.txt.bin
       56 subdir/file2.txt.bin
       58 subdir/subsubdir/file4.txt.bin
       55 file1.txt.bin
```

### File name encryption modes

Off

  * doesn't hide file names or directory structure
  * allows for longer file names (~246 characters)
  * can use sub paths and copy single files

Standard

  * file names encrypted
  * file names can't be as long (~143 characters)
  * can use sub paths and copy single files
  * directory structure visible
  * identical files names will have identical uploaded names
  * can use shortcuts to shorten the directory recursion

Obfuscation

This is a simple "rotate" of the filename, with each file having a rot
distance based on the filename. Rclone stores the distance at the
beginning of the filename. A file called "hello" may become "53.jgnnq".

Obfuscation is not a strong encryption of filenames, but hinders
automated scanning tools picking up on filename patterns. It is an
intermediate between "off" and "standard" which allows for longer path
segment names.

There is a possibility with some unicode based filenames that the
obfuscation is weak and may map lower case characters to upper case
equivalents.

Obfuscation cannot be relied upon for strong protection.

  * file names very lightly obfuscated
  * file names can be longer than standard encryption
  * can use sub paths and copy single files
  * directory structure visible
  * identical files names will have identical uploaded names

Cloud storage systems have limits on file name length and
total path length which rclone is more likely to breach using
"Standard" file name encryption.  Where file names are 143 or fewer
characters in length issues should not be encountered, irrespective of
cloud storage provider.

An experimental advanced option `filename_encoding` is now provided to
address this problem to a certain degree.
For cloud storage systems with case sensitive file names (e.g. Google Drive),
`base64` can be used to reduce file name length. 
For cloud storage systems using UTF-16 to store file names internally
(e.g. OneDrive, Dropbox, Box), `base32768` can be used to drastically reduce
file name length. 

An alternative, future rclone file name encryption mode may tolerate
backend provider path length limits.

### Directory name encryption

Crypt offers the option of encrypting dir names or leaving them intact.
There are two options:

True

Encrypts the whole file path including directory names
Example:
`1/12/123.txt` is encrypted to
`p0e52nreeaj0a5ea7s64m4j72s/l42g6771hnv3an9cgc8cr2n1ng/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0`

False

Only encrypts file names, skips directory names
Example:
`1/12/123.txt` is encrypted to
`1/12/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0`


### Modification times and hashes

Crypt stores modification times using the underlying remote so support
depends on that.

Hashes are not stored for crypt. However the data integrity is
protected by an extremely strong crypto authenticator.

Use the `rclone cryptcheck` command to check the
integrity of an encrypted remote instead of `rclone check` which can't
check the checksums properly.


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to crypt (Encrypt/Decrypt a remote).

#### --crypt-remote

Option to either encrypt directory names or leave them intact.

NB If filename_encryption is "off" then this option will do nothing.

Properties:

- Config:      directory_name_encryption
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_DIRECTORY_NAME_ENCRYPTION
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true
- Examples:
    - "true"
        - Encrypt directory names.
    - "false"
        - Don't encrypt directory names, leave them intact.

#### --crypt-password

Password or pass phrase for encryption.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

Properties:

- Config:      password
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_PASSWORD
- Type:        string
- Required:    true

#### --crypt-password2

Password or pass phrase for salt.

Optional but recommended.
Should be different to the previous password.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

Properties:

- Config:      password2
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_PASSWORD2
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to crypt (Encrypt/Decrypt a remote).

#### --crypt-server-side-across-configs

Deprecated: use --server-side-across-configs instead.

Allow server-side operations (e.g. copy) to work across different crypt configs.

Normally this option is not what you want, but if you have two crypts
pointing to the same backend you can use it.

This can be used, for example, to change file name encryption type
without re-uploading all the data. Just make two crypt backends
pointing to two different directories with the single changed
parameter and use rclone move to move the files between the crypt
remotes.

Properties:

- Config:      server_side_across_configs
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_SERVER_SIDE_ACROSS_CONFIGS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --crypt-show-mapping

For all files listed show how the names encrypt.

If this flag is set then for each file that the remote is asked to
list, it will log (at level INFO) a line stating the decrypted file
name and the encrypted file name.

This is so you can work out which encrypted names are which decrypted
names just in case you need to do something with the encrypted file
names, or for debugging purposes.

Properties:

- Config:      show_mapping
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_SHOW_MAPPING
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --crypt-no-data-encryption

Option to either encrypt file data or leave it unencrypted.

Properties:

- Config:      no_data_encryption
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_NO_DATA_ENCRYPTION
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false
- Examples:
    - "true"
        - Don't encrypt file data, leave it unencrypted.
    - "false"
        - Encrypt file data.

#### --crypt-pass-bad-blocks

If set this will pass bad blocks through as all 0.

This should not be set in normal operation, it should only be set if
trying to recover an encrypted file with errors and it is desired to
recover as much of the file as possible.

Properties:

- Config:      pass_bad_blocks
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_PASS_BAD_BLOCKS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --crypt-strict-names

If set, this will raise an error when crypt comes across a filename that can't be decrypted.

(By default, rclone will just log a NOTICE and continue as normal.)
This can happen if encrypted and unencrypted files are stored in the same
directory (which is not recommended.) It may also indicate a more serious
problem that should be investigated.

Properties:

- Config:      strict_names
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_STRICT_NAMES
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --crypt-filename-encoding

How to encode the encrypted filename to text string.

This option could help with shortening the encrypted filename. The 
suitable option would depend on the way your remote count the filename
length and if it's case sensitive.

Properties:

- Config:      filename_encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_FILENAME_ENCODING
- Type:        string
- Default:     "base32"
- Examples:
    - "base32"
        - Encode using base32. Suitable for all remote.
    - "base64"
        - Encode using base64. Suitable for case sensitive remote.
    - "base32768"
        - Encode using base32768. Suitable if your remote counts UTF-16 or
        - Unicode codepoint instead of UTF-8 byte length. (Eg. Onedrive, Dropbox)

#### --crypt-suffix

If this is set it will override the default suffix of ".bin".

Setting suffix to "none" will result in an empty suffix. This may be useful 
when the path length is critical.

Properties:

- Config:      suffix
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_SUFFIX
- Type:        string
- Default:     ".bin"

#### --crypt-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

### Metadata

Any metadata supported by the underlying remote is read and written.

See the [metadata](https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata) docs for more info.

## Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the crypt backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the [backend](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command).

### encode

Encode the given filename(s)

    rclone backend encode remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This encodes the filenames given as arguments returning a list of
strings of the encoded results.

Usage Example:

    rclone backend encode crypt: file1 [file2...]
    rclone rc backend/command command=encode fs=crypt: file1 [file2...]


### decode

Decode the given filename(s)

    rclone backend decode remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This decodes the filenames given as arguments returning a list of
strings of the decoded results. It will return an error if any of the
inputs are invalid.

Usage Example:

    rclone backend decode crypt: encryptedfile1 [encryptedfile2...]
    rclone rc backend/command command=decode fs=crypt: encryptedfile1 [encryptedfile2...]




## Backing up an encrypted remote

If you wish to backup an encrypted remote, it is recommended that you use
`rclone sync` on the encrypted files, and make sure the passwords are
the same in the new encrypted remote.

This will have the following advantages

  * `rclone sync` will check the checksums while copying
  * you can use `rclone check` between the encrypted remotes
  * you don't decrypt and encrypt unnecessarily

For example, let's say you have your original remote at `remote:` with
the encrypted version at `eremote:` with path `remote:crypt`.  You
would then set up the new remote `remote2:` and then the encrypted
version `eremote2:` with path `remote2:crypt` using the same passwords
as `eremote:`.

To sync the two remotes you would do

    rclone sync --interactive remote:crypt remote2:crypt

And to check the integrity you would do

    rclone check remote:crypt remote2:crypt

## File formats

### File encryption

Files are encrypted 1:1 source file to destination object.  The file
has a header and is divided into chunks.

#### Header

  * 8 bytes magic string `RCLONE\x00\x00`
  * 24 bytes Nonce (IV)

The initial nonce is generated from the operating systems crypto
strong random number generator.  The nonce is incremented for each
chunk read making sure each nonce is unique for each block written.
The chance of a nonce being reused is minuscule.  If you wrote an
exabyte of data (10¹⁸ bytes) you would have a probability of
approximately 2×10⁻³² of re-using a nonce.

#### Chunk

Each chunk will contain 64 KiB of data, except for the last one which
may have less data. The data chunk is in standard NaCl SecretBox
format. SecretBox uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and
authenticate messages.

Each chunk contains:

  * 16 Bytes of Poly1305 authenticator
  * 1 - 65536 bytes XSalsa20 encrypted data

64k chunk size was chosen as the best performing chunk size (the
authenticator takes too much time below this and the performance drops
off due to cache effects above this).  Note that these chunks are
buffered in memory so they can't be too big.

This uses a 32 byte (256 bit key) key derived from the user password.

#### Examples

1 byte file will encrypt to

  * 32 bytes header
  * 17 bytes data chunk

49 bytes total

1 MiB (1048576 bytes) file will encrypt to

  * 32 bytes header
  * 16 chunks of 65568 bytes

1049120 bytes total (a 0.05% overhead). This is the overhead for big
files.

### Name encryption

File names are encrypted segment by segment - the path is broken up
into `/` separated strings and these are encrypted individually.

File segments are padded using PKCS#7 to a multiple of 16 bytes
before encryption.

They are then encrypted with EME using AES with 256 bit key. EME
(ECB-Mix-ECB) is a wide-block encryption mode presented in the 2003
paper "A Parallelizable Enciphering Mode" by Halevi and Rogaway.

This makes for deterministic encryption which is what we want - the
same filename must encrypt to the same thing otherwise we can't find
it on the cloud storage system.

This means that

  * filenames with the same name will encrypt the same
  * filenames which start the same won't have a common prefix

This uses a 32 byte key (256 bits) and a 16 byte (128 bits) IV both of
which are derived from the user password.

After encryption they are written out using a modified version of
standard `base32` encoding as described in RFC4648.  The standard
encoding is modified in two ways:

  * it becomes lower case (no-one likes upper case filenames!)
  * we strip the padding character `=`

`base32` is used rather than the more efficient `base64` so rclone can be
used on case insensitive remotes (e.g. Windows, Box, Dropbox, Onedrive etc).

### Key derivation

Rclone uses `scrypt` with parameters `N=16384, r=8, p=1` with an
optional user supplied salt (password2) to derive the 32+32+16 = 80
bytes of key material required.  If the user doesn't supply a salt
then rclone uses an internal one.

`scrypt` makes it impractical to mount a dictionary attack on rclone
encrypted data.  For full protection against this you should always use
a salt.

#  Compress

## Warning

This remote is currently **experimental**. Things may break and data may be lost. Anything you do with this remote is
at your own risk. Please understand the risks associated with using experimental code and don't use this remote in
critical applications.

The `Compress` remote adds compression to another remote. It is best used with remotes containing
many large compressible files.

## Configuration

To use this remote, all you need to do is specify another remote and a compression mode to use:

```
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
remote_to_press      sometype

e) Edit existing remote
$ rclone config
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> n
name> compress
...
 8 / Compress a remote
   \ "compress"
...
Storage> compress
** See help for compress backend at: https://rclone.org/compress/ **

Remote to compress.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
remote> remote_to_press:subdir 
Compression mode.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("gzip").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Gzip compression balanced for speed and compression strength.
   \ "gzip"
compression_mode> gzip
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
Remote config
--------------------
[compress]
type = compress
remote = remote_to_press:subdir
compression_mode = gzip
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

### Compression Modes

Currently only gzip compression is supported. It provides a decent balance between speed and size and is well
supported by other applications. Compression strength can further be configured via an advanced setting where 0 is no
compression and 9 is strongest compression.

### File types

If you open a remote wrapped by compress, you will see that there are many files with an extension corresponding to
the compression algorithm you chose. These files are standard files that can be opened by various archive programs, 
but they have some hidden metadata that allows them to be used by rclone.
While you may download and decompress these files at will, do **not** manually delete or rename files. Files without
correct metadata files will not be recognized by rclone.

### File names

The compressed files will be named `*.###########.gz` where `*` is the base file and the `#` part is base64 encoded 
size of the uncompressed file. The file names should not be changed by anything other than the rclone compression backend.


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to compress (Compress a remote).

#### --compress-remote

Remote to compress.

Properties:

- Config:      remote
- Env Var:     RCLONE_COMPRESS_REMOTE
- Type:        string
- Required:    true

#### --compress-mode

Compression mode.

Properties:

- Config:      mode
- Env Var:     RCLONE_COMPRESS_MODE
- Type:        string
- Default:     "gzip"
- Examples:
    - "gzip"
        - Standard gzip compression with fastest parameters.

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to compress (Compress a remote).

#### --compress-level

GZIP compression level (-2 to 9).

Generally -1 (default, equivalent to 5) is recommended.
Levels 1 to 9 increase compression at the cost of speed. Going past 6 
generally offers very little return.

Level -2 uses Huffman encoding only. Only use if you know what you
are doing.
Level 0 turns off compression.

Properties:

- Config:      level
- Env Var:     RCLONE_COMPRESS_LEVEL
- Type:        int
- Default:     -1

#### --compress-ram-cache-limit

Some remotes don't allow the upload of files with unknown size.
In this case the compressed file will need to be cached to determine
it's size.

Files smaller than this limit will be cached in RAM, files larger than 
this limit will be cached on disk.

Properties:

- Config:      ram_cache_limit
- Env Var:     RCLONE_COMPRESS_RAM_CACHE_LIMIT
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     20Mi

#### --compress-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_COMPRESS_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

### Metadata

Any metadata supported by the underlying remote is read and written.

See the [metadata](https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata) docs for more info.



#  Combine

The `combine` backend joins remotes together into a single directory
tree.

For example you might have a remote for images on one provider:

```
$ rclone tree s3:imagesbucket
/
├── image1.jpg
└── image2.jpg
```

And a remote for files on another:

```
$ rclone tree drive:important/files
/
├── file1.txt
└── file2.txt
```

The `combine` backend can join these together into a synthetic
directory structure like this:

```
$ rclone tree combined:
/
├── files
│   ├── file1.txt
│   └── file2.txt
└── images
    ├── image1.jpg
    └── image2.jpg
```

You'd do this by specifying an `upstreams` parameter in the config
like this

    upstreams = images=s3:imagesbucket files=drive:important/files

During the initial setup with `rclone config` you will specify the
upstreams remotes as a space separated list. The upstream remotes can
either be a local paths or other remotes.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a combine called `remote` for the
example above. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Option Storage.
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.
...
XX / Combine several remotes into one
   \ (combine)
...
Storage> combine
Option upstreams.
Upstreams for combining
These should be in the form
    dir=remote:path dir2=remote2:path
Where before the = is specified the root directory and after is the remote to
put there.
Embedded spaces can be added using quotes
    "dir=remote:path with space" "dir2=remote2:path with space"
Enter a fs.SpaceSepList value.
upstreams> images=s3:imagesbucket files=drive:important/files
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: combine
- upstreams: images=s3:imagesbucket files=drive:important/files
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

### Configuring for Google Drive Shared Drives

Rclone has a convenience feature for making a combine backend for all
the shared drives you have access to.

Assuming your main (non shared drive) Google drive remote is called
`drive:` you would run

    rclone backend -o config drives drive:

This would produce something like this:

    [My Drive]
    type = alias
    remote = drive,team_drive=0ABCDEF-01234567890,root_folder_id=:

    [Test Drive]
    type = alias
    remote = drive,team_drive=0ABCDEFabcdefghijkl,root_folder_id=:

    [AllDrives]
    type = combine
    upstreams = "My Drive=My Drive:" "Test Drive=Test Drive:"

If you then add that config to your config file (find it with `rclone
config file`) then you can access all the shared drives in one place
with the `AllDrives:` remote.

See [the Google Drive docs](https://rclone.org/drive/#drives) for full info.


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to combine (Combine several remotes into one).

#### --combine-upstreams

Upstreams for combining

These should be in the form

    dir=remote:path dir2=remote2:path

Where before the = is specified the root directory and after is the remote to
put there.

Embedded spaces can be added using quotes

    "dir=remote:path with space" "dir2=remote2:path with space"



Properties:

- Config:      upstreams
- Env Var:     RCLONE_COMBINE_UPSTREAMS
- Type:        SpaceSepList
- Default:     

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to combine (Combine several remotes into one).

#### --combine-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_COMBINE_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

### Metadata

Any metadata supported by the underlying remote is read and written.

See the [metadata](https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata) docs for more info.



#  Dropbox

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Dropbox paths may be as deep as required, e.g.
`remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for dropbox involves getting a token from Dropbox
which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
q) Quit config
e/n/d/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Dropbox
   \ "dropbox"
[snip]
Storage> dropbox
Dropbox App Key - leave blank normally.
app_key>
Dropbox App Secret - leave blank normally.
app_secret>
Remote config
Please visit:
https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/authorize?client_id=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&response_type=code
Enter the code: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_XXXXXXXXXX
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: dropbox
- app_key:
- app_secret:
- token: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_XXXX_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Dropbox. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and it
may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your dropbox

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your dropbox

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a dropbox directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Dropbox for business

Rclone supports Dropbox for business and Team Folders.

When using Dropbox for business `remote:` and `remote:path/to/file`
will refer to your personal folder.

If you wish to see Team Folders you must use a leading `/` in the
path, so `rclone lsd remote:/` will refer to the root and show you all
Team Folders and your User Folder.

You can then use team folders like this `remote:/TeamFolder` and
`remote:/TeamFolder/path/to/file`.

A leading `/` for a Dropbox personal account will do nothing, but it
will take an extra HTTP transaction so it should be avoided.

### Modification times and hashes

Dropbox supports modified times, but the only way to set a
modification time is to re-upload the file.

This means that if you uploaded your data with an older version of
rclone which didn't support the v2 API and modified times, rclone will
decide to upload all your old data to fix the modification times.  If
you don't want this to happen use `--size-only` or `--checksum` flag
to stop it.

Dropbox supports [its own hash
type](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/content-hash) which
is checked for all transfers.

### Restricted filename characters

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／           |
| DEL       | 0x7F  | ␡           |
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |

File names can also not end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Batch mode uploads {#batch-mode}

Using batch mode uploads is very important for performance when using
the Dropbox API. See [the dropbox performance guide](https://developers.dropbox.com/dbx-performance-guide)
for more info.

There are 3 modes rclone can use for uploads.

#### --dropbox-batch-mode off

In this mode rclone will not use upload batching. This was the default
before rclone v1.55. It has the disadvantage that it is very likely to
encounter `too_many_requests` errors like this

    NOTICE: too_many_requests/.: Too many requests or write operations. Trying again in 15 seconds.

When rclone receives these it has to wait for 15s or sometimes 300s
before continuing which really slows down transfers.

This will happen especially if `--transfers` is large, so this mode
isn't recommended except for compatibility or investigating problems.

#### --dropbox-batch-mode sync

In this mode rclone will batch up uploads to the size specified by
`--dropbox-batch-size` and commit them together.

Using this mode means you can use a much higher `--transfers`
parameter (32 or 64 works fine) without receiving `too_many_requests`
errors.

This mode ensures full data integrity.

Note that there may be a pause when quitting rclone while rclone
finishes up the last batch using this mode.

#### --dropbox-batch-mode async

In this mode rclone will batch up uploads to the size specified by
`--dropbox-batch-size` and commit them together.

However it will not wait for the status of the batch to be returned to
the caller. This means rclone can use a much bigger batch size (much
bigger than `--transfers`), at the cost of not being able to check the
status of the upload.

This provides the maximum possible upload speed especially with lots
of small files, however rclone can't check the file got uploaded
properly using this mode.

If you are using this mode then using "rclone check" after the
transfer completes is recommended. Or you could do an initial transfer
with `--dropbox-batch-mode async` then do a final transfer with
`--dropbox-batch-mode sync` (the default).

Note that there may be a pause when quitting rclone while rclone
finishes up the last batch using this mode.

Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of this size.

Note that chunks are buffered in memory (one at a time) so rclone can
deal with retries.  Setting this larger will increase the speed
slightly (at most 10% for 128 MiB in tests) at the cost of using more
memory.  It can be set smaller if you are tight on memory.

Properties:

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     48Mi

#### --dropbox-impersonate

Impersonate this user when using a business account.

Note that if you want to use impersonate, you should make sure this
flag is set when running "rclone config" as this will cause rclone to
request the "members.read" scope which it won't normally. This is
needed to lookup a members email address into the internal ID that
dropbox uses in the API.

Using the "members.read" scope will require a Dropbox Team Admin
to approve during the OAuth flow.

You will have to use your own App (setting your own client_id and
client_secret) to use this option as currently rclone's default set of
permissions doesn't include "members.read". This can be added once
v1.55 or later is in use everywhere.


Properties:

- Config:      impersonate
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_IMPERSONATE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --dropbox-shared-files

Instructs rclone to work on individual shared files.

In this mode rclone's features are extremely limited - only list (ls, lsl, etc.) 
operations and read operations (e.g. downloading) are supported in this mode.
All other operations will be disabled.

Properties:

- Config:      shared_files
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_SHARED_FILES
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --dropbox-shared-folders

Instructs rclone to work on shared folders.
			
When this flag is used with no path only the List operation is supported and 
all available shared folders will be listed. If you specify a path the first part 
will be interpreted as the name of shared folder. Rclone will then try to mount this 
shared to the root namespace. On success shared folder rclone proceeds normally. 
The shared folder is now pretty much a normal folder and all normal operations 
are supported. 

Note that we don't unmount the shared folder afterwards so the 
--dropbox-shared-folders can be omitted after the first use of a particular 
shared folder.

See also --dropbox-root-namespace for an alternative way to work with shared
folders.

Properties:

- Config:      shared_folders
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_SHARED_FOLDERS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --dropbox-pacer-min-sleep

Minimum time to sleep between API calls.

Properties:

- Config:      pacer_min_sleep
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_PACER_MIN_SLEEP
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     10ms

#### --dropbox-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,BackSlash,Del,RightSpace,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --dropbox-root-namespace

Specify a different Dropbox namespace ID to use as the root for all paths.

Properties:

- Config:      root_namespace
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_ROOT_NAMESPACE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --dropbox-batch-mode

Upload file batching sync|async|off.

This sets the batch mode used by rclone.

For full info see [the main docs](https://rclone.org/dropbox/#batch-mode)

This has 3 possible values

- off - no batching
- sync - batch uploads and check completion (default)
- async - batch upload and don't check completion

Rclone will close any outstanding batches when it exits which may make
a delay on quit.


Properties:

- Config:      batch_mode
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_MODE
- Type:        string
- Default:     "sync"

#### --dropbox-batch-size

Max number of files in upload batch.

This sets the batch size of files to upload. It has to be less than 1000.

By default this is 0 which means rclone will calculate the batch size
depending on the setting of batch_mode.

- batch_mode: async - default batch_size is 100
- batch_mode: sync - default batch_size is the same as --transfers
- batch_mode: off - not in use

Rclone will close any outstanding batches when it exits which may make
a delay on quit.

Setting this is a great idea if you are uploading lots of small files
as it will make them a lot quicker. You can use --transfers 32 to
maximise throughput.


Properties:

- Config:      batch_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_SIZE
- Type:        int
- Default:     0

#### --dropbox-batch-timeout

Max time to allow an idle upload batch before uploading.

If an upload batch is idle for more than this long then it will be
uploaded.

The default for this is 0 which means rclone will choose a sensible
default based on the batch_mode in use.

- batch_mode: async - default batch_timeout is 10s
- batch_mode: sync - default batch_timeout is 500ms
- batch_mode: off - not in use


Properties:

- Config:      batch_timeout
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_TIMEOUT
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     0s

#### --dropbox-batch-commit-timeout

Max time to wait for a batch to finish committing

Properties:

- Config:      batch_commit_timeout
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_COMMIT_TIMEOUT
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     10m0s

#### --dropbox-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false



## Limitations

Note that Dropbox is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are some file names such as `thumbs.db` which Dropbox can't
store.  There is a full list of them in the ["Ignored Files" section
of this document](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/145).  Rclone will
issue an error message `File name disallowed - not uploading` if it
attempts to upload one of those file names, but the sync won't fail.

Some errors may occur if you try to sync copyright-protected files
because Dropbox has its own [copyright detector](https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/30/how-dropbox-knows-when-youre-sharing-copyrighted-stuff-without-actually-looking-at-your-stuff/) that
prevents this sort of file being downloaded. This will return the error `ERROR :
/path/to/your/file: Failed to copy: failed to open source object:
path/restricted_content/.`

If you have more than 10,000 files in a directory then `rclone purge
dropbox:dir` will return the error `Failed to purge: There are too
many files involved in this operation`.  As a work-around do an
`rclone delete dropbox:dir` followed by an `rclone rmdir dropbox:dir`.

When using `rclone link` you'll need to set `--expire` if using a
non-personal account otherwise the visibility may not be correct.
(Note that `--expire` isn't supported on personal accounts). See the
[forum discussion](https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-link-dropbox-permissions/23211) and the 
[dropbox SDK issue](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-go-unofficial/issues/75).

## Get your own Dropbox App ID

When you use rclone with Dropbox in its default configuration you are using rclone's App ID. This is shared between all the rclone users.

Here is how to create your own Dropbox App ID for rclone:

1. Log into the [Dropbox App console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create) with your Dropbox Account (It need not
to be the same account as the Dropbox you want to access)

2. Choose an API => Usually this should be `Dropbox API`

3. Choose the type of access you want to use => `Full Dropbox` or `App Folder`. If you want to use Team Folders, `Full Dropbox` is required ([see here](https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-API-Support-Feedback/How-to-create-team-folder-inside-my-app-s-folder/m-p/601005/highlight/true#M27911)).

4. Name your App. The app name is global, so you can't use `rclone` for example

5. Click the button `Create App`

6. Switch to the `Permissions` tab. Enable at least the following permissions: `account_info.read`, `files.metadata.write`, `files.content.write`, `files.content.read`, `sharing.write`. The `files.metadata.read` and `sharing.read` checkboxes will be marked too. Click `Submit`

7. Switch to the `Settings` tab. Fill `OAuth2 - Redirect URIs` as `http://localhost:53682/` and click on `Add`

8. Find the `App key` and `App secret` values on the `Settings` tab. Use these values in rclone config to add a new remote or edit an existing remote. The `App key` setting corresponds to `client_id` in rclone config, the `App secret` corresponds to `client_secret`

#  Enterprise File Fabric

This backend supports [Storage Made Easy's Enterprise File
Fabric™](https://storagemadeeasy.com/about/) which provides a software
solution to integrate and unify File and Object Storage accessible
through a global file system.

## Configuration

The initial setup for the Enterprise File Fabric backend involves
getting a token from the Enterprise File Fabric which you need to
do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Enterprise File Fabric
   \ "filefabric"
[snip]
Storage> filefabric
** See help for filefabric backend at: https://rclone.org/filefabric/ **

URL of the Enterprise File Fabric to connect to
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Storage Made Easy US
   \ "https://storagemadeeasy.com"
 2 / Storage Made Easy EU
   \ "https://eu.storagemadeeasy.com"
 3 / Connect to your Enterprise File Fabric
   \ "https://yourfabric.smestorage.com"
url> https://yourfabric.smestorage.com/
ID of the root folder
Leave blank normally.

Fill in to make rclone start with directory of a given ID.

Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
root_folder_id> 
Permanent Authentication Token

A Permanent Authentication Token can be created in the Enterprise File
Fabric, on the users Dashboard under Security, there is an entry
you'll see called "My Authentication Tokens". Click the Manage button
to create one.

These tokens are normally valid for several years.

For more info see: https://docs.storagemadeeasy.com/organisationcloud/api-tokens

Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
permanent_token> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
Remote config
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: filefabric
- url: https://yourfabric.smestorage.com/
- permanent_token: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Enterprise File Fabric

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Enterprise File Fabric

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Enterprise File Fabric directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modification times and hashes

The Enterprise File Fabric allows modification times to be set on
files accurate to 1 second.  These will be used to detect whether
objects need syncing or not.

The Enterprise File Fabric does not support any data hashes at this time.

### Restricted filename characters

The [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
will be replaced.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Empty files

Empty files aren't supported by the Enterprise File Fabric. Rclone will therefore
upload an empty file as a single space with a mime type of
`application/vnd.rclone.empty.file` and files with that mime type are
treated as empty.

### Root folder ID ###

You can set the `root_folder_id` for rclone.  This is the directory
(identified by its `Folder ID`) that rclone considers to be the root
of your Enterprise File Fabric.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the
correct root to use itself.

However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.

In order to do this you will have to find the `Folder ID` of the
directory you wish rclone to display.  These aren't displayed in the
web interface, but you can use `rclone lsf` to find them, for example

```
$ rclone lsf --dirs-only -Fip --csv filefabric:
120673758,Burnt PDFs/
120673759,My Quick Uploads/
120673755,My Syncs/
120673756,My backups/
120673757,My contacts/
120673761,S3 Storage/
```

The ID for "S3 Storage" would be `120673761`.

#  Files.com

[Files.com](https://www.files.com/) is a cloud storage service that provides a
secure and easy way to store and share files.

The initial setup for filescom involves authenticating with your Files.com
account. You can do this by providing your site subdomain, username, and
password. Alternatively, you can authenticate using an API Key from
[Files.com](https://www.files.com/docs/sdk-and-apis/api-keys/).

#  FTP

FTP is the File Transfer Protocol. Rclone FTP support is provided using the
[github.com/jlaffaye/ftp](https://godoc.org/github.com/jlaffaye/ftp)
package.

[Limitations of Rclone's FTP backend](#limitations)

Paths are specified as `remote:path`. If the path does not begin with
a `/` it is relative to the home directory of the user.  An empty path
`remote:` refers to the user's home directory.

## Configuration

To create an FTP configuration named `remote`, run

    rclone config

Rclone config guides you through an interactive setup process. A minimal
rclone FTP remote definition only requires host, username and password.
For an anonymous FTP server, see [below](#anonymous-ftp).

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config

y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

To see all directories in the home directory of `remote`

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:path/to/directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:path/to/directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote directory, deleting any
excess files in the directory.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:directory

### Anonymous FTP

When connecting to a FTP server that allows anonymous login, you can use the
special "anonymous" username. Traditionally, this user account accepts any
string as a password, although it is common to use either the password
"anonymous" or "guest". Some servers require the use of a valid e-mail
address as password.

Using [on-the-fly](#backend-path-to-dir) or
[connection string](https://rclone.org/docs/#connection-strings) remotes makes it easy to access
such servers, without requiring any configuration in advance. The following
are examples of that:

    rclone lsf :ftp: --ftp-host=speedtest.tele2.net --ftp-user=anonymous --ftp-pass=$(rclone obscure dummy)
    rclone lsf :ftp,host=speedtest.tele2.net,user=anonymous,pass=$(rclone obscure dummy):

The above examples work in Linux shells and in PowerShell, but not Windows
Command Prompt. They execute the [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/)
command to create a password string in the format required by the
[pass](#ftp-pass) option. The following examples are exactly the same, except use
an already obscured string representation of the same password "dummy", and
therefore works even in Windows Command Prompt:

    rclone lsf :ftp: --ftp-host=speedtest.tele2.net --ftp-user=anonymous --ftp-pass=IXs2wc8OJOz7SYLBk47Ji1rHTmxM
    rclone lsf :ftp,host=speedtest.tele2.net,user=anonymous,pass=IXs2wc8OJOz7SYLBk47Ji1rHTmxM:

### Implicit TLS

Rlone FTP supports implicit FTP over TLS servers (FTPS). This has to
be enabled in the FTP backend config for the remote, or with
[`--ftp-tls`](#ftp-tls). The default FTPS port is `990`, not `21` and
can be set with [`--ftp-port`](#ftp-port).

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

File names cannot end with the following characters. Replacement is
limited to the last character in a file name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |

Not all FTP servers can have all characters in file names, for example:

| FTP Server| Forbidden characters |
| --------- |:--------------------:|
| proftpd   | `*`                  |
| pureftpd  | `\ [ ]`              |

This backend's interactive configuration wizard provides a selection of
sensible encoding settings for major FTP servers: ProFTPd, PureFTPd, VsFTPd.
Just hit a selection number when prompted.


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to ftp (FTP).

#### --ftp-host

- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_PORT
- Type:        int
- Default:     21

#### --ftp-pass

FTP password.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

Properties:

- Config:      pass
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_PASS
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --ftp-tls

Use Implicit FTPS (FTP over TLS).

When using implicit FTP over TLS the client connects using TLS
right from the start which breaks compatibility with
non-TLS-aware servers. This is usually served over port 990 rather
than port 21. Cannot be used in combination with explicit FTPS.

Properties:

- Config:      tls
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_TLS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --ftp-explicit-tls

Use Explicit FTPS (FTP over TLS).

When using explicit FTP over TLS the client explicitly requests
security from the server in order to upgrade a plain text connection
to an encrypted one. Cannot be used in combination with implicit FTPS.

Properties:

- Config:      explicit_tls
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_EXPLICIT_TLS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to ftp (FTP).

#### --ftp-concurrency

Maximum number of FTP simultaneous connections, 0 for unlimited.

Note that setting this is very likely to cause deadlocks so it should
be used with care.

If you are doing a sync or copy then make sure concurrency is one more
than the sum of `--transfers` and `--checkers`.

If you use `--check-first` then it just needs to be one more than the
maximum of `--checkers` and `--transfers`.

So for `concurrency 3` you'd use `--checkers 2 --transfers 2
--check-first` or `--checkers 1 --transfers 1`.



Properties:

- Config:      concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     0

#### --ftp-no-check-certificate

Do not verify the TLS certificate of the server.

Properties:

- Config:      no_check_certificate
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_NO_CHECK_CERTIFICATE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --ftp-force-list-hidden

Use LIST -a to force listing of hidden files and folders. This will disable the use of MLSD.

Properties:

- Config:      force_list_hidden
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_FORCE_LIST_HIDDEN
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --ftp-idle-timeout

Max time before closing idle connections.

If no connections have been returned to the connection pool in the time
given, rclone will empty the connection pool.

- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --ftp-tls-cache-size

Size of TLS session cache for all control and data connections.

TLS cache allows to resume TLS sessions and reuse PSK between connections.
Increase if default size is not enough resulting in TLS resumption errors.
Enabled by default. Use 0 to disable.

Properties:

- Config:      tls_cache_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_TLS_CACHE_SIZE
- Type:        int
- Default:     32

#### --ftp-disable-tls13

Disable TLS 1.3 (workaround for FTP servers with buggy TLS)

- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --ftp-shut-timeout

Maximum time to wait for data connection closing status.

Properties:

- Config:      shut_timeout
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_SHUT_TIMEOUT
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --ftp-ask-password

Allow asking for FTP password when needed.

If this is set and no password is supplied then rclone will ask for a password


Properties:

- Config:      socks_proxy
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_SOCKS_PROXY
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --ftp-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,Del,Ctl,RightSpace,Dot

## Limitations

FTP servers acting as rclone remotes must support `passive` mode.
The mode cannot be configured as `passive` is the only supported one.
Rclone's FTP implementation is not compatible with `active` mode
as [the library it uses doesn't support it](https://github.com/jlaffaye/ftp/issues/29).
This will likely never be supported due to security concerns.

Rclone's FTP backend does not support any checksums but can compare
file sizes.

`rclone about` is not supported by the FTP backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) and [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

The implementation of : `--dump headers`,
`--dump bodies`, `--dump auth` for debugging isn't the same as
for rclone HTTP based backends - it has less fine grained control.

`--timeout` isn't supported (but `--contimeout` is).

`--bind` isn't supported.

Rclone's FTP backend could support server-side move but does not
at present.

The `ftp_proxy` environment variable is not currently supported.

### Modification times

File modification time (timestamps) is supported to 1 second resolution
for major FTP servers: ProFTPd, PureFTPd, VsFTPd, and FileZilla FTP server.
The `VsFTPd` server has non-standard implementation of time related protocol
commands and needs a special configuration setting: `writing_mdtm = true`.

Support for precise file time with other FTP servers varies depending on what
protocol extensions they advertise. If all the `MLSD`, `MDTM` and `MFTM`
extensions are present, rclone will use them together to provide precise time.
Otherwise the times you see on the FTP server through rclone are those of the
last file upload.

You can use the following command to check whether rclone can use precise time
with your FTP server: `rclone backend features your_ftp_remote:` (the trailing
colon is important). Look for the number in the line tagged by `Precision`
designating the remote time precision expressed as nanoseconds. A value of
`1000000000` means that file time precision of 1 second is available.
A value of `3153600000000000000` (or another large number) means "unsupported".

#  Gofile

[Gofile](https://gofile.io) is a content storage and distribution
platform. Its aim is to provide as much service as possible for free
or at a very low price.

The initial setup for Gofile involves logging in to the web interface
and going to the "My Profile" section. Copy the "Account API token"
for use in the config file.

Note that if you wish to connect rclone to Gofile you will need a
premium account.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

Enter name for new remote.
name> remote

Option Storage.
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.
XX / Gofile
   \ (gofile)
Storage> gofile

Option access_token.
API Access token
You can get this from the web control panel.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
access_token> YOURACCESSTOKEN

Edit advanced config?
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n

Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: gofile
- access_token: YOURACCESSTOKEN
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories and files in the top level of your Gofile

    rclone lsf remote:

To copy a local directory to an Gofile directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modification times and hashes

Gofile supports modification times with a resolution of 1 second.

Gofile supports MD5 hashes, so you can use the `--checksum` flag.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| !         | 0x21  | ！           |
| "         | 0x22  | ＂           |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊           |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：           |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜           |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞           |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？           |
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜           |


File names can also not start or end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the first or last character in the
name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| .         | 0x2E  | ．           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Public Links

Gofile supports `rclone link` to make public links to files or
directories. If you specify a directory it will download as a `zip`
file. You can use the `--expire` flag to specify the time the link
should be valid. Note that `rclone link --unlink` removes all the
public links for a file.

### Root folder ID

You can set the `root_folder_id` for rclone.  This is the directory
(identified by its `Folder ID`) that rclone considers to be the root
of your Gofile drive.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the
correct root to use itself and fill in the value in the config file.

However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.

In order to do this you will have to find the `Folder ID` of the
directory you wish rclone to display.

You can do this with rclone

```
$ rclone lsf -Fip --dirs-only remote:
d6341f53-ee65-4f29-9f59-d11e8070b2a0;Files/
f4f5c9b8-6ece-478b-b03e-4538edfe5a1c;Photos/
d50e356c-29ca-4b27-a3a7-494d91026e04;Videos/
```

The ID to use is the part before the `;` so you could set

```
root_folder_id = d6341f53-ee65-4f29-9f59-d11e8070b2a0
```

To restrict rclone to the `Files` directory.


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to gofile (Gofile).

#### --gofile-access-token

API Access token

You can get this from the web control panel.

Properties:

- Config:      access_token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOFILE_ACCESS_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to gofile (Gofile).

#### --gofile-root-folder-id

ID of the root folder

Leave this blank normally, rclone will fill it in automatically.

If you want rclone to be restricted to a particular folder you can
fill it in - see the docs for more info.


Properties:

- Config:      root_folder_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOFILE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gofile-account-id

Account ID

Leave this blank normally, rclone will fill it in automatically.


Properties:

- Config:      account_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOFILE_ACCOUNT_ID
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gofile-list-chunk

Number of items to list in each call

Properties:

- Config:      list_chunk
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOFILE_LIST_CHUNK
- Type:        int
- Default:     1000

#### --gofile-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOFILE_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,LeftPeriod,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot,Exclamation

#### --gofile-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GOFILE_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false



## Limitations

Gofile only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length, where a
character is a unicode character.

Directories should not be cached for more than 24h otherwise files in
the directory may not be downloadable. In practice this means when
using a VFS based rclone command such as `rclone mount` you should
make sure `--dir-cache-time` is less than `24h`.

Note that Gofile is currently limited to a total of 100,000 items. If
you attempt to upload more than that you will get
`error-limit-100000`. This limit may be lifted in the future.

### Duplicated files

Gofile is capable of having files with duplicated file names. For
instance two files called `hello.txt` in the same directory.

Rclone cannot sync that to a normal file system but it can be fixed
with the `rclone dedupe` command.

Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.

Use `rclone dedupe` to fix duplicated files.

#  Google Cloud Storage

Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for google cloud storage involves getting a token from Google Cloud Storage
which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if using web browser to automatically 
authenticate. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this
it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all the buckets in your project

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:bucket

### Service Account support

You can set up rclone with Google Cloud Storage in an unattended mode,
i.e. not tied to a specific end-user Google account. This is useful
when you want to synchronise files onto machines that don't have
actively logged-in users, for example build machines.

To get credentials for Google Cloud Platform
[IAM Service Accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts),
please head to the
[Service Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/permissions/serviceaccounts)
section of the Google Developer Console. Service Accounts behave just
like normal `User` permissions in
[Google Cloud Storage ACLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control),
so you can limit their access (e.g. make them read only). After
creating an account, a JSON file containing the Service Account's
credentials will be downloaded onto your machines. These credentials
are what rclone will use for authentication.

To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path
to your Service Account credentials at the `service_account_file`
prompt and rclone won't use the browser based authentication
flow. If you'd rather stuff the contents of the credentials file into
the rclone config file, you can set `service_account_credentials` with
the actual contents of the file instead, or set the equivalent
environment variable.

### Anonymous Access

For downloads of objects that permit public access you can configure rclone
to use anonymous access by setting `anonymous` to `true`.
With unauthorized access you can't write or create files but only read or list
those buckets and objects that have public read access.

### Application Default Credentials

If no other source of credentials is provided, rclone will fall back
to
[Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/common/auth#authenticating_with_application_default_credentials)
this is useful both when you already have configured authentication
for your developer account, or in production when running on a google
compute host. Note that if running in docker, you may need to run
additional commands on your google compute machine -
[see this page](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#gcloud_as_a_docker_credential_helper).

Note that in the case application default credentials are used, there
is no need to explicitly configure a project number.

### --fast-list

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

### Custom upload headers

You can set custom upload headers with the `--header-upload`
flag. Google Cloud Storage supports the headers as described in the
[working with metadata documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/WorkingWithObjectMetadata)

- Cache-Control
- Content-Disposition
- Content-Encoding
- Content-Language
- Content-Type
- X-Goog-Storage-Class
- X-Goog-Meta-

Eg `--header-upload "Content-Type text/potato"`

Note that the last of these is for setting custom metadata in the form
`--header-upload "x-goog-meta-key: value"`

### Modification times

Google Cloud Storage stores md5sum natively.
Google's [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) tool stores modification time
with one-second precision as `goog-reserved-file-mtime` in file metadata.

To ensure compatibility with gsutil, rclone stores modification time in 2 separate metadata entries.
`mtime` uses RFC3339 format with one-nanosecond precision.
`goog-reserved-file-mtime` uses Unix timestamp format with one-second precision.
To get modification time from object metadata, rclone reads the metadata in the following order: `mtime`, `goog-reserved-file-mtime`, object updated time.

Note that rclone's default modify window is 1ns.
Files uploaded by gsutil only contain timestamps with one-second precision.
If you use rclone to sync files previously uploaded by gsutil,
rclone will attempt to update modification time for all these files.
To avoid these possibly unnecessary updates, use `--modify-window 1s`.

### Restricted filename characters

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| LF        | 0x0A  | ␊           |
| CR        | 0x0D  | ␍           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),

        - Get GCP IAM credentials from the environment (env vars or IAM).

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to google cloud storage (Google Cloud Storage (this is not Google Drive)).

#### --gcs-token

OAuth Access Token as a JSON blob.

Properties:

- Config:      token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GCS_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gcs-auth-url

Auth server URL.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

Properties:

- Config:      auth_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GCS_AUTH_URL
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gcs-token-url

Token server url.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

Properties:

- Config:      token_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GCS_TOKEN_URL
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gcs-directory-markers

Upload an empty object with a trailing slash when a new directory is created

Empty folders are unsupported for bucket based remotes, this option creates an empty
object ending with "/", to persist the folder.


Properties:

- Config:      directory_markers
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GCS_DIRECTORY_MARKERS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gcs-no-check-bucket

If set, don't attempt to check the bucket exists or create it.

This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions
rclone does if you know the bucket exists already.


Properties:

- Config:      no_check_bucket
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GCS_NO_CHECK_BUCKET
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gcs-decompress

If set this will decompress gzip encoded objects.

It is possible to upload objects to GCS with "Content-Encoding: gzip"
set. Normally rclone will download these files as compressed objects.

If this flag is set then rclone will decompress these files with
"Content-Encoding: gzip" as they are received. This means that rclone
can't check the size and hash but the file contents will be decompressed.


Properties:

- Config:      decompress
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GCS_DECOMPRESS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gcs-endpoint

Endpoint for the service.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

- Config:      endpoint
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GCS_ENDPOINT
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gcs-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GCS_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,CrLf,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --gcs-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GCS_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false



## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the Google Cloud Storage backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) and [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Google Drive

Paths are specified as `drive:path`

Drive paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `drive:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for drive involves getting a token from Google drive
which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/r/c/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Google Drive
   \ "drive"

Scope that rclone should use when requesting access from drive.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Full access all files, excluding Application Data Folder.
   \ "drive"
 2 / Read-only access to file metadata and file contents.
   \ "drive.readonly"
   / Access to files created by rclone only.
 3 | These are visible in the drive website.
   | File authorization is revoked when the user deauthorizes the app.
   \ "drive.file"
   / Allows read and write access to the Application Data folder.
 4 | This is not visible in the drive website.
   \ "drive.appfolder"
   / Allows read-only access to file metadata but
 5 | does not allow any access to read or download file content.
   \ "drive.metadata.readonly"
scope> 1
Service Account Credentials JSON file path - needed only if you want use SA instead of interactive login.

Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if using web browser to automatically 
authenticate. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and it
may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your drive

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your drive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a drive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Scopes

Rclone allows you to select which scope you would like for rclone to
use.  This changes what type of token is granted to rclone.  [The
scopes are defined
here](https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/about-auth).

A comma-separated list is allowed e.g. `drive.readonly,drive.file`.

The scope are

#### drive

This is the default scope and allows full access to all files, except
for the Application Data Folder (see below).

Choose this one if you aren't sure.

#### drive.readonly

This allows read only access to all files.  Files may be listed and
downloaded but not uploaded, renamed or deleted.

#### drive.file

With this scope rclone can read/view/modify only those files and
folders it creates.

So if you uploaded files to drive via the web interface (or any other
means) they will not be visible to rclone.

This can be useful if you are using rclone to backup data and you want
to be sure confidential data on your drive is not visible to rclone.

Files created with this scope are visible in the web interface.

#### drive.appfolder

This gives rclone its own private area to store files.  Rclone will
not be able to see any other files on your drive and you won't be able
to see rclone's files from the web interface either.

#### drive.metadata.readonly

This allows read only access to file names only.  It does not allow
rclone to download or upload data, or rename or delete files or
directories.

### Root folder ID

This option has been moved to the advanced section. You can set the `root_folder_id` for rclone.  This is the directory
(identified by its `Folder ID`) that rclone considers to be the root
of your drive.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the
correct root to use itself.

However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy or to access data within the "Computers" tab on the drive
web interface (where files from Google's Backup and Sync desktop
program go).

In order to do this you will have to find the `Folder ID` of the
directory you wish rclone to display.  This will be the last segment
of the URL when you open the relevant folder in the drive web
interface.

So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
`https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh`
in the browser, then you use `1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh` as
the `root_folder_id` in the config.

**NB** folders under the "Computers" tab seem to be read only (drive
gives a 500 error) when using rclone.

There doesn't appear to be an API to discover the folder IDs of the
"Computers" tab - please contact us if you know otherwise!

Note also that rclone can't access any data under the "Backups" tab on
the google drive web interface yet.

### Service Account support

You can set up rclone with Google Drive in an unattended mode,
i.e. not tied to a specific end-user Google account. This is useful
when you want to synchronise files onto machines that don't have
actively logged-in users, for example build machines.

To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path
to your Service Account credentials at the `service_account_file`
prompt during `rclone config` and rclone won't use the browser based
authentication flow. If you'd rather stuff the contents of the
credentials file into the rclone config file, you can set
`service_account_credentials` with the actual contents of the file
instead, or set the equivalent environment variable.

#### Use case - Google Workspace account and individual Drive

Let's say that you are the administrator of a Google Workspace. The
goal is to read or write data on an individual's Drive account, who IS
a member of the domain. We'll call the domain **example.com**, and the
user **foo@example.com**.

There's a few steps we need to go through to accomplish this:

##### 1. Create a service account for example.com

  - To create a service account and obtain its credentials, go to the
[Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com).
  - You must have a project - create one if you don't and make sure you are on the selected project.
  - Then go to "IAM & admin" -> "Service Accounts".
  - Use the "Create Service Account" button. Fill in "Service account name"
and "Service account ID" with something that identifies your client.
  - Select "Create And Continue". Step 2 and 3 are optional.
  - Click on the newly created service account
  - Click "Keys" and then "Add Key" and then "Create new key"
  - Choose type "JSON" and click create
  - This will download a small JSON file that rclone will use for authentication.

If you ever need to remove access, press the "Delete service
account key" button.

##### 2. Allowing API access to example.com Google Drive

  - Go to example.com's [Workspace Admin Console](https://admin.google.com)
  - Go into "Security" (or use the search bar)
  - Select "Access and data control" and then "API controls"
  - Click "Manage domain-wide delegation"
  - Click "Add new"
  - In the "Client ID" field enter the service account's
"Client ID" - this can be found in the Developer Console under
"IAM & Admin" -> "Service Accounts", then "View Client ID" for
the newly created service account.
It is a ~21 character numerical string.
  - In the next field, "OAuth Scopes", enter
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`
to grant read/write access to Google Drive specifically.
You can also use `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` for read only access.
  - Click "Authorise"

##### 3. Configure rclone, assuming a new install

```
rclone config

n/s/q> n         # New
name>gdrive      # Gdrive is an example name
Storage>         # Type drive
client_id>       # Can be left blank
client_secret>   # Can be left blank
scope>           # Select the scope use used in step 2
root_folder_id>  # Can be left blank
service_account_file> /home/foo/myJSONfile.json # Path to the JSON file you downloaded in step 1.
y/n>             # Auto config, n

```

##### 4. Verify that it's working

  - `rclone -v --drive-impersonate foo@example.com lsf gdrive:backup`
  - The arguments do:
    - `-v` - verbose logging
    - `--drive-impersonate foo@example.com` - this is what does
the magic, pretending to be user foo.
    - `lsf` - list files in a parsing friendly way
    - `gdrive:backup` - use the remote called gdrive, work in
the folder named backup.

Note: in case you configured a specific root folder on gdrive and rclone is unable to access the contents of that folder when using `--drive-impersonate`, do this instead:
  - in the gdrive web interface, share your root folder with the user/email of the new Service Account you created/selected at step 1
  - use rclone without specifying the `--drive-impersonate` option, like this:
        `rclone -v lsf gdrive:backup`


### Shared drives (team drives)

If you want to configure the remote to point to a Google Shared Drive
(previously known as Team Drives) then answer `y` to the question
`Configure this as a Shared Drive (Team Drive)?`.

This will fetch the list of Shared Drives from google and allow you to
configure which one you want to use. You can also type in a Shared
Drive ID if you prefer.

For example:

```
Configure this as a Shared Drive (Team Drive)?
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
Fetching Shared Drive list...
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Rclone Test
   \ "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
 2 / Rclone Test 2
   \ "yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"
 3 / Rclone Test 3
   \ "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
Enter a Shared Drive ID> 1
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: drive
- client_id:
- client_secret:
- token: {"AccessToken":"xxxx.x.xxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","RefreshToken":"1/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","Expiry":"2014-03-16T13:57:58.955387075Z","Extra":null}
- team_drive: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

### --fast-list

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

It does this by combining multiple `list` calls into a single API request.

This works by combining many `'%s' in parents` filters into one expression.
To list the contents of directories a, b and c, the following requests will be send by the regular `List` function:
```
trashed=false and 'a' in parents
trashed=false and 'b' in parents
trashed=false and 'c' in parents
```
These can now be combined into a single request:
```
trashed=false and ('a' in parents or 'b' in parents or 'c' in parents)
```

The implementation of `ListR` will put up to 50 `parents` filters into one request.
It will  use the `--checkers` value to specify the number of requests to run in parallel.

In tests, these batch requests were up to 20x faster than the regular method.
Running the following command against different sized folders gives:
```
rclone lsjson -vv -R --checkers=6 gdrive:folder
```

small folder (220 directories, 700 files):

- without `--fast-list`: 38s
- with `--fast-list`: 10s

large folder (10600 directories, 39000 files):

- without `--fast-list`: 22:05 min
- with `--fast-list`: 58s

### Modification times and hashes

Google drive stores modification times accurate to 1 ms.

Hash algorithms MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 are supported. Note, however,
that a small fraction of files uploaded may not have SHA1 or SHA256
hashes especially if they were uploaded before 2018.

### Restricted filename characters

Only Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

In contrast to other backends, `/` can also be used in names and `.`
or `..` are valid names.

### Revisions

Google drive stores revisions of files.  When you upload a change to
an existing file to google drive using rclone it will create a new
revision of that file.

Revisions follow the standard google policy which at time of writing
was

  * They are deleted after 30 days or 100 revisions (whatever comes first).
  * They do not count towards a user storage quota.

### Deleting files

By default rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting
files.  If deleting them permanently is required then use the
`--drive-use-trash=false` flag, or set the equivalent environment
variable.

### Shortcuts

In March 2020 Google introduced a new feature in Google Drive called
[drive shortcuts](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/9700156)
([API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/shortcuts)). These
will (by September 2020) [replace the ability for files or folders to
be in multiple folders at once](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/simplifying-google-drives-folder-structure-and-sharing-models).

Shortcuts are files that link to other files on Google Drive somewhat
like a symlink in unix, except they point to the underlying file data
(e.g. the inode in unix terms) so they don't break if the source is
renamed or moved about.

By default rclone treats these as follows.

For shortcuts pointing to files:

- When listing a file shortcut appears as the destination file.
- When downloading the contents of the destination file is downloaded.
- When updating shortcut file with a non shortcut file, the shortcut is removed then a new file is uploaded in place of the shortcut.
- When server-side moving (renaming) the shortcut is renamed, not the destination file.
- When server-side copying the shortcut is copied, not the contents of the shortcut. (unless `--drive-copy-shortcut-content` is in use in which case the contents of the shortcut gets copied).
- When deleting the shortcut is deleted not the linked file.
- When setting the modification time, the modification time of the linked file will be set.

For shortcuts pointing to folders:

- When listing the shortcut appears as a folder and that folder will contain the contents of the linked folder appear (including any sub folders)
- When downloading the contents of the linked folder and sub contents are downloaded
- When uploading to a shortcut folder the file will be placed in the linked folder
- When server-side moving (renaming) the shortcut is renamed, not the destination folder
- When server-side copying the contents of the linked folder is copied, not the shortcut.
- When deleting with `rclone rmdir` or `rclone purge` the shortcut is deleted not the linked folder.
- **NB** When deleting with `rclone remove` or `rclone mount` the contents of the linked folder will be deleted.

The [rclone backend](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command can be used to create shortcuts.  

Shortcuts can be completely ignored with the `--drive-skip-shortcuts` flag
or the corresponding `skip_shortcuts` configuration setting.

If you have shortcuts that lead to an infinite recursion in your drive (e.g. a shortcut pointing to a parent folder), `skip_shortcuts` might be mandatory to be able to copy the drive.

### Emptying trash

If you wish to empty your trash you can use the `rclone cleanup remote:`
command which will permanently delete all your trashed files. This command
does not take any path arguments.

Note that Google Drive takes some time (minutes to days) to empty the
trash even though the command returns within a few seconds.  No output
is echoed, so there will be no confirmation even using -v or -vv.

### Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the `rclone about remote:`
command which will display your usage limit (quota), the usage in Google
Drive, the size of all files in the Trash and the space used by other
Google services such as Gmail. This command does not take any path
arguments.

#### Import/Export of google documents

Google documents can be exported from and uploaded to Google Drive.

When rclone downloads a Google doc it chooses a format to download
depending upon the `--drive-export-formats` setting.
By default the export formats are `docx,xlsx,pptx,svg` which are a
sensible default for an editable document.

When choosing a format, rclone runs down the list provided in order
and chooses the first file format the doc can be exported as from the
list. If the file can't be exported to a format on the formats list,
then rclone will choose a format from the default list.

If you prefer an archive copy then you might use `--drive-export-formats
pdf`, or if you prefer openoffice/libreoffice formats you might use
`--drive-export-formats ods,odt,odp`.

Note that rclone adds the extension to the google doc, so if it is
called `My Spreadsheet` on google docs, it will be exported as `My
Spreadsheet.xlsx` or `My Spreadsheet.pdf` etc.

When importing files into Google Drive, rclone will convert all
files with an extension in `--drive-import-formats` to their
associated document type.
rclone will not convert any files by default, since the conversion
is lossy process.

The conversion must result in a file with the same extension when
the `--drive-export-formats` rules are applied to the uploaded document.

Here are some examples for allowed and prohibited conversions.

| export-formats | import-formats | Upload Ext | Document Ext | Allowed |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------- |
| odt | odt | odt | odt | Yes |
| odt | docx,odt | odt | odt | Yes |
|  | docx | docx | docx | Yes |
|  | odt | odt | docx | No |
| odt,docx | docx,odt | docx | odt | No |
| docx,odt | docx,odt | docx | docx | Yes |
| docx,odt | docx,odt | odt | docx | No |

This limitation can be disabled by specifying `--drive-allow-import-name-change`.
When using this flag, rclone can convert multiple files types resulting
in the same document type at once, e.g. with `--drive-import-formats docx,odt,txt`,
all files having these extension would result in a document represented as a docx file.
This brings the additional risk of overwriting a document, if multiple files
have the same stem. Many rclone operations will not handle this name change
in any way. They assume an equal name when copying files and might copy the
file again or delete them when the name changes. 

Here are the possible export extensions with their corresponding mime types.
Most of these can also be used for importing, but there more that are not
listed here. Some of these additional ones might only be available when
the operating system provides the correct MIME type entries.

This list can be changed by Google Drive at any time and might not
represent the currently available conversions.

| Extension | Mime Type | Description |
| --------- |-----------| ------------|
| bmp  | image/bmp | Windows Bitmap format |
| csv  | text/csv | Standard CSV format for Spreadsheets |
| doc  | application/msword | Classic Word file |
| docx | application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document | Microsoft Office Document |
| epub | application/epub+zip | E-book format |
| html | text/html | An HTML Document |
| jpg  | image/jpeg | A JPEG Image File |
| json | application/vnd.google-apps.script+json | JSON Text Format for Google Apps scripts |
| odp  | application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.presentation | Openoffice Presentation |
| ods  | application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet | Openoffice Spreadsheet |
| ods  | application/x-vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet | Openoffice Spreadsheet |
| odt  | application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text | Openoffice Document |
| pdf  | application/pdf | Adobe PDF Format |
| pjpeg | image/pjpeg | Progressive JPEG Image |
| png  | image/png | PNG Image Format|
| pptx | application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation | Microsoft Office Powerpoint |
| rtf  | application/rtf | Rich Text Format |
| svg  | image/svg+xml | Scalable Vector Graphics Format |
| tsv  | text/tab-separated-values | Standard TSV format for spreadsheets |
| txt  | text/plain | Plain Text |
| wmf  | application/x-msmetafile | Windows Meta File |
| xls  | application/vnd.ms-excel | Classic Excel file |
| xlsx | application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet | Microsoft Office Spreadsheet |
| zip  | application/zip | A ZIP file of HTML, Images CSS |

Google documents can also be exported as link files. These files will
open a browser window for the Google Docs website of that document
when opened. The link file extension has to be specified as a
`--drive-export-formats` parameter. They will match all available
Google Documents.

| Extension | Description | OS Support |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| desktop | freedesktop.org specified desktop entry | Linux |
| link.html | An HTML Document with a redirect | All |
| url | INI style link file | macOS, Windows |
| webloc | macOS specific XML format | macOS |

- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-use-trash

Send files to the trash instead of deleting permanently.

Defaults to true, namely sending files to the trash.
Use `--drive-use-trash=false` to delete files permanently instead.

Properties:

- Config:      use_trash
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --drive-copy-shortcut-content

Server side copy contents of shortcuts instead of the shortcut.

When doing server side copies, normally rclone will copy shortcuts as
shortcuts.

If this flag is used then rclone will copy the contents of shortcuts
rather than shortcuts themselves when doing server side copies.

Properties:

- Config:      copy_shortcut_content
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_COPY_SHORTCUT_CONTENT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-skip-gdocs

Skip google documents in all listings.

If given, gdocs practically become invisible to rclone.

Properties:

- Config:      skip_gdocs
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_SKIP_GDOCS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-show-all-gdocs

Show all Google Docs including non-exportable ones in listings.

If you try a server side copy on a Google Form without this flag, you
will get this error:

    No export formats found for "application/vnd.google-apps.form"

However adding this flag will allow the form to be server side copied.

Note that rclone doesn't add extensions to the Google Docs file names
in this mode.

Do **not** use this flag when trying to download Google Docs - rclone
will fail to download them.


Properties:

- Config:      show_all_gdocs
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_SHOW_ALL_GDOCS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-skip-checksum-gphotos

Skip checksums on Google photos and videos only.

Use this if you get checksum errors when transferring Google photos or
videos.

Setting this flag will cause Google photos and videos to return a
blank checksums.

Google photos are identified by being in the "photos" space.

Corrupted checksums are caused by Google modifying the image/video but
not updating the checksum.

Properties:

- Config:      skip_checksum_gphotos
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_SKIP_CHECKSUM_GPHOTOS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-shared-with-me

Only show files that are shared with me.

Instructs rclone to operate on your "Shared with me" folder (where
Google Drive lets you access the files and folders others have shared
with you).

This works both with the "list" (lsd, lsl, etc.) and the "copy"
commands (copy, sync, etc.), and with all other commands too.

Properties:

- Config:      shared_with_me
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_SHARED_WITH_ME
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-trashed-only

Only show files that are in the trash.

This will show trashed files in their original directory structure.

Properties:

- Config:      trashed_only
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_TRASHED_ONLY
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-starred-only

Only show files that are starred.

Properties:

- Config:      starred_only
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_STARRED_ONLY
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-formats

Deprecated: See export_formats.

Properties:

- Config:      formats
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_FORMATS
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --drive-export-formats

Comma separated list of preferred formats for downloading Google docs.

Properties:

- Config:      export_formats
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_EXPORT_FORMATS
- Type:        string
- Default:     "docx,xlsx,pptx,svg"

#### --drive-import-formats

Comma separated list of preferred formats for uploading Google docs.

Properties:

- Config:      import_formats
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_IMPORT_FORMATS
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --drive-allow-import-name-change

Allow the filetype to change when uploading Google docs.

E.g. file.doc to file.docx. This will confuse sync and reupload every time.

Properties:

- Config:      allow_import_name_change
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_ALLOW_IMPORT_NAME_CHANGE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-use-created-date

Use file created date instead of modified date.

Useful when downloading data and you want the creation date used in
place of the last modified date.

**WARNING**: This flag may have some unexpected consequences.

When uploading to your drive all files will be overwritten unless they
haven't been modified since their creation. And the inverse will occur
while downloading.  This side effect can be avoided by using the
"--checksum" flag.

This feature was implemented to retain photos capture date as recorded
by google photos. You will first need to check the "Create a Google
Photos folder" option in your google drive settings. You can then copy
or move the photos locally and use the date the image was taken
(created) set as the modification date.

Properties:

- Config:      use_created_date
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_CREATED_DATE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-use-shared-date

Use date file was shared instead of modified date.

Note that, as with "--drive-use-created-date", this flag may have
unexpected consequences when uploading/downloading files.

If both this flag and "--drive-use-created-date" are set, the created
date is used.

Properties:

- Config:      use_shared_date
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_SHARED_DATE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-list-chunk

Size of listing chunk 100-1000, 0 to disable.

Properties:

- Config:      list_chunk
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_LIST_CHUNK
- Type:        int
- Default:     1000

#### --drive-impersonate

Impersonate this user when using a service account.

Properties:

- Config:      impersonate
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_IMPERSONATE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --drive-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     8Mi

#### --drive-chunk-size

Upload chunk size.

Must a power of 2 >= 256k.

Making this larger will improve performance, but note that each chunk
is buffered in memory one per transfer.

Reducing this will reduce memory usage but decrease performance.

Properties:

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     8Mi

#### --drive-acknowledge-abuse

Set to allow files which return cannotDownloadAbusiveFile to be downloaded.

If downloading a file returns the error "This file has been identified
as malware or spam and cannot be downloaded" with the error code
"cannotDownloadAbusiveFile" then supply this flag to rclone to
indicate you acknowledge the risks of downloading the file and rclone
will download it anyway.

Note that if you are using service account it will need Manager
permission (not Content Manager) to for this flag to work. If the SA
does not have the right permission, Google will just ignore the flag.

Properties:

- Config:      acknowledge_abuse
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_ACKNOWLEDGE_ABUSE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-keep-revision-forever

Keep new head revision of each file forever.

Properties:

- Config:      keep_revision_forever
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_KEEP_REVISION_FOREVER
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-size-as-quota

Show sizes as storage quota usage, not actual size.

Show the size of a file as the storage quota used. This is the
current version plus any older versions that have been set to keep
forever.

**WARNING**: This flag may have some unexpected consequences.

It is not recommended to set this flag in your config - the
recommended usage is using the flag form --drive-size-as-quota when
doing rclone ls/lsl/lsf/lsjson/etc only.

If you do use this flag for syncing (not recommended) then you will
need to use --ignore size also.

Properties:

- Config:      size_as_quota
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_SIZE_AS_QUOTA
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-v2-download-min-size

If Object's are greater, use drive v2 API to download.

Properties:

- Config:      v2_download_min_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_V2_DOWNLOAD_MIN_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     off

#### --drive-pacer-min-sleep

Minimum time to sleep between API calls.

Properties:

- Config:      pacer_min_sleep
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_PACER_MIN_SLEEP
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     100ms

#### --drive-pacer-burst

Number of API calls to allow without sleeping.

Properties:

- Config:      pacer_burst
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_PACER_BURST
- Type:        int
- Default:     100

#### --drive-server-side-across-configs

Deprecated: use --server-side-across-configs instead.

Allow server-side operations (e.g. copy) to work across different drive configs.

This can be useful if you wish to do a server-side copy between two
different Google drives.  Note that this isn't enabled by default
because it isn't easy to tell if it will work between any two
configurations.

Properties:

- Config:      server_side_across_configs
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_SERVER_SIDE_ACROSS_CONFIGS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-disable-http2

Disable drive using http2.

There is currently an unsolved issue with the google drive backend and
HTTP/2.  HTTP/2 is therefore disabled by default for the drive backend
but can be re-enabled here.  When the issue is solved this flag will
be removed.

See: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3631



Properties:

- Config:      disable_http2
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_DISABLE_HTTP2
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --drive-stop-on-upload-limit

Make upload limit errors be fatal.

At the time of writing it is only possible to upload 750 GiB of data to
Google Drive a day (this is an undocumented limit). When this limit is
reached Google Drive produces a slightly different error message. When
this flag is set it causes these errors to be fatal.  These will stop
the in-progress sync.

Note that this detection is relying on error message strings which
Google don't document so it may break in the future.

See: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3857


Properties:

- Config:      stop_on_upload_limit
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_STOP_ON_UPLOAD_LIMIT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-stop-on-download-limit

Make download limit errors be fatal.

At the time of writing it is only possible to download 10 TiB of data from
Google Drive a day (this is an undocumented limit). When this limit is
reached Google Drive produces a slightly different error message. When
this flag is set it causes these errors to be fatal.  These will stop
the in-progress sync.

Note that this detection is relying on error message strings which
Google don't document so it may break in the future.


Properties:

- Config:      stop_on_download_limit
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_STOP_ON_DOWNLOAD_LIMIT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-skip-shortcuts

If set skip shortcut files.

Normally rclone dereferences shortcut files making them appear as if
they are the original file (see [the shortcuts section](#shortcuts)).
If this flag is set then rclone will ignore shortcut files completely.


Properties:

- Config:      skip_shortcuts
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_SKIP_SHORTCUTS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-skip-dangling-shortcuts

If set skip dangling shortcut files.

If this is set then rclone will not show any dangling shortcuts in listings.


Properties:

- Config:      skip_dangling_shortcuts
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_SKIP_DANGLING_SHORTCUTS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-resource-key

Resource key for accessing a link-shared file.

If you need to access files shared with a link like this

    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/XXX?resourcekey=YYY&usp=sharing

Then you will need to use the first part "XXX" as the "root_folder_id"
and the second part "YYY" as the "resource_key" otherwise you will get
404 not found errors when trying to access the directory.

See: https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/resource-keys

This resource key requirement only applies to a subset of old files.

Note also that opening the folder once in the web interface (with the
user you've authenticated rclone with) seems to be enough so that the
resource key is not needed.


Properties:

- Config:      resource_key
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_RESOURCE_KEY
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --drive-fast-list-bug-fix

Work around a bug in Google Drive listing.

Normally rclone will work around a bug in Google Drive when using
--fast-list (ListR) where the search "(A in parents) or (B in
parents)" returns nothing sometimes. See #3114, #4289 and
https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/149522397

Rclone detects this by finding no items in more than one directory
when listing and retries them as lists of individual directories.

This means that if you have a lot of empty directories rclone will end
up listing them all individually and this can take many more API
calls.

This flag allows the work-around to be disabled. This is **not**
recommended in normal use - only if you have a particular case you are
having trouble with like many empty directories.


Properties:

- Config:      fast_list_bug_fix
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_FAST_LIST_BUG_FIX
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --drive-metadata-owner

Control whether owner should be read or written in metadata.

Owner is a standard part of the file metadata so is easy to read. But it
isn't always desirable to set the owner from the metadata.

Note that you can't set the owner on Shared Drives, and that setting
ownership will generate an email to the new owner (this can't be
disabled), and you can't transfer ownership to someone outside your
organization.


Properties:

- Config:      metadata_owner
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_METADATA_OWNER
- Type:        Bits
- Default:     read
- Examples:
    - "off"
        - Do not read or write the value
    - "read"
        - Read the value only
    - "write"
        - Write the value only
    - "failok"
        - If writing fails log errors only, don't fail the transfer
    - "read,write"
        - Read and Write the value.

#### --drive-metadata-permissions

Control whether permissions should be read or written in metadata.

Reading permissions metadata from files can be done quickly, but it
isn't always desirable to set the permissions from the metadata.

Note that rclone drops any inherited permissions on Shared Drives and
any owner permission on My Drives as these are duplicated in the owner
metadata.


Properties:

- Config:      metadata_permissions
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_METADATA_PERMISSIONS
- Type:        Bits
- Default:     off
- Examples:
    - "off"
        - Do not read or write the value
    - "read"
        - Read the value only
    - "write"
        - Write the value only
    - "failok"
        - If writing fails log errors only, don't fail the transfer
    - "read,write"
        - Read and Write the value.

#### --drive-metadata-labels

Control whether labels should be read or written in metadata.

Reading labels metadata from files takes an extra API transaction and
will slow down listings. It isn't always desirable to set the labels
from the metadata.

The format of labels is documented in the drive API documentation at
https://developers.google.com/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/Label -
rclone just provides a JSON dump of this format.

When setting labels, the label and fields must already exist - rclone
will not create them. This means that if you are transferring labels
from two different accounts you will have to create the labels in
advance and use the metadata mapper to translate the IDs between the
two accounts.


Properties:

- Config:      metadata_labels
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_METADATA_LABELS
- Type:        Bits
- Default:     off
- Examples:
    - "off"
        - Do not read or write the value
    - "read"
        - Read the value only
    - "write"
        - Write the value only
    - "failok"
        - If writing fails log errors only, don't fail the transfer
    - "read,write"
        - Read and Write the value.

#### --drive-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     InvalidUtf8

#### --drive-env-auth

Get IAM credentials from runtime (environment variables or instance meta data if no env vars).

Only applies if service_account_file and service_account_credentials is blank.

Properties:

- Config:      env_auth
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_ENV_AUTH
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false
- Examples:
    - "false"
        - Enter credentials in the next step.
    - "true"
        - Get GCP IAM credentials from the environment (env vars or IAM).

#### --drive-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

### Metadata

User metadata is stored in the properties field of the drive object.

Metadata is supported on files and directories.

Here are the possible system metadata items for the drive backend.

| Name | Help | Type | Example | Read Only |
|------|------|------|---------|-----------|
| btime | Time of file birth (creation) with mS accuracy. Note that this is only writable on fresh uploads - it can't be written for updates. | RFC 3339 | 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999Z07:00 | N |
| content-type | The MIME type of the file. | string | text/plain | N |
| copy-requires-writer-permission | Whether the options to copy, print, or download this file, should be disabled for readers and commenters. | boolean | true | N |
| description | A short description of the file. | string | Contract for signing | N |
| folder-color-rgb | The color for a folder or a shortcut to a folder as an RGB hex string. | string | 881133 | N |
| labels | Labels attached to this file in a JSON dump of Googled drive format. Enable with --drive-metadata-labels. | JSON | [] | N |
| mtime | Time of last modification with mS accuracy. | RFC 3339 | 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999Z07:00 | N |
| owner | The owner of the file. Usually an email address. Enable with --drive-metadata-owner. | string | user@example.com | N |
| permissions | Permissions in a JSON dump of Google drive format. On shared drives these will only be present if they aren't inherited. Enable with --drive-metadata-permissions. | JSON | {} | N |
| starred | Whether the user has starred the file. | boolean | false | N |
| viewed-by-me | Whether the file has been viewed by this user. | boolean | true | **Y** |
| writers-can-share | Whether users with only writer permission can modify the file's permissions. Not populated and ignored when setting for items in shared drives. | boolean | false | N |

See the [metadata](https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata) docs for more info.

## Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the drive backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the [backend](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command).

### get

Get command for fetching the drive config parameters

    rclone backend get remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This is a get command which will be used to fetch the various drive config parameters

Usage Examples:

    rclone backend get drive: [-o service_account_file] [-o chunk_size]
    rclone rc backend/command command=get fs=drive: [-o service_account_file] [-o chunk_size]


Options:

- "chunk_size": show the current upload chunk size
- "service_account_file": show the current service account file

### set

Set command for updating the drive config parameters

    rclone backend set remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This is a set command which will be used to update the various drive config parameters

Usage Examples:

    rclone backend set drive: [-o service_account_file=sa.json] [-o chunk_size=67108864]
    rclone rc backend/command command=set fs=drive: [-o service_account_file=sa.json] [-o chunk_size=67108864]


Options:

- "chunk_size": update the current upload chunk size
- "service_account_file": update the current service account file

### shortcut

Create shortcuts from files or directories

    rclone backend shortcut remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command creates shortcuts from files or directories.

Usage:

    rclone backend shortcut drive: source_item destination_shortcut
    rclone backend shortcut drive: source_item -o target=drive2: destination_shortcut

In the first example this creates a shortcut from the "source_item"
which can be a file or a directory to the "destination_shortcut". The
"source_item" and the "destination_shortcut" should be relative paths
from "drive:"

In the second example this creates a shortcut from the "source_item"
relative to "drive:" to the "destination_shortcut" relative to
"drive2:". This may fail with a permission error if the user
authenticated with "drive2:" can't read files from "drive:".


Options:

- "target": optional target remote for the shortcut destination

### drives

List the Shared Drives available to this account

    rclone backend drives remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command lists the Shared Drives (Team Drives) available to this
account.

Usage:

    rclone backend [-o config] drives drive:

This will return a JSON list of objects like this

    [
        {
            "id": "0ABCDEF-01234567890",
            "kind": "drive#teamDrive",
            "name": "My Drive"
        },
        {
            "id": "0ABCDEFabcdefghijkl",
            "kind": "drive#teamDrive",
            "name": "Test Drive"
        }
    ]

With the -o config parameter it will output the list in a format
suitable for adding to a config file to make aliases for all the
drives found and a combined drive.

    [My Drive]
    type = alias
    remote = drive,team_drive=0ABCDEF-01234567890,root_folder_id=:

    [Test Drive]
    type = alias
    remote = drive,team_drive=0ABCDEFabcdefghijkl,root_folder_id=:

    [AllDrives]
    type = combine
    upstreams = "My Drive=My Drive:" "Test Drive=Test Drive:"

Adding this to the rclone config file will cause those team drives to
be accessible with the aliases shown. Any illegal characters will be
substituted with "_" and duplicate names will have numbers suffixed.
It will also add a remote called AllDrives which shows all the shared
drives combined into one directory tree.


### untrash

Untrash files and directories

    rclone backend untrash remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command untrashes all the files and directories in the directory
passed in recursively.

Usage:

This takes an optional directory to trash which make this easier to
use via the API.

    rclone backend untrash drive:directory
    rclone backend --interactive untrash drive:directory subdir

Use the --interactive/-i or --dry-run flag to see what would be restored before restoring it.

Result:

    {
        "Untrashed": 17,
        "Errors": 0
    }


### copyid

Copy files by ID

    rclone backend copyid remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command copies files by ID

Usage:

    rclone backend copyid drive: ID path
    rclone backend copyid drive: ID1 path1 ID2 path2

It copies the drive file with ID given to the path (an rclone path which
will be passed internally to rclone copyto). The ID and path pairs can be
repeated.

The path should end with a / to indicate copy the file as named to
this directory. If it doesn't end with a / then the last path
component will be used as the file name.

If the destination is a drive backend then server-side copying will be
attempted if possible.

Use the --interactive/-i or --dry-run flag to see what would be copied before copying.


### exportformats

Dump the export formats for debug purposes

    rclone backend exportformats remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

### importformats

Dump the import formats for debug purposes

    rclone backend importformats remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

### query

List files using Google Drive query language

    rclone backend query remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command lists files based on a query

Usage:

    rclone backend query drive: query
    
The query syntax is documented at [Google Drive Search query terms and 
operators](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/ref-search-terms).

For example:

	rclone backend query drive: "'0ABc9DEFGHIJKLMNop0QRatUVW3X' in parents and name contains 'foo'"

If the query contains literal ' or \ characters, these need to be escaped with
\ characters. "'" becomes "\'" and "\" becomes "\\\", for example to match a 
file named "foo ' \.txt":

	rclone backend query drive: "name = 'foo \' \\\.txt'"

The result is a JSON array of matches, for example:

    [
	{
		"createdTime": "2017-06-29T19:58:28.537Z",
		"id": "0AxBe_CDEF4zkGHI4d0FjYko2QkD",
		"md5Checksum": "68518d16be0c6fbfab918be61d658032",
		"mimeType": "text/plain",
		"modifiedTime": "2024-02-02T10:40:02.874Z",
		"name": "foo ' \\.txt",
		"parents": [
			"0BxAe_BCDE4zkFGZpcWJGek0xbzC"
		],
		"resourceKey": "0-ABCDEFGHIXJQpIGqBJq3MC",
		"sha1Checksum": "8f284fa768bfb4e45d076a579ab3905ab6bfa893",
		"size": "311",
		"webViewLink": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0AxBe_CDEF4zkGHI4d0FjYko2QkD/view?usp=drivesdk\u0026resourcekey=0-ABCDEFGHIXJQpIGqBJq3MC"
	}
    ]



## Limitations

Drive has quite a lot of rate limiting.  This causes rclone to be
limited to transferring about 2 files per second only.  Individual
files may be transferred much faster at 100s of MiB/s but lots of
small files can take a long time.

Server side copies are also subject to a separate rate limit. If you
see User rate limit exceeded errors, wait at least 24 hours and retry.
You can disable server-side copies with `--disable copy` to download
and upload the files if you prefer.

### Limitations of Google Docs

Google docs will appear as size -1 in `rclone ls`, `rclone ncdu` etc,
and as size 0 in anything which uses the VFS layer, e.g. `rclone mount`
and `rclone serve`. When calculating directory totals, e.g. in
`rclone size` and `rclone ncdu`, they will be counted in as empty
files.

This is because rclone can't find out the size of the Google docs
without downloading them.

Google docs will transfer correctly with `rclone sync`, `rclone copy`
etc as rclone knows to ignore the size when doing the transfer.

However an unfortunate consequence of this is that you may not be able
to download Google docs using `rclone mount`. If it doesn't work you
will get a 0 sized file.  If you try again the doc may gain its
correct size and be downloadable. Whether it will work on not depends
on the application accessing the mount and the OS you are running -
experiment to find out if it does work for you!

### Duplicated files

Sometimes, for no reason I've been able to track down, drive will
duplicate a file that rclone uploads.  Drive unlike all the other
remotes can have duplicated files.

Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.

Use `rclone dedupe` to fix duplicated files.

Note that this isn't just a problem with rclone, even Google Photos on
Android duplicates files on drive sometimes.

### Rclone appears to be re-copying files it shouldn't

The most likely cause of this is the duplicated file issue above - run
`rclone dedupe` and check your logs for duplicate object or directory
messages.

This can also be caused by a delay/caching on google drive's end when
comparing directory listings. Specifically with team drives used in
combination with --fast-list. Files that were uploaded recently may
not appear on the directory list sent to rclone when using --fast-list.

Waiting a moderate period of time between attempts (estimated to be
approximately 1 hour) and/or not using --fast-list both seem to be
effective in preventing the problem.

### SHA1 or SHA256 hashes may be missing

All files have MD5 hashes, but a small fraction of files uploaded may
not have SHA1 or SHA256 hashes especially if they were uploaded before 2018.

## Making your own client_id

When you use rclone with Google drive in its default configuration you
are using rclone's client_id.  This is shared between all the rclone
users.  There is a global rate limit on the number of queries per
second that each client_id can do set by Google.  rclone already has a
high quota and I will continue to make sure it is high enough by
contacting Google.

It is strongly recommended to use your own client ID as the default rclone ID is heavily used. If you have multiple services running, it is recommended to use an API key for each service. The default Google quota is 10 transactions per second so it is recommended to stay under that number as if you use more than that, it will cause rclone to rate limit and make things slower.

Here is how to create your own Google Drive client ID for rclone:

1. Log into the [Google API
Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) with your Google
account. It doesn't matter what Google account you use. (It need not
be the same account as the Google Drive you want to access)

2. Select a project or create a new project.

3. Under "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" search for "Drive", and enable the
"Google Drive API".

4. Click "Credentials" in the left-side panel (not "Create
credentials", which opens the wizard).

5. If you already configured an "Oauth Consent Screen", then skip
to the next step; if not, click on "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN" button 
(near the top right corner of the right panel), then select "External"
and click on "CREATE"; on the next screen, enter an "Application name"
("rclone" is OK); enter "User Support Email" (your own email is OK); 
enter "Developer Contact Email" (your own email is OK); then click on
"Save" (all other data is optional). You will also have to add [some scopes](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth),
including
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/docs`
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` in order to be able to edit,
create and delete files with RClone. 
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly` which you may also want to add.
  - If you want to add all at once, comma separated it would be `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/docs,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly`.
6. After adding scopes, click
"Save and continue" to add test users. Be sure to add your own account to
the test users. Once you've added yourself as a test user and saved the
changes, click again on "Credentials" on the left panel to go back to
the "Credentials" screen.

   (PS: if you are a GSuite user, you could also select "Internal" instead
of "External" above, but this will restrict API use to Google Workspace 
users in your organisation). 

7.  Click on the "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" button at the top of the screen,
then select "OAuth client ID".

8. Choose an application type of "Desktop app" and click "Create". (the default name is fine)

9. It will show you a client ID and client secret. Make a note of these.
   
   (If you selected "External" at Step 5 continue to Step 9. 
   If you chose "Internal" you don't need to publish and can skip straight to
   Step 10 but your destination drive must be part of the same Google Workspace.)

10. Go to "Oauth consent screen" and then click "PUBLISH APP" button and confirm.
   You will also want to add yourself as a test user.

11. Provide the noted client ID and client secret to rclone.

Be aware that, due to the "enhanced security" recently introduced by
Google, you are theoretically expected to "submit your app for verification"
and then wait a few weeks(!) for their response; in practice, you can go right
ahead and use the client ID and client secret with rclone, the only issue will
be a very scary confirmation screen shown when you connect via your browser 
for rclone to be able to get its token-id (but as this only happens during 
the remote configuration, it's not such a big deal). Keeping the application in
"Testing" will work as well, but the limitation is that any grants will expire
after a week, which can be annoying to refresh constantly. If, for whatever
reason, a short grant time is not a problem, then keeping the application in
testing mode would also be sufficient.

(Thanks to @balazer on github for these instructions.)

Sometimes, creation of an OAuth consent in Google API Console fails due to an error message
“The request failed because changes to one of the field of the resource is not supported”.
As a convenient workaround, the necessary Google Drive API key can be created on the
[Python Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python) page.
Just push the Enable the Drive API button to receive the Client ID and Secret.
Note that it will automatically create a new project in the API Console.

#  Google Photos

The rclone backend for [Google Photos](https://www.google.com/photos/about/) is
a specialized backend for transferring photos and videos to and from
Google Photos.

**NB** The Google Photos API which rclone uses has quite a few
limitations, so please read the [limitations section](#limitations)
carefully to make sure it is suitable for your use.

## Configuration

The initial setup for google cloud storage involves getting a token from Google Photos
which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Google Photos
   \ "google photos"
[snip]
Storage> google photos
** See help for google photos backend at: https://rclone.org/googlephotos/ **

Google Application Client Id
Leave blank normally.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
client_id> 
Google Application Client Secret
Leave blank normally.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
client_secret> 
Set to make the Google Photos backend read only.

If you choose read only then rclone will only request read only access
to your photos, otherwise rclone will request full access.
Enter a boolean value (true or false). Press Enter for the default ("false").
read_only> 
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> n
Remote config
Use web browser to automatically authenticate rclone with remote?
 * Say Y if the machine running rclone has a web browser you can use
 * Say N if running rclone on a (remote) machine without web browser access
If not sure try Y. If Y failed, try N.
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code

*** IMPORTANT: All media items uploaded to Google Photos with rclone
*** are stored in full resolution at original quality.  These uploads
*** will count towards storage in your Google Account.

Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: google photos
- token: {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"2019-06-28T17:38:04.644930156+01:00"}
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if using web browser to automatically 
authenticate. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this
may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all the albums in your photos

    rclone lsd remote:album

Make a new album

    rclone mkdir remote:album/newAlbum

List the contents of an album

    rclone ls remote:album/newAlbum

Sync `/home/local/images` to the Google Photos, removing any excess
files in the album.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/image remote:album/newAlbum

### Layout

As Google Photos is not a general purpose cloud storage system, the
backend is laid out to help you navigate it.

The directories under `media` show different ways of categorizing the
media.  Each file will appear multiple times.  So if you want to make
a backup of your google photos you might choose to backup
`remote:media/by-month`.  (**NB** `remote:media/by-day` is rather slow
at the moment so avoid for syncing.)

Note that all your photos and videos will appear somewhere under
`media`, but they may not appear under `album` unless you've put them
into albums.

```
/
- upload
    - file1.jpg
    - file2.jpg
    - ...
- media
    - all
        - file1.jpg
        - file2.jpg

                - file1.jpg
                - ...
            - 2000-02
                - file2.jpg
                - ...
        - ...
    - by-day
        - 2000
            - 2000-01-01
                - file1.jpg
                - ...
            - 2000-01-02
                - file2.jpg
                - ...
        - ...
- album
    - album name
    - album name/sub
- shared-album
    - album name
    - album name/sub
- feature
    - favorites
        - file1.jpg
        - file2.jpg
```

There are two writable parts of the tree, the `upload` directory and
sub directories of the `album` directory.

The `upload` directory is for uploading files you don't want to put
into albums. This will be empty to start with and will contain the
files you've uploaded for one rclone session only, becoming empty
again when you restart rclone. The use case for this would be if you
have a load of files you just want to once off dump into Google
Photos. For repeated syncing, uploading to `album` will work better.

Directories within the `album` directory are also writeable and you
may create new directories (albums) under `album`.  If you copy files
with a directory hierarchy in there then rclone will create albums
with the `/` character in them.  For example if you do

    rclone copy /path/to/images remote:album/images

and the images directory contains

```
images
    - file1.jpg
    dir
        file2.jpg
    dir2
        dir3
            file3.jpg
```

Then rclone will create the following albums with the following files in

- images
    - file1.jpg
- images/dir
    - file2.jpg
- images/dir2/dir3
    - file3.jpg

This means that you can use the `album` path pretty much like a normal
filesystem and it is a good target for repeated syncing.

The `shared-album` directory shows albums shared with you or by you.
This is similar to the Sharing tab in the Google Photos web interface.

#### --gphotos-client-secret

OAuth Client Secret.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

- Config:      client_secret
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_CLIENT_SECRET
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gphotos-read-only

Set to make the Google Photos backend read only.

If you choose read only then rclone will only request read only access
to your photos, otherwise rclone will request full access.

Properties:

- Config:      read_only
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_READ_ONLY
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to google photos (Google Photos).

#### --gphotos-token

OAuth Access Token as a JSON blob.

Properties:

- Config:      token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gphotos-auth-url

Auth server URL.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

Properties:

- Config:      auth_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_AUTH_URL
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gphotos-token-url

Token server url.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

Properties:

- Config:      token_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_TOKEN_URL
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --gphotos-read-size

Set to read the size of media items.

Normally rclone does not read the size of media items since this takes
another transaction.  This isn't necessary for syncing.  However
rclone mount needs to know the size of files in advance of reading
them, so setting this flag when using rclone mount is recommended if
you want to read the media.

Properties:

- Config:      read_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_READ_SIZE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gphotos-start-year

Year limits the photos to be downloaded to those which are uploaded after the given year.

Properties:

- Config:      start_year
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_START_YEAR
- Type:        int
- Default:     2000

#### --gphotos-include-archived

Also view and download archived media.

By default, rclone does not request archived media. Thus, when syncing,
archived media is not visible in directory listings or transferred.

Note that media in albums is always visible and synced, no matter
their archive status.

With this flag, archived media are always visible in directory
listings and transferred.

Without this flag, archived media will not be visible in directory
listings and won't be transferred.

Properties:

- Config:      include_archived
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_INCLUDE_ARCHIVED
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gphotos-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,CrLf,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --gphotos-batch-mode

Upload file batching sync|async|off.

This sets the batch mode used by rclone.

This has 3 possible values

- off - no batching
- sync - batch uploads and check completion (default)
- async - batch upload and don't check completion

Rclone will close any outstanding batches when it exits which may make
a delay on quit.


Properties:

- Config:      batch_mode
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_BATCH_MODE
- Type:        string
- Default:     "sync"

#### --gphotos-batch-size

Max number of files in upload batch.

This sets the batch size of files to upload. It has to be less than 50.

By default this is 0 which means rclone will calculate the batch size
depending on the setting of batch_mode.

- batch_mode: async - default batch_size is 50
- batch_mode: sync - default batch_size is the same as --transfers
- batch_mode: off - not in use

Rclone will close any outstanding batches when it exits which may make
a delay on quit.

Setting this is a great idea if you are uploading lots of small files
as it will make them a lot quicker. You can use --transfers 32 to
maximise throughput.


Properties:

- Config:      batch_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_BATCH_SIZE
- Type:        int
- Default:     0

#### --gphotos-batch-timeout

Max time to allow an idle upload batch before uploading.

If an upload batch is idle for more than this long then it will be
uploaded.

The default for this is 0 which means rclone will choose a sensible
default based on the batch_mode in use.

- batch_mode: async - default batch_timeout is 10s
- batch_mode: sync - default batch_timeout is 1s
- batch_mode: off - not in use


Properties:

- Config:      batch_timeout
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_BATCH_TIMEOUT
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     0s

#### --gphotos-batch-commit-timeout

Max time to wait for a batch to finish committing

Properties:

- Config:      batch_commit_timeout
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_BATCH_COMMIT_TIMEOUT
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     10m0s

#### --gphotos-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false



## Limitations

Only images and videos can be uploaded.  If you attempt to upload non
videos or images or formats that Google Photos doesn't understand,
rclone will upload the file, then Google Photos will give an error
when it is put turned into a media item.

Note that all media items uploaded to Google Photos through the API
are stored in full resolution at "original quality" and **will** count
towards your storage quota in your Google Account.  The API does
**not** offer a way to upload in "high quality" mode..

`rclone about` is not supported by the Google Photos backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
See [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

### Downloading Images

When Images are downloaded this strips EXIF location (according to the
docs and my tests).  This is a limitation of the Google Photos API and
is covered by [bug #112096115](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/112096115).

**The current google API does not allow photos to be downloaded at original resolution.  This is very important if you are, for example, relying on "Google Photos" as a backup of your photos.  You will not be able to use rclone to redownload original images.  You could use 'google takeout' to recover the original photos as a last resort**

### Downloading Videos

When videos are downloaded they are downloaded in a really compressed
version of the video compared to downloading it via the Google Photos
web interface. This is covered by [bug #113672044](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/113672044).

### Duplicates

If a file name is duplicated in a directory then rclone will add the
file ID into its name.  So two files called `file.jpg` would then
appear as `file {123456}.jpg` and `file {ABCDEF}.jpg` (the actual IDs
are a lot longer alas!).

If you upload the same image (with the same binary data) twice then
Google Photos will deduplicate it.  However it will retain the
filename from the first upload which may confuse rclone.  For example
if you uploaded an image to `upload` then uploaded the same image to
`album/my_album` the filename of the image in `album/my_album` will be
what it was uploaded with initially, not what you uploaded it with to
`album`.  In practise this shouldn't cause too many problems.

### Modification times

The date shown of media in Google Photos is the creation date as
determined by the EXIF information, or the upload date if that is not
known.

This is not changeable by rclone and is not the modification date of
the media on local disk.  This means that rclone cannot use the dates
from Google Photos for syncing purposes.

### Size

The Google Photos API does not return the size of media.  This means
that when syncing to Google Photos, rclone can only do a file
existence check.

It is possible to read the size of the media, but this needs an extra
HTTP HEAD request per media item so is **very slow** and uses up a lot of
transactions.  This can be enabled with the `--gphotos-read-size`
option or the `read_size = true` config parameter.

If you want to use the backend with `rclone mount` you may need to
enable this flag (depending on your OS and application using the
photos) otherwise you may not be able to read media off the mount.
You'll need to experiment to see if it works for you without the flag.

### Albums

Rclone can only upload files to albums it created. This is a
[limitation of the Google Photos API](https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/manage-albums).

Rclone can remove files it uploaded from albums it created only.

### Deleting files

Rclone can remove files from albums it created, but note that the
Google Photos API does not allow media to be deleted permanently so
this media will still remain. See [bug #109759781](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/109759781).

Rclone cannot delete files anywhere except under `album`.

### Deleting albums

The Google Photos API does not support deleting albums - see [bug #135714733](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/135714733).

#  Hasher

Hasher is a special overlay backend to create remotes which handle
checksums for other remotes. It's main functions include:
- Emulate hash types unimplemented by backends
- Cache checksums to help with slow hashing of large local or (S)FTP files
- Warm up checksum cache from external SUM files

## Getting started

To use Hasher, first set up the underlying remote following the configuration
instructions for that remote. You can also use a local pathname instead of
a remote. Check that your base remote is working.

Let's call the base remote `myRemote:path` here. Note that anything inside
`myRemote:path` will be handled by hasher and anything outside won't.
This means that if you are using a bucket based remote (S3, B2, Swift)
then you should put the bucket in the remote `s3:bucket`.

Now proceed to interactive or manual configuration.

### Interactive configuration

Run `rclone config`:
```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> Hasher1
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Handle checksums for other remotes
   \ "hasher"
[snip]
Storage> hasher
Remote to cache checksums for, like myremote:mypath.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
remote> myRemote:path
Comma separated list of supported checksum types.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("md5,sha1").
hashsums> md5
Maximum time to keep checksums in cache. 0 = no cache, off = cache forever.
max_age> off
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> n
Remote config
--------------------
[Hasher1]
type = hasher
remote = myRemote:path
hashsums = md5
max_age = off
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

### Manual configuration

Run `rclone config path` to see the path of current active config file,
usually `YOURHOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`.
Open it in your favorite text editor, find section for the base remote
and create new section for hasher like in the following examples:

```
[Hasher1]
type = hasher
remote = myRemote:path
hashes = md5
max_age = off

[Hasher2]
type = hasher
remote = /local/path
hashes = dropbox,sha1
max_age = 24h
```

Hasher takes basically the following parameters:
- `remote` is required,
- `hashes` is a comma separated list of supported checksums
   (by default `md5,sha1`),
- `max_age` - maximum time to keep a checksum value in the cache,
   `0` will disable caching completely,
   `off` will cache "forever" (that is until the files get changed).

Make sure the `remote` has `:` (colon) in. If you specify the remote without
a colon then rclone will use a local directory of that name. So if you use
a remote of `/local/path` then rclone will handle hashes for that directory.
If you use `remote = name` literally then rclone will put files
**in a directory called `name` located under current directory**.

## Usage

### Basic operations

Now you can use it as `Hasher2:subdir/file` instead of base remote.
Hasher will transparently update cache with new checksums when a file
is fully read or overwritten, like:
```
rclone copy External:path/file Hasher:dest/path

rclone cat Hasher:path/to/file > /dev/null
```

The way to refresh **all** cached checksums (even unsupported by the base backend)
for a subtree is to **re-download** all files in the subtree. For example,
use `hashsum --download` using **any** supported hashsum on the command line
(we just care to re-read):
```
rclone hashsum MD5 --download Hasher:path/to/subtree > /dev/null

rclone backend dump Hasher:path/to/subtree
```

You can print or drop hashsum cache using custom backend commands:
```
rclone backend dump Hasher:dir/subdir

rclone backend drop Hasher:
```

### Pre-Seed from a SUM File

Hasher supports two backend commands: generic SUM file `import` and faster
but less consistent `stickyimport`.

```
rclone backend import Hasher:dir/subdir SHA1 /path/to/SHA1SUM [--checkers 4]
```

Instead of SHA1 it can be any hash supported by the remote. The last argument
can point to either a local or an `other-remote:path` text file in SUM format.
The command will parse the SUM file, then walk down the path given by the
first argument, snapshot current fingerprints and fill in the cache entries
correspondingly.
- Paths in the SUM file are treated as relative to `hasher:dir/subdir`.
- The command will **not** check that supplied values are correct.
  You **must know** what you are doing.
- This is a one-time action. The SUM file will not get "attached" to the
  remote. Cache entries can still be overwritten later, should the object's
  fingerprint change.
- The tree walk can take long depending on the tree size. You can increase
  `--checkers` to make it faster. Or use `stickyimport` if you don't care
  about fingerprints and consistency.

```
rclone backend stickyimport hasher:path/to/data sha1 remote:/path/to/sum.sha1
```

`stickyimport` is similar to `import` but works much faster because it
does not need to stat existing files and skips initial tree walk.
Instead of binding cache entries to file fingerprints it creates _sticky_
entries bound to the file name alone ignoring size, modification time etc.
Such hash entries can be replaced only by `purge`, `delete`, `backend drop`
or by full re-read/re-write of the files.

## Implementation details (advanced)

This section explains how various rclone operations work on a hasher remote.

**Disclaimer. This section describes current implementation which can
change in future rclone versions!.**

### Hashsum command

The `rclone hashsum` (or `md5sum` or `sha1sum`) command will:

1. if requested hash is supported by lower level, just pass it.
2. if object size is below `auto_size` then download object and calculate
   _requested_ hashes on the fly.
3. if unsupported and the size is big enough, build object `fingerprint`
   (including size, modtime if supported, first-found _other_ hash if any).
4. if the strict match is found in cache for the requested remote, return
   the stored hash.
5. if remote found but fingerprint mismatched, then purge the entry and
   proceed to step 6.
6. if remote not found or had no requested hash type or after step 5:
   download object, calculate all _supported_ hashes on the fly and store
   in cache; return requested hash.

### Other operations

- any time a hash is requested, follow the logic from 1-4 from `hashsum` above
- whenever a file is uploaded or downloaded **in full**, capture the stream
  to calculate all supported hashes on the fly and update database
- server-side `move`  will update keys of existing cache entries
- `deletefile` will remove a single cache entry
- `purge` will remove all cache entries under the purged path

Note that setting `max_age = 0` will disable checksum caching completely.

If you set `max_age = off`, checksums in cache will never age, unless you
fully rewrite or delete the file.

### Cache storage

Cached checksums are stored as `bolt` database files under rclone cache
directory, usually `~/.cache/rclone/kv/`. Databases are maintained
one per _base_ backend, named like `BaseRemote~hasher.bolt`.
Checksums for multiple `alias`-es into a single base backend
will be stored in the single database. All local paths are treated as
aliases into the `local` backend (unless encrypted or chunked) and stored
in `~/.cache/rclone/kv/local~hasher.bolt`.
Databases can be shared between multiple rclone processes.

#  HDFS

[HDFS](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html) is a
distributed file-system, part of the [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) framework.

Paths are specified as `remote:` or `remote:path/to/dir`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[skip]
XX / Hadoop distributed file system
   \ "hdfs"
[skip]
Storage> hdfs
** See help for hdfs backend at: https://rclone.org/hdfs/ **

hadoop name node and port
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Connect to host namenode at port 8020
   \ "namenode:8020"

Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
Remote config
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: hdfs
- namenode: namenode.hadoop:8020
- username: root
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
hadoop               hdfs

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all the top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync the remote `directory` to `/home/local/directory`, deleting any excess files.

    rclone sync --interactive remote:directory /home/local/directory

### Setting up your own HDFS instance for testing

You may start with a [manual setup](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html)
or use the docker image from the tests:

If you want to build the docker image

```
git clone https://github.com/rclone/rclone.git
cd rclone/fstest/testserver/images/test-hdfs
docker build --rm -t rclone/test-hdfs .
```

Or you can just use the latest one pushed

```
docker run --rm --name "rclone-hdfs" -p 127.0.0.1:9866:9866 -p 127.0.0.1:8020:8020 --hostname "rclone-hdfs" rclone/test-hdfs
```

**NB** it need few seconds to startup.

For this docker image the remote needs to be configured like this:

```
[remote]
type = hdfs
namenode = 127.0.0.1:8020
username = root
```

You can stop this image with `docker kill rclone-hdfs` (**NB** it does not use volumes, so all data
uploaded will be lost.)

### Modification times

Time accurate to 1 second is stored.

### Checksum

No checksums are implemented.

### Usage information

You can use the `rclone about remote:` command which will display filesystem size and current usage.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| :         | 0x3A  | ：           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8).

- No server-side `Move` or `DirMove`.
- Checksums not implemented.

#  HiDrive

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

The initial setup for hidrive involves getting a token from HiDrive
which you need to do in your browser.
`rclone config` walks you through it.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

**You should be aware that OAuth-tokens can be used to access your account
and hence should not be shared with other persons.**
See the [below section](#keeping-your-tokens-safe) for more information.

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from HiDrive. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.
The webserver runs on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/`.
If local port `53682` is protected by a firewall you may need to temporarily
unblock the firewall to complete authorization.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your HiDrive root folder

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your HiDrive filesystem

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a HiDrive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Keeping your tokens safe

Any OAuth-tokens will be stored by rclone in the remote's configuration file as unencrypted text.
Anyone can use a valid refresh-token to access your HiDrive filesystem without knowing your password.
Therefore you should make sure no one else can access your configuration.

It is possible to encrypt rclone's configuration file.
You can find information on securing your configuration file by viewing the [configuration encryption docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#configuration-encryption).

### Invalid refresh token

As can be verified [here](https://developer.hidrive.com/basics-flows/),
each `refresh_token` (for Native Applications) is valid for 60 days.
If used to access HiDrivei, its validity will be automatically extended.

This means that if you

  * Don't use the HiDrive remote for 60 days

then rclone will return an error which includes a text
that implies the refresh token is *invalid* or *expired*.

To fix this you will need to authorize rclone to access your HiDrive account again.

Using

    rclone config reconnect remote:

the process is very similar to the process of initial setup exemplified before.

### Modification times and hashes

HiDrive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1 second.

HiDrive supports [its own hash type](https://static.hidrive.com/dev/0001)
which is used to verify the integrity of file contents after successful transfers.

### Restricted filename characters

HiDrive cannot store files or folders that include
`/` (0x2F) or null-bytes (0x00) in their name.
Any other characters can be used in the names of files or folders.
Additionally, files or folders cannot be named either of the following: `.` or `..`

Therefore rclone will automatically replace these characters,
if files or folders are stored or accessed with such names.

You can read about how this filename encoding works in general
[here](overview/#restricted-filenames).

Keep in mind that HiDrive only supports file or folder names
with a length of 255 characters or less.

### Transfers

HiDrive limits file sizes per single request to a maximum of 2 GiB.
To allow storage of larger files and allow for better upload performance,
the hidrive backend will use a chunked transfer for files larger than 96 MiB.
Rclone will upload multiple parts/chunks of the file at the same time.
Chunks in the process of being uploaded are buffered in memory,
so you may want to restrict this behaviour on systems with limited resources.

You can customize this behaviour using the following options:

* `chunk_size`: size of file parts
* `upload_cutoff`: files larger or equal to this in size will use a chunked transfer
* `upload_concurrency`: number of file-parts to upload at the same time

See the below section about configuration options for more details.

### Root folder

You can set the root folder for rclone.
This is the directory that rclone considers to be the root of your HiDrive.

Usually, you will leave this blank, and rclone will use the root of the account.

However, you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder hierarchy.

This works by prepending the contents of the `root_prefix` option
to any paths accessed by rclone.
For example, the following two ways to access the home directory are equivalent:

    rclone lsd --hidrive-root-prefix="/users/test/" remote:path

    rclone lsd remote:/users/test/path

See the below section about configuration options for more details.

### Directory member count

By default, rclone will know the number of directory members contained in a directory.
For example, `rclone lsd` uses this information.

The acquisition of this information will result in additional time costs for HiDrive's API.
When dealing with large directory structures, it may be desirable to circumvent this time cost,
especially when this information is not explicitly needed.
For this, the `disable_fetching_member_count` option can be used.

See the below section about configuration options for more details.

Any files larger than the configured cutoff (or files of unknown size) will be uploaded in chunks of this size.

The upper limit for this is 2147483647 bytes (about 2.000Gi).
That is the maximum amount of bytes a single upload-operation will support.
Setting this above the upper limit or to a negative value will cause uploads to fail.

Setting this to larger values may increase the upload speed at the cost of using more memory.
It can be set to smaller values smaller to save on memory.

Properties:

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HIDRIVE_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     48Mi

#### --hidrive-upload-cutoff

Cutoff/Threshold for chunked uploads.

The upper limit for this is 2147483647 bytes (about 2.000Gi).
That is the maximum amount of bytes a single upload-operation will support.
Setting this above the upper limit will cause uploads to fail.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HIDRIVE_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     96Mi

#### --hidrive-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for chunked uploads.

This is the upper limit for how many transfers for the same file are running concurrently.
Setting this above to a value smaller than 1 will cause uploads to deadlock.

If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links
and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing
this may help to speed up the transfers.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HIDRIVE_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     4

## Limitations

### Symbolic links

HiDrive is able to store symbolic links (*symlinks*) by design,
for example, when unpacked from a zip archive.

There exists no direct mechanism to manage native symlinks in remotes.
As such this implementation has chosen to ignore any native symlinks present in the remote.
rclone will not be able to access or show any symlinks stored in the hidrive-remote.
This means symlinks cannot be individually removed, copied, or moved,
except when removing, copying, or moving the parent folder.

*This does not affect the `.rclonelink`-files
that rclone uses to encode and store symbolic links.*

### Sparse files

It is possible to store sparse files in HiDrive.

Note that copying a sparse file will expand the holes
into null-byte (0x00) regions that will then consume disk space.
Likewise, when downloading a sparse file,
the resulting file will have null-byte regions in the place of file holes.

#  HTTP

The HTTP remote is a read only remote for reading files of a
webserver.  The webserver should provide file listings which rclone
will read and turn into a remote.  This has been tested with common
webservers such as Apache/Nginx/Caddy and will likely work with file
listings from most web servers.  (If it doesn't then please file an
issue, or send a pull request!)

Paths are specified as `remote:` or `remote:path`.

The `remote:` represents the configured [url](#http-url), and any path following
it will be resolved relative to this url, according to the URL standard. This
means with remote url `https://beta.rclone.org/branch` and path `fix`, the
resolved URL will be `https://beta.rclone.org/branch/fix`, while with path
`/fix` the resolved URL will be `https://beta.rclone.org/fix` as the absolute
path is resolved from the root of the domain.

If the path following the `remote:` ends with `/` it will be assumed to point
to a directory. If the path does not end with `/`, then a HEAD request is sent
and the response used to decide if it it is treated as a file or a directory
(run with `-vv` to see details). When [--http-no-head](#http-no-head) is
specified, a path without ending `/` is always assumed to be a file. If rclone
incorrectly assumes the path is a file, the solution is to specify the path with
ending `/`. When you know the path is a directory, ending it with `/` is always
better as it avoids the initial HEAD request.

To just download a single file it is easier to use
[copyurl](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copyurl/).

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First
run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / HTTP
   \ "http"
[snip]
Storage> http
URL of http host to connect to
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Connect to example.com
   \ "https://example.com"
url> https://beta.rclone.org
Remote config
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: http
- url: https://beta.rclone.org
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
remote               http

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all the top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync the remote `directory` to `/home/local/directory`, deleting any excess files.

    rclone sync --interactive remote:directory /home/local/directory

### Read only

This remote is read only - you can't upload files to an HTTP server.

### Modification times

Most HTTP servers store time accurate to 1 second.

### Checksum

No checksums are stored.

### Usage without a config file

Since the http remote only has one config parameter it is easy to use
without a config file:

    rclone lsd --http-url https://beta.rclone.org :http:

or:

    rclone lsd :http,url='https://beta.rclone.org':


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to http (HTTP).

#### --http-url

URL of HTTP host to connect to.

E.g. "https://example.com", or "https://user:pass@example.com" to use a username and password.

Properties:

- Config:      url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HTTP_URL
- Type:        string
- Required:    true

#### --http-no-escape

Do not escape URL metacharacters in path names.

Properties:

- Config:      no_escape
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HTTP_NO_ESCAPE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to http (HTTP).

#### --http-headers

Set HTTP headers for all transactions.

Use this to set additional HTTP headers for all transactions.

The input format is comma separated list of key,value pairs.  Standard
[CSV encoding](https://godoc.org/encoding/csv) may be used.

For example, to set a Cookie use 'Cookie,name=value', or '"Cookie","name=value"'.

You can set multiple headers, e.g. '"Cookie","name=value","Authorization","xxx"'.

Properties:

- Config:      headers
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HTTP_HEADERS
- Type:        CommaSepList
- Default:     

#### --http-no-slash

Set this if the site doesn't end directories with /.

Use this if your target website does not use / on the end of
directories.

A / on the end of a path is how rclone normally tells the difference
between files and directories.  If this flag is set, then rclone will
treat all files with Content-Type: text/html as directories and read
URLs from them rather than downloading them.

Note that this may cause rclone to confuse genuine HTML files with
directories.

Properties:

- Config:      no_slash
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HTTP_NO_SLASH
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --http-no-head

Don't use HEAD requests.

HEAD requests are mainly used to find file sizes in dir listing.
If your site is being very slow to load then you can try this option.
Normally rclone does a HEAD request for each potential file in a
directory listing to:

- find its size
- check it really exists
- check to see if it is a directory

If you set this option, rclone will not do the HEAD request. This will mean
that directory listings are much quicker, but rclone won't have the times or
sizes of any files, and some files that don't exist may be in the listing.

Properties:

- Config:      no_head
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HTTP_NO_HEAD
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --http-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HTTP_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

## Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the http backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the [backend](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command).

### set

Set command for updating the config parameters.

    rclone backend set remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This set command can be used to update the config parameters
for a running http backend.

Usage Examples:

    rclone backend set remote: [-o opt_name=opt_value] [-o opt_name2=opt_value2]
    rclone rc backend/command command=set fs=remote: [-o opt_name=opt_value] [-o opt_name2=opt_value2]
    rclone rc backend/command command=set fs=remote: -o url=https://example.com

The option keys are named as they are in the config file.

This rebuilds the connection to the http backend when it is called with
the new parameters. Only new parameters need be passed as the values
will default to those currently in use.

It doesn't return anything.




## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the HTTP backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) and [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Internet Archive

The Internet Archive backend utilizes Items on [archive.org](https://archive.org/)

Refer to [IAS3 API documentation](https://archive.org/services/docs/api/ias3.html) for the API this backend uses.

Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:item/path/to/dir`.

Unlike S3, listing up all items uploaded by you isn't supported.

Once you have made a remote, you can use it like this:

Make a new item

    rclone mkdir remote:item

List the contents of a item

    rclone ls remote:item

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote item, deleting any excess
files in the item.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:item

## Notes
Because of Internet Archive's architecture, it enqueues write operations (and extra post-processings) in a per-item queue. You can check item's queue at https://catalogd.archive.org/history/item-name-here . Because of that, all uploads/deletes will not show up immediately and takes some time to be available.
The per-item queue is enqueued to an another queue, Item Deriver Queue. [You can check the status of Item Deriver Queue here.](https://catalogd.archive.org/catalog.php?whereami=1) This queue has a limit, and it may block you from uploading, or even deleting. You should avoid uploading a lot of small files for better behavior.

You can optionally wait for the server's processing to finish, by setting non-zero value to `wait_archive` key.
By making it wait, rclone can do normal file comparison.
Make sure to set a large enough value (e.g. `30m0s` for smaller files) as it can take a long time depending on server's queue.

## About metadata
This backend supports setting, updating and reading metadata of each file.
The metadata will appear as file metadata on Internet Archive.
However, some fields are reserved by both Internet Archive and rclone.

The following are reserved by Internet Archive:
- `name`
- `source`
- `size`
- `md5`
- `crc32`
- `sha1`
- `format`
- `old_version`
- `viruscheck`
- `summation`

Trying to set values to these keys is ignored with a warning.
Only setting `mtime` is an exception. Doing so make it the identical behavior as setting ModTime.

rclone reserves all the keys starting with `rclone-`. Setting value for these keys will give you warnings, but values are set according to request.

If there are multiple values for a key, only the first one is returned.
This is a limitation of rclone, that supports one value per one key.
It can be triggered when you did a server-side copy.

Reading metadata will also provide custom (non-standard nor reserved) ones.

## Filtering auto generated files

The Internet Archive automatically creates metadata files after
upload. These can cause problems when doing an `rclone sync` as rclone
will try, and fail, to delete them. These metadata files are not
changeable, as they are created by the Internet Archive automatically.

These auto-created files can be excluded from the sync using [metadata
filtering](https://rclone.org/filtering/#metadata).

    rclone sync ... --metadata-exclude "source=metadata" --metadata-exclude "format=Metadata"

Which excludes from the sync any files which have the
`source=metadata` or `format=Metadata` flags which are added to
Internet Archive auto-created files.

## Configuration

Here is an example of making an internetarchive configuration.
Most applies to the other providers as well, any differences are described [below](#providers).

#  Jottacloud

Jottacloud is a cloud storage service provider from a Norwegian company, using its own datacenters
in Norway. In addition to the official service at [jottacloud.com](https://www.jottacloud.com/),
it also provides white-label solutions to different companies, such as:
* Telia
  * Telia Cloud (cloud.telia.se)
  * Telia Sky (sky.telia.no)
* Tele2
  * Tele2 Cloud (mittcloud.tele2.se)
* Onlime
  * Onlime Cloud Storage (onlime.dk)
* Elkjøp (with subsidiaries):
  * Elkjøp Cloud (cloud.elkjop.no)
  * Elgiganten Sweden (cloud.elgiganten.se)
  * Elgiganten Denmark (cloud.elgiganten.dk)
  * Giganti Cloud  (cloud.gigantti.fi)
  * ELKO Cloud (cloud.elko.is)

Most of the white-label versions are supported by this backend, although may require different
authentication setup - described below.

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Authentication types

Some of the whitelabel versions uses a different authentication method than the official service,
and you have to choose the correct one when setting up the remote.

### Standard authentication

The standard authentication method used by the official service (jottacloud.com), as well as
some of the whitelabel services, requires you to generate a single-use personal login token
from the account security settings in the service's web interface. Log in to your account,
go to "Settings" and then "Security", or use the direct link presented to you by rclone when
configuring the remote: <https://www.jottacloud.com/web/secure>. Scroll down to the section
"Personal login token", and click the "Generate" button. Note that if you are using a
whitelabel service you probably can't use the direct link, you need to find the same page in
their dedicated web interface, and also it may be in a different location than described above.

To access your account from multiple instances of rclone, you need to configure each of them
with a separate personal login token. E.g. you create a Jottacloud remote with rclone in one
location, and copy the configuration file to a second location where you also want to run
rclone and access the same remote. Then you need to replace the token for one of them, using
the [config reconnect](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_reconnect/) command, which
requires you to generate a new personal login token and supply as input. If you do not
do this, the token may easily end up being invalidated, resulting in both instances failing
with an error message something along the lines of:

    oauth2: cannot fetch token: 400 Bad Request
    Response: {"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"Stale token"}

When this happens, you need to replace the token as described above to be able to use your
remote again.

All personal login tokens you have taken into use will be listed in the web interface under
"My logged in devices", and from the right side of that list you can click the "X" button to
revoke individual tokens.

### Legacy authentication

If you are using one of the whitelabel versions (e.g. from Elkjøp) you may not have the option
to generate a CLI token. In this case you'll have to use the legacy authentication. To do this select
yes when the setup asks for legacy authentication and enter your username and password.
The rest of the setup is identical to the default setup.

### Telia Cloud authentication

Similar to other whitelabel versions Telia Cloud doesn't offer the option of creating a CLI token, and
additionally uses a separate authentication flow where the username is generated internally. To setup
rclone to use Telia Cloud, choose Telia Cloud authentication in the setup. The rest of the setup is
identical to the default setup.

### Tele2 Cloud authentication

As Tele2-Com Hem merger was completed this authentication can be used for former Com Hem Cloud and
Tele2 Cloud customers as no support for creating a CLI token exists, and additionally uses a separate
authentication flow where the username is generated internally. To setup rclone to use Tele2 Cloud,
choose Tele2 Cloud authentication in the setup. The rest of the setup is identical to the default setup.

### Onlime Cloud Storage authentication

Onlime has sold access to Jottacloud proper, while providing localized support to Danish Customers, but
have recently set up their own hosting, transferring their customers from Jottacloud servers to their
own ones.

This, of course, necessitates using their servers for authentication, but otherwise functionality and
architecture seems equivalent to Jottacloud.

To setup rclone to use Onlime Cloud Storage, choose Onlime Cloud authentication in the setup. The rest
of the setup is identical to the default setup.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote` with the default setup.  First run:

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Option Storage.
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.
[snip]
XX / Jottacloud
   \ (jottacloud)
[snip]
Storage> jottacloud
Edit advanced config?
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
Option config_type.
Select authentication type.
Choose a number from below, or type in an existing string value.
Press Enter for the default (standard).
   / Standard authentication.
 1 | Use this if you're a normal Jottacloud user.
   \ (standard)
   / Legacy authentication.
 2 | This is only required for certain whitelabel versions of Jottacloud and not recommended for normal users.
   \ (legacy)
   / Telia Cloud authentication.
 3 | Use this if you are using Telia Cloud.
   \ (telia)
   / Tele2 Cloud authentication.
 4 | Use this if you are using Tele2 Cloud.
   \ (tele2)
   / Onlime Cloud authentication.
 5 | Use this if you are using Onlime Cloud.
   \ (onlime)
config_type> 1
Personal login token.
Generate here: https://www.jottacloud.com/web/secure
Login Token> <your token here>
Use a non-standard device/mountpoint?
Choosing no, the default, will let you access the storage used for the archive
section of the official Jottacloud client. If you instead want to access the
sync or the backup section, for example, you must choose yes.
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> y
Option config_device.
The device to use. In standard setup the built-in Jotta device is used,
which contains predefined mountpoints for archive, sync etc. All other devices
are treated as backup devices by the official Jottacloud client. You may create
a new by entering a unique name.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own string value.
Press Enter for the default (DESKTOP-3H31129).
 1 > DESKTOP-3H31129
 2 > Jotta
config_device> 2
Option config_mountpoint.
The mountpoint to use for the built-in device Jotta.
The standard setup is to use the Archive mountpoint. Most other mountpoints
have very limited support in rclone and should generally be avoided.
Choose a number from below, or type in an existing string value.
Press Enter for the default (Archive).
 1 > Archive
 2 > Shared
 3 > Sync
config_mountpoint> 1
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: jottacloud
- configVersion: 1
- client_id: jottacli
- client_secret:
- tokenURL: https://id.jottacloud.com/auth/realms/jottacloud/protocol/openid-connect/token
- token: {........}
- username: 2940e57271a93d987d6f8a21
- device: Jotta
- mountpoint: Archive
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Jottacloud

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Jottacloud

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Jottacloud directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Devices and Mountpoints

The official Jottacloud client registers a device for each computer you install
it on, and shows them in the backup section of the user interface. For each
folder you select for backup it will create a mountpoint within this device.
A built-in device called Jotta is special, and contains mountpoints Archive,
Sync and some others, used for corresponding features in official clients.

With rclone you'll want to use the standard Jotta/Archive device/mountpoint in
most cases. However, you may for example want to access files from the sync or
backup functionality provided by the official clients, and rclone therefore
provides the option to select other devices and mountpoints during config.

You are allowed to create new devices and mountpoints. All devices except the
built-in Jotta device are treated as backup devices by official Jottacloud
clients, and the mountpoints on them are individual backup sets.

With the built-in Jotta device, only existing, built-in, mountpoints can be
selected. In addition to the mentioned Archive and Sync, it may contain
several other mountpoints such as: Latest, Links, Shared and Trash. All of
these are special mountpoints with a different internal representation than
the "regular" mountpoints. Rclone will only to a very limited degree support
them. Generally you should avoid these, unless you know what you are doing.

### --fast-list

This backend supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

Note that the implementation in Jottacloud always uses only a single
API request to get the entire list, so for large folders this could
lead to long wait time before the first results are shown.

Note also that with rclone version 1.58 and newer, information about
[MIME types](https://rclone.org/overview/#mime-type) and metadata item [utime](#metadata)
are not available when using `--fast-list`.

### Modification times and hashes

Jottacloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

Jottacloud supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the `--checksum`
flag.

Note that Jottacloud requires the MD5 hash before upload so if the
source does not have an MD5 checksum then the file will be cached
temporarily on disk (in location given by
[--temp-dir](https://rclone.org/docs/#temp-dir-dir)) before it is uploaded.
Small files will be cached in memory - see the
[--jottacloud-md5-memory-limit](#jottacloud-md5-memory-limit) flag.
When uploading from local disk the source checksum is always available,
so this does not apply. Starting with rclone version 1.52 the same is
true for encrypted remotes (in older versions the crypt backend would not
calculate hashes for uploads from local disk, so the Jottacloud
backend had to do it as described above).

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊          |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：          |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜          |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞          |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？          |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in XML strings.

### Deleting files

By default, rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files. They will be permanently
deleted automatically after 30 days. You may bypass the trash and permanently delete files immediately
by using the [--jottacloud-hard-delete](#jottacloud-hard-delete) flag, or set the equivalent environment variable.
Emptying the trash is supported by the [cleanup](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_cleanup/) command.

### Versions

Jottacloud supports file versioning. When rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a new version of it.
Currently rclone only supports retrieving the current version but older versions can be accessed via the Jottacloud Website.

Versioning can be disabled by `--jottacloud-no-versions` option. This is achieved by deleting the remote file prior to uploading
a new version. If the upload the fails no version of the file will be available in the remote.

### Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the `rclone about remote:`
command which will display your usage limit (unless it is unlimited)

## Limitations

Note that Jottacloud is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are quite a few characters that can't be in Jottacloud file names. Rclone will map these names to and from an identical
looking unicode equivalent. For example if a file has a ? in it will be mapped to ？ instead.

Jottacloud only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.

## Troubleshooting

Jottacloud exhibits some inconsistent behaviours regarding deleted files and folders which may cause Copy, Move and DirMove
operations to previously deleted paths to fail. Emptying the trash should help in such cases.

#  Koofr

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for Koofr involves creating an application password for
rclone. You can do that by opening the Koofr
[web application](https://app.koofr.net/app/admin/preferences/password),
giving the password a nice name like `rclone` and clicking on generate.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `koofr`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config

d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

You can choose to edit advanced config in order to enter your own service URL
if you use an on-premise or white label Koofr instance, or choose an alternative
mount instead of your primary storage.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Koofr

    rclone lsd koofr:

List all the files in your Koofr

    rclone ls koofr:

To copy a local directory to an Koofr directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source koofr:backup

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),

#  Mail.ru Cloud

[Mail.ru Cloud](https://cloud.mail.ru/) is a cloud storage provided by a Russian internet company [Mail.Ru Group](https://mail.ru). The official desktop client is [Disk-O:](https://disk-o.cloud/en), available on Windows and Mac OS.

## Features highlights

- Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`
- Files have a `last modified time` property, directories don't
- Deleted files are by default moved to the trash
- Files and directories can be shared via public links
- Partial uploads or streaming are not supported, file size must be known before upload
- Maximum file size is limited to 2G for a free account, unlimited for paid accounts
- Storage keeps hash for all files and performs transparent deduplication,
  the hash algorithm is a modified SHA1
- If a particular file is already present in storage, one can quickly submit file hash
  instead of long file upload (this optimization is supported by rclone)

## Configuration

Here is an example of making a mailru configuration.

First create a Mail.ru Cloud account and choose a tariff.

You will need to log in and create an app password for rclone. Rclone
**will not work** with your normal username and password - it will
give an error like `oauth2: server response missing access_token`.

- Click on your user icon in the top right
- Go to Security / "Пароль и безопасность"
- Click password for apps / "Пароли для внешних приложений"
- Add the password - give it a name - eg "rclone"
- Copy the password and use this password below - your normal login password won't work.

Now run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Mail.ru Cloud
   \ "mailru"
[snip]
Storage> mailru
User name (usually email)
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
user> username@mail.ru
Password

This must be an app password - rclone will not work with your normal
password. See the Configuration section in the docs for how to make an
app password.
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
y/g> y
Enter the password:

Confirm the password:
password:
Skip full upload if there is another file with same data hash.
This feature is called "speedup" or "put by hash". It is especially efficient
in case of generally available files like popular books, video or audio clips
[snip]
Enter a boolean value (true or false). Press Enter for the default ("true").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Enable
   \ "true"
 2 / Disable
   \ "false"
speedup_enable> 1
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> n
Remote config
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: mailru
- user: username@mail.ru
- pass: *** ENCRYPTED ***
- speedup_enable: true
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Configuration of this backend does not require a local web browser.
You can use the configured backend as shown below:

See top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote path, deleting any
excess files in the path.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:directory

### Modification times and hashes

Files support a modification time attribute with up to 1 second precision.
Directories do not have a modification time, which is shown as "Jan 1 1970".

File hashes are supported, with a custom Mail.ru algorithm based on SHA1.
If file size is less than or equal to the SHA1 block size (20 bytes),
its hash is simply its data right-padded with zero bytes.
Hashes of a larger file is computed as a SHA1 of the file data
bytes concatenated with a decimal representation of the data length.

### Emptying Trash

Removing a file or directory actually moves it to the trash, which is not
visible to rclone but can be seen in a web browser. The trashed file
still occupies part of total quota. If you wish to empty your trash
and free some quota, you can use the `rclone cleanup remote:` command,
which will permanently delete all your trashed files.
This command does not take any path arguments.

### Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the `rclone about remote:`
command which will display your usage limit (quota) and the current usage.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊          |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：          |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜          |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞          |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？          |
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼          |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to mailru (Mail.ru Cloud).

#### --mailru-client-id

OAuth Client Id.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

- Config:      client_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MAILRU_CLIENT_ID
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --mailru-client-secret

OAuth Client Secret.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

- Config:      client_secret
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MAILRU_CLIENT_SECRET
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --mailru-user

Properties:

- Config:      user
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MAILRU_USER
- Type:        string
- Required:    true

#### --mailru-pass

Password.

This must be an app password - rclone will not work with your normal
password. See the Configuration section in the docs for how to make an
app password.


**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

Properties:

- Config:      pass

- Type:        string
- Required:    true

#### --mailru-speedup-enable

Skip full upload if there is another file with same data hash.

This feature is called "speedup" or "put by hash". It is especially efficient
in case of generally available files like popular books, video or audio clips,
because files are searched by hash in all accounts of all mailru users.
It is meaningless and ineffective if source file is unique or encrypted.
Please note that rclone may need local memory and disk space to calculate
content hash in advance and decide whether full upload is required.
Also, if rclone does not know file size in advance (e.g. in case of
streaming or partial uploads), it will not even try this optimization.

Properties:

- Config:      speedup_enable
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MAILRU_SPEEDUP_ENABLE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

## Limitations

File size limits depend on your account. A single file size is limited by 2G
for a free account and unlimited for paid tariffs. Please refer to the Mail.ru
site for the total uploaded size limits.

Note that Mailru is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

#  Mega

[Mega](https://mega.nz/) is a cloud storage and file hosting service
known for its security feature where all files are encrypted locally
before they are uploaded. This prevents anyone (including employees of
Mega) from accessing the files without knowledge of the key used for
encryption.

This is an rclone backend for Mega which supports the file transfer
features of Mega using the same client side encryption.

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

**NOTE:** The encryption keys need to have been already generated after a regular login
via the browser, otherwise attempting to use the credentials in `rclone` will fail.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Mega

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Mega

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Mega directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modification times and hashes

Mega does not support modification times or hashes yet.

### Restricted filename characters

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Duplicated files

Mega can have two files with exactly the same name and path (unlike a
normal file system).

Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.

Use `rclone dedupe` to fix duplicated files.

### Failure to log-in

#### Object not found

If you are connecting to your Mega remote for the first time, 
to test access and synchronization, you may receive an error such as 

```
Failed to create file system for "my-mega-remote:": 
couldn't login: Object (typically, node or user) not found
```

The diagnostic steps often recommended in the [rclone forum](https://forum.rclone.org/search?q=mega)
start with the **MEGAcmd** utility. Note that this refers to 
the official C++ command from https://github.com/meganz/MEGAcmd 
and not the go language built command from t3rm1n4l/megacmd 
that is no longer maintained. 

Follow the instructions for installing MEGAcmd and try accessing 
your remote as they recommend. You can establish whether or not 
you can log in using MEGAcmd, and obtain diagnostic information 
to help you, and search or work with others in the forum. 

```
MEGA CMD> login me@example.com
Password:
Fetching nodes ...
Loading transfers from local cache
Login complete as me@example.com
me@example.com:/$ 
```

Note that some have found issues with passwords containing special 
characters. If you can not log on with rclone, but MEGAcmd logs on 
just fine, then consider changing your password temporarily to 
pure alphanumeric characters, in case that helps.


#### Repeated commands blocks access

Mega remotes seem to get blocked (reject logins) under "heavy use".
We haven't worked out the exact blocking rules but it seems to be
related to fast paced, successive rclone commands.

For example, executing this command 90 times in a row `rclone link
remote:file` will cause the remote to become "blocked". This is not an
abnormal situation, for example if you wish to get the public links of
a directory with hundred of files...  After more or less a week, the
remote will remote accept rclone logins normally again.

You can mitigate this issue by mounting the remote it with `rclone
mount`. This will log-in when mounting and a log-out when unmounting
only. You can also run `rclone rcd` and then use `rclone rc` to run
the commands over the API to avoid logging in each time.

Rclone does not currently close mega sessions (you can see them in the
web interface), however closing the sessions does not solve the issue.

If you space rclone commands by 3 seconds it will avoid blocking the
remote. We haven't identified the exact blocking rules, so perhaps one
could execute the command 80 times without waiting and avoid blocking
by waiting 3 seconds, then continuing...

Note that this has been observed by trial and error and might not be
set in stone.

Other tools seem not to produce this blocking effect, as they use a
different working approach (state-based, using sessionIDs instead of
log-in) which isn't compatible with the current stateless rclone
approach.

Note that once blocked, the use of other tools (such as megacmd) is
not a sure workaround: following megacmd login times have been
observed in succession for blocked remote: 7 minutes, 20 min, 30min, 30
min, 30min. Web access looks unaffected though.

Investigation is continuing in relation to workarounds based on
timeouts, pacers, retrials and tpslimits - if you discover something
relevant, please post on the forum.

So, if rclone was working nicely and suddenly you are unable to log-in
and you are sure the user and the password are correct, likely you
have got the remote blocked for a while.


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to mega (Mega).

#### --mega-user

User name.

Properties:

- Config:      user
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MEGA_USER
- Type:        string
- Required:    true

#### --mega-pass

Password.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

Properties:

- Config:      pass
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MEGA_PASS
- Type:        string
- Required:    true

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to mega (Mega).

#### --mega-debug

Output more debug from Mega.

If this flag is set (along with -vv) it will print further debugging
information from the mega backend.

Properties:

- Config:      debug
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MEGA_DEBUG
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --mega-hard-delete

Delete files permanently rather than putting them into the trash.

Normally the mega backend will put all deletions into the trash rather
than permanently deleting them.  If you specify this then rclone will
permanently delete objects instead.

Properties:

- Config:      hard_delete
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MEGA_HARD_DELETE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --mega-use-https

Use HTTPS for transfers.

MEGA uses plain text HTTP connections by default.
Some ISPs throttle HTTP connections, this causes transfers to become very slow.
Enabling this will force MEGA to use HTTPS for all transfers.
HTTPS is normally not necessary since all data is already encrypted anyway.
Enabling it will increase CPU usage and add network overhead.

Properties:

- Config:      use_https
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MEGA_USE_HTTPS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --mega-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MEGA_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --mega-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MEGA_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false



### Process `killed`

On accounts with large files or something else, memory usage can significantly increase when executing list/sync instructions. When running on cloud providers (like AWS with EC2), check if the instance type has sufficient memory/CPU to execute the commands. Use the resource monitoring tools to inspect after sending the commands. Look [at this issue](https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-with-mega-appears-to-work-only-in-some-accounts/40233/4).

## Limitations

This backend uses the [go-mega go library](https://github.com/t3rm1n4l/go-mega) which is an opensource
go library implementing the Mega API. There doesn't appear to be any
documentation for the mega protocol beyond the [mega C++ SDK](https://github.com/meganz/sdk) source code
so there are likely quite a few errors still remaining in this library.

Mega allows duplicate files which may confuse rclone.

#  Memory

The memory backend is an in RAM backend. It does not persist its
data - use the local backend for that.

The memory backend behaves like a bucket-based remote (e.g. like
s3). Because it has no parameters you can just use it with the
`:memory:` remote name.

## Configuration

You can configure it as a remote like this with `rclone config` too if
you want to:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Memory
   \ "memory"
[snip]
Storage> memory
** See help for memory backend at: https://rclone.org/memory/ **

Remote config

Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: memory
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Because the memory backend isn't persistent it is most useful for
testing or with an rclone server or rclone mount, e.g.

    rclone mount :memory: /mnt/tmp
    rclone serve webdav :memory:
    rclone serve sftp :memory:

### Modification times and hashes

The memory backend supports MD5 hashes and modification times accurate to 1 nS.

### Restricted filename characters

The memory backend replaces the [default restricted characters
set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters).


### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to memory (In memory object storage system.).

#### --memory-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MEMORY_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false



#  Akamai NetStorage

Paths are specified as `remote:`
You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:/path/to/dir`.
If you have a CP code you can use that as the folder after the domain such as \<domain>\/\<cpcode>\/\<internal directories within cpcode>.

For example, this is commonly configured with or without a CP code:
* **With a CP code**. `[your-domain-prefix]-nsu.akamaihd.net/123456/subdirectory/`
* **Without a CP code**. `[your-domain-prefix]-nsu.akamaihd.net`


See all buckets
   rclone lsd remote:
The initial setup for Netstorage involves getting an account and secret. Use `rclone config` to walk you through the setup process.

## Configuration

Here's an example of how to make a remote called `ns1`.

1. To begin the interactive configuration process, enter this command:

```
rclone config
```

2. Type `n` to create a new remote.

```
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
q) Quit config
e/n/d/q> n
```

3. For this example, enter `ns1` when you reach the name> prompt.

```
name> ns1
```

4. Enter `netstorage` as the type of storage to configure.

```
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
XX / NetStorage
   \ "netstorage"
Storage> netstorage
```

5. Select between the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. Most users should choose HTTPS, which is the default. HTTP is provided primarily for debugging purposes.


```
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / HTTP protocol
   \ "http"
 2 / HTTPS protocol
   \ "https"
protocol> 1
```

6. Specify your NetStorage host, CP code, and any necessary content paths using this format: `<domain>/<cpcode>/<content>/`

```
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
host> baseball-nsu.akamaihd.net/123456/content/
```

7. Set the netstorage account name
```
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
account> username
```

8. Set the Netstorage account secret/G2O key which will be used for authentication purposes. Select the `y` option to set your own password then enter your secret.
Note: The secret is stored in the `rclone.conf` file with hex-encoded encryption.

```
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
y/g> y
Enter the password:
password:
Confirm the password:
password:
```

9. View the summary and confirm your remote configuration.

```
[ns1]
type = netstorage
protocol = http
host = baseball-nsu.akamaihd.net/123456/content/
account = username
secret = *** ENCRYPTED ***
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

This remote is called `ns1` and can now be used.

## Example operations

Get started with rclone and NetStorage with these examples. For additional rclone commands, visit https://rclone.org/commands/.

### See contents of a directory in your project

    rclone lsd ns1:/974012/testing/

### Sync the contents local with remote

    rclone sync . ns1:/974012/testing/

### Upload local content to remote
    rclone copy notes.txt ns1:/974012/testing/

### Delete content on remote
    rclone delete ns1:/974012/testing/notes.txt

### Move or copy content between CP codes.

Your credentials must have access to two CP codes on the same remote. You can't perform operations between different remotes.

    rclone move ns1:/974012/testing/notes.txt ns1:/974450/testing2/

## Features

### Symlink Support

The Netstorage backend changes the rclone `--links, -l` behavior. When uploading, instead of creating the .rclonelink file, use the "symlink" API in order to create the corresponding symlink on the remote. The .rclonelink file will not be created, the upload will be intercepted and only the symlink file that matches the source file name with no suffix will be created on the remote.

This will effectively allow commands like copy/copyto, move/moveto and sync to upload from local to remote and download from remote to local directories with symlinks. Due to internal rclone limitations, it is not possible to upload an individual symlink file to any remote backend. You can always use the "backend symlink" command to create a symlink on the NetStorage server, refer to "symlink" section below.

Individual symlink files on the remote can be used with the commands like "cat" to print the destination name, or "delete" to delete symlink, or copy, copy/to and move/moveto to download from the remote to local. Note: individual symlink files on the remote should be specified including the suffix .rclonelink.

**Note**: No file with the suffix .rclonelink should ever exist on the server since it is not possible to actually upload/create a file with .rclonelink suffix with rclone, it can only exist if it is manually created through a non-rclone method on the remote.

### Implicit vs. Explicit Directories

With NetStorage, directories can exist in one of two forms:

1. **Explicit Directory**. This is an actual, physical directory that you have created in a storage group.
2. **Implicit Directory**. This refers to a directory within a path that has not been physically created. For example, during upload of a file, nonexistent subdirectories can be specified in the target path. NetStorage creates these as "implicit." While the directories aren't physically created, they exist implicitly and the noted path is connected with the uploaded file.

Rclone will intercept all file uploads and mkdir commands for the NetStorage remote and will explicitly issue the mkdir command for each directory in the uploading path. This will help with the interoperability with the other Akamai services such as SFTP and the Content Management Shell (CMShell). Rclone will not guarantee correctness of operations with implicit directories which might have been created as a result of using an upload API directly.

### `--fast-list` / ListR support

NetStorage remote supports the ListR feature by using the "list" NetStorage API action to return a lexicographical list of all objects within the specified CP code, recursing into subdirectories as they're encountered.

* **Rclone will use the ListR method for some commands by default**. Commands such as `lsf -R` will use ListR by default. To disable this, include the `--disable listR` option to use the non-recursive method of listing objects.

* **Rclone will not use the ListR method for some commands**. Commands such as `sync` don't use ListR by default. To force using the ListR method, include the  `--fast-list` option.

There are pros and cons of using the ListR method, refer to [rclone documentation](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list). In general, the sync command over an existing deep tree on the remote will run faster with the "--fast-list" flag but with extra memory usage as a side effect. It might also result in higher CPU utilization but the whole task can be completed faster.

**Note**: There is a known limitation that "lsf -R" will display number of files in the directory and directory size as -1 when ListR method is used. The workaround is to pass "--disable listR" flag if these numbers are important in the output.

### Purge

NetStorage remote supports the purge feature by using the "quick-delete" NetStorage API action. The quick-delete action is disabled by default for security reasons and can be enabled for the account through the Akamai portal. Rclone will first try to use quick-delete action for the purge command and if this functionality is disabled then will fall back to a standard delete method.

**Note**: Read the [NetStorage Usage API](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/webhelp/netstorage/netstorage-http-api-developer-guide/GUID-15836617-9F50-405A-833C-EA2556756A30.html) for considerations when using "quick-delete". In general, using quick-delete method will not delete the tree immediately and objects targeted for quick-delete may still be accessible.

See the [backend](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command).

### du

Return disk usage information for a specified directory

    rclone backend du remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

The usage information returned, includes the targeted directory as well as all
files stored in any sub-directories that may exist.

### symlink

You can create a symbolic link in ObjectStore with the symlink action.

    rclone backend symlink remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

the object that will be the target of the symlink (for example, /links/mylink).
Include the file extension for the object, if applicable.
`rclone backend symlink <src> <path>`



#  Microsoft Azure Blob Storage

Paths are specified as `remote:container` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g.
`remote:container/path/to/dir`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of making a Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
configuration.  For a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See all containers

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new container

    rclone mkdir remote:container

List the contents of a container

    rclone ls remote:container

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote container, deleting any excess
files in the container.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:container

### --fast-list

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

### Modification times and hashes

The modification time is stored as metadata on the object with the
`mtime` key.  It is stored using RFC3339 Format time with nanosecond
precision.  The metadata is supplied during directory listings so
there is no performance overhead to using it.

If you wish to use the Azure standard `LastModified` time stored on
the object as the modified time, then use the `--use-server-modtime`
flag. Note that rclone can't set `LastModified`, so using the
`--update` flag when syncing is recommended if using
`--use-server-modtime`.

MD5 hashes are stored with blobs. However blobs that were uploaded in
chunks only have an MD5 if the source remote was capable of MD5
hashes, e.g. the local disk.

### Performance

When uploading large files, increasing the value of
`--azureblob-upload-concurrency` will increase performance at the cost
of using more memory. The default of 16 is set quite conservatively to
use less memory. It maybe be necessary raise it to 64 or higher to
fully utilize a 1 GBit/s link with a single file transfer.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| /         | 0x2F  | ／           |
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |

File names can also not end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| .         | 0x2E  | ．          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Authentication {#authentication}

There are a number of ways of supplying credentials for Azure Blob
Storage. Rclone tries them in the order of the sections below.

#### Env Auth

If the `env_auth` config parameter is `true` then rclone will pull
credentials from the environment or runtime.

It tries these authentication methods in this order:

1. Environment Variables
2. Managed Service Identity Credentials
3. Azure CLI credentials (as used by the az tool)

These are described in the following sections

##### Env Auth: 1. Environment Variables

If `env_auth` is set and environment variables are present rclone
authenticates a service principal with a secret or certificate, or a
user with a password, depending on which environment variable are set.
It reads configuration from these variables, in the following order:

1. Service principal with client secret
    - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: the service principal's client ID
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: one of the service principal's client secrets
2. Service principal with certificate
    - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: the service principal's client ID
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH`: path to a PEM or PKCS12 certificate file including the private key.
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`: (optional) password for the certificate file.
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_SEND_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN`: (optional) Specifies whether an authentication request will include an x5c header to support subject name / issuer based authentication. When set to "true" or "1", authentication requests include the x5c header.
3. User with username and password
    - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: (optional) tenant to authenticate in. Defaults to "organizations".
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: client ID of the application the user will authenticate to
    - `AZURE_USERNAME`: a username (usually an email address)
    - `AZURE_PASSWORD`: the user's password
4. Workload Identity
    - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Tenant to authenticate in.
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Client ID of the application the user will authenticate to.
    - `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`: Path to projected service account token file.
    - `AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST`: Authority of an Azure Active Directory endpoint (default: login.microsoftonline.com).


##### Env Auth: 2. Managed Service Identity Credentials

When using Managed Service Identity if the VM(SS) on which this
program is running has a system-assigned identity, it will be used by
default. If the resource has no system-assigned but exactly one
user-assigned identity, the user-assigned identity will be used by
default.

If the resource has multiple user-assigned identities you will need to
unset `env_auth` and set `use_msi` instead. See the [`use_msi`
section](#use_msi).

##### Env Auth: 3. Azure CLI credentials (as used by the az tool)

Credentials created with the `az` tool can be picked up using `env_auth`.

For example if you were to login with a service principal like this:

    az login --service-principal -u XXX -p XXX --tenant XXX

Then you could access rclone resources like this:

    rclone lsf :azureblob,env_auth,account=ACCOUNT:CONTAINER

Or

    rclone lsf --azureblob-env-auth --azureblob-account=ACCOUNT :azureblob:CONTAINER

Which is analogous to using the `az` tool:

    az storage blob list --container-name CONTAINER --account-name ACCOUNT --auth-mode login

#### Account and Shared Key

This is the most straight forward and least flexible way.  Just fill
in the `account` and `key` lines and leave the rest blank.

#### SAS URL

This can be an account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL.

To use it leave `account` and `key` blank and fill in `sas_url`.

An account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL can be obtained
from the Azure portal or the Azure Storage Explorer.  To get a
container level SAS URL right click on a container in the Azure Blob
explorer in the Azure portal.

If you use a container level SAS URL, rclone operations are permitted
only on a particular container, e.g.

    rclone ls azureblob:container

You can also list the single container from the root. This will only
show the container specified by the SAS URL.

    $ rclone lsd azureblob:
    container/

Note that you can't see or access any other containers - this will
fail

    rclone ls azureblob:othercontainer

Container level SAS URLs are useful for temporarily allowing third
parties access to a single container or putting credentials into an
untrusted environment such as a CI build server.

#### Service principal with client secret

If these variables are set, rclone will authenticate with a service principal with a client secret.

- `tenant`: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.
- `client_id`: the service principal's client ID
- `client_secret`: one of the service principal's client secrets

The credentials can also be placed in a file using the
`service_principal_file` configuration option.

#### Service principal with certificate

If these variables are set, rclone will authenticate with a service principal with certificate.

- `tenant`: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.
- `client_id`: the service principal's client ID
- `client_certificate_path`: path to a PEM or PKCS12 certificate file including the private key.
- `client_certificate_password`: (optional) password for the certificate file.
- `client_send_certificate_chain`: (optional) Specifies whether an authentication request will include an x5c header to support subject name / issuer based authentication. When set to "true" or "1", authentication requests include the x5c header.

**NB** `client_certificate_password` must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

#### User with username and password

If these variables are set, rclone will authenticate with username and password.

- `tenant`: (optional) tenant to authenticate in. Defaults to "organizations".
- `client_id`: client ID of the application the user will authenticate to
- `username`: a username (usually an email address)
- `password`: the user's password

Microsoft doesn't recommend this kind of authentication, because it's
less secure than other authentication flows. This method is not
interactive, so it isn't compatible with any form of multi-factor
authentication, and the application must already have user or admin
consent. This credential can only authenticate work and school
accounts; it can't authenticate Microsoft accounts.

**NB** `password` must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

#### Managed Service Identity Credentials {#use_msi}

If `use_msi` is set then managed service identity credentials are
used. This authentication only works when running in an Azure service.
`env_auth` needs to be unset to use this.

However if you have multiple user identities to choose from these must
be explicitly specified using exactly one of the `msi_object_id`,
`msi_client_id`, or `msi_mi_res_id` parameters.

If none of `msi_object_id`, `msi_client_id`, or `msi_mi_res_id` is
set, this is is equivalent to using `env_auth`.

#### Anonymous {#anonymous}

If you want to access resources with public anonymous access then set
`account` only. You can do this without making an rclone config:

    rclone lsf :azureblob,account=ACCOUNT:CONTAINER


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to azureblob (Microsoft Azure Blob Storage).

#### --azureblob-account

Azure Storage Account Name.

- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --azureblob-service-principal-file

Path to file containing credentials for use with a service principal.

Leave blank normally. Needed only if you want to use a service principal instead of interactive login.

    $ az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "<name>" \
      --role "Storage Blob Data Owner" \
      --scopes "/subscriptions/<subscription>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account>/blobServices/default/containers/<container>" \
      > azure-principal.json

See ["Create an Azure service principal"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli) and ["Assign an Azure role for access to blob data"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-cli) pages for more details.

It may be more convenient to put the credentials directly into the
rclone config file under the `client_id`, `tenant` and `client_secret`
keys instead of setting `service_principal_file`.


Properties:

- Config:      service_principal_file
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_FILE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --azureblob-use-msi

Use a managed service identity to authenticate (only works in Azure).

When true, use a [managed service identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/)
to authenticate to Azure Storage instead of a SAS token or account key.

If the VM(SS) on which this program is running has a system-assigned identity, it will
be used by default. If the resource has no system-assigned but exactly one user-assigned identity,
the user-assigned identity will be used by default. If the resource has multiple user-assigned
identities, the identity to use must be explicitly specified using exactly one of the msi_object_id,
msi_client_id, or msi_mi_res_id parameters.

Properties:

- Config:      use_msi
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_USE_MSI
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --azureblob-msi-object-id

Object ID of the user-assigned MSI to use, if any.

Leave blank if msi_client_id or msi_mi_res_id specified.

Properties:

- Config:      msi_object_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_MSI_OBJECT_ID
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --azureblob-msi-client-id

Object ID of the user-assigned MSI to use, if any.

Leave blank if msi_object_id or msi_mi_res_id specified.

Properties:

- Config:      msi_client_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_MSI_CLIENT_ID
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --azureblob-msi-mi-res-id

Azure resource ID of the user-assigned MSI to use, if any.

Leave blank if msi_client_id or msi_object_id specified.

Properties:

- Config:      msi_mi_res_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_MSI_MI_RES_ID
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --azureblob-use-emulator

Uses local storage emulator if provided as 'true'.

Leave blank if using real azure storage endpoint.

Properties:

- Config:      use_emulator
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_USE_EMULATOR
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --azureblob-endpoint

Endpoint for the service.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

- Config:      endpoint
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ENDPOINT
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --azureblob-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload (<= 256 MiB) (deprecated).

Properties:

- Config:      upload_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --azureblob-chunk-size

Upload chunk size.

Note that this is stored in memory and there may be up to
"--transfers" * "--azureblob-upload-concurrency" chunks stored at once
in memory.

Properties:

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     4Mi

#### --azureblob-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently.

If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed
links and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then
increasing this may help to speed up the transfers.

In tests, upload speed increases almost linearly with upload
concurrency. For example to fill a gigabit pipe it may be necessary to
raise this to 64. Note that this will use more memory.

Note that chunks are stored in memory and there may be up to
"--transfers" * "--azureblob-upload-concurrency" chunks stored at once
in memory.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     16

#### --azureblob-list-chunk

Size of blob list.

This sets the number of blobs requested in each listing chunk. Default
is the maximum, 5000. "List blobs" requests are permitted 2 minutes
per megabyte to complete. If an operation is taking longer than 2
minutes per megabyte on average, it will time out (
[source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/setting-timeouts-for-blob-service-operations#exceptions-to-default-timeout-interval)
). This can be used to limit the number of blobs items to return, to
avoid the time out.

Properties:

- Config:      list_chunk
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_LIST_CHUNK
- Type:        int
- Default:     5000

#### --azureblob-access-tier

Access tier of blob: hot, cool, cold or archive.

Archived blobs can be restored by setting access tier to hot, cool or
cold. Leave blank if you intend to use default access tier, which is
set at account level

If there is no "access tier" specified, rclone doesn't apply any tier.
rclone performs "Set Tier" operation on blobs while uploading, if objects
are not modified, specifying "access tier" to new one will have no effect.
If blobs are in "archive tier" at remote, trying to perform data transfer
operations from remote will not be allowed. User should first restore by
tiering blob to "Hot", "Cool" or "Cold".

Properties:

- Config:      access_tier
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ACCESS_TIER
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --azureblob-archive-tier-delete

Delete archive tier blobs before overwriting.

Archive tier blobs cannot be updated. So without this flag, if you
attempt to update an archive tier blob, then rclone will produce the
error:

    can't update archive tier blob without --azureblob-archive-tier-delete

With this flag set then before rclone attempts to overwrite an archive
tier blob, it will delete the existing blob before uploading its
replacement.  This has the potential for data loss if the upload fails
(unlike updating a normal blob) and also may cost more since deleting
archive tier blobs early may be chargable.


Properties:

- Config:      archive_tier_delete
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ARCHIVE_TIER_DELETE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --azureblob-disable-checksum

Don't store MD5 checksum with object metadata.

Normally rclone will calculate the MD5 checksum of the input before
uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great
for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files
to start uploading.

Properties:

- Config:      disable_checksum
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_DISABLE_CHECKSUM
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --azureblob-memory-pool-flush-time

How often internal memory buffer pools will be flushed. (no longer used)

Properties:

- Config:      memory_pool_flush_time
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_MEMORY_POOL_FLUSH_TIME
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --azureblob-memory-pool-use-mmap

Whether to use mmap buffers in internal memory pool. (no longer used)

Properties:

- Config:      memory_pool_use_mmap
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_MEMORY_POOL_USE_MMAP
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --azureblob-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8

#### --azureblob-public-access

Public access level of a container: blob or container.

Properties:

- Config:      public_access
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_PUBLIC_ACCESS
- Type:        string
- Required:    false
- Examples:
    - ""
        - The container and its blobs can be accessed only with an authorized request.
        - It's a default value.
    - "blob"
        - Blob data within this container can be read via anonymous request.
    - "container"
        - Allow full public read access for container and blob data.

#### --azureblob-directory-markers

Upload an empty object with a trailing slash when a new directory is created

Empty folders are unsupported for bucket based remotes, this option
creates an empty object ending with "/", to persist the folder.

This object also has the metadata "hdi_isfolder = true" to conform to
the Microsoft standard.
 

Properties:

- Config:      directory_markers
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_DIRECTORY_MARKERS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --azureblob-no-check-container

If set, don't attempt to check the container exists or create it.

This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions
rclone does if you know the container exists already.


Properties:

- Config:      no_check_container
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_NO_CHECK_CONTAINER
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --azureblob-no-head-object

If set, do not do HEAD before GET when getting objects.

Properties:

- Config:      no_head_object
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_NO_HEAD_OBJECT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --azureblob-delete-snapshots

Set to specify how to deal with snapshots on blob deletion.

Properties:

- Config:      delete_snapshots
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_DELETE_SNAPSHOTS
- Type:        string
- Required:    false
- Choices:
    - ""
        - By default, the delete operation fails if a blob has snapshots
    - "include"
        - Specify 'include' to remove the root blob and all its snapshots
    - "only"
        - Specify 'only' to remove only the snapshots but keep the root blob.

#### --azureblob-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false



### Custom upload headers

You can set custom upload headers with the `--header-upload` flag. 

- Cache-Control
- Content-Disposition
- Content-Encoding
- Content-Language
- Content-Type

Eg `--header-upload "Content-Type: text/potato"`

## Limitations

MD5 sums are only uploaded with chunked files if the source has an MD5
sum.  This will always be the case for a local to azure copy.

`rclone about` is not supported by the Microsoft Azure Blob storage backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) and [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

## Azure Storage Emulator Support

You can run rclone with the storage emulator (usually _azurite_).

To do this, just set up a new remote with `rclone config` following
the instructions in the introduction and set `use_emulator` in the
advanced settings as `true`. You do not need to provide a default
account name nor an account key. But you can override them in the
`account` and `key` options. (Prior to v1.61 they were hard coded to
_azurite_'s `devstoreaccount1`.)

Also, if you want to access a storage emulator instance running on a
different machine, you can override the `endpoint` parameter in the
advanced settings, setting it to
`http(s)://<host>:<port>/devstoreaccount1`
(e.g. `http://10.254.2.5:10000/devstoreaccount1`).

#  Microsoft Azure Files Storage

Paths are specified as `remote:` You may put subdirectories in too,
e.g. `remote:path/to/dir`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of making a Microsoft Azure Files Storage
configuration.  For a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Microsoft Azure Files Storage
   \ "azurefiles"
[snip]

Option account.
Azure Storage Account Name.
Set this to the Azure Storage Account Name in use.
Leave blank to use SAS URL or connection string, otherwise it needs to be set.
If this is blank and if env_auth is set it will be read from the
environment variable `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` if possible.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
account> account_name

Option share_name.
Azure Files Share Name.
This is required and is the name of the share to access.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
share_name> share_name

Option env_auth.
Read credentials from runtime (environment variables, CLI or MSI).
See the [authentication docs](/azurefiles#authentication) for full info.
Enter a boolean value (true or false). Press Enter for the default (false).
env_auth> 

Option key.
Storage Account Shared Key.
Leave blank to use SAS URL or connection string.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
key> base64encodedkey==

Option sas_url.
SAS URL.
Leave blank if using account/key or connection string.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
sas_url> 

Option connection_string.
Azure Files Connection String.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
connection_string> 
[snip]

Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: azurefiles
- account: account_name
- share_name: share_name
- key: base64encodedkey==
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> 
```

Once configured you can use rclone.

See all files in the top level:

    rclone lsf remote:

Make a new directory in the root:

    rclone mkdir remote:dir

Recursively List the contents:

    rclone ls remote:

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote directory, deleting any
excess files in the directory.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:dir

### Modified time

The modified time is stored as Azure standard `LastModified` time on
files

### Performance

When uploading large files, increasing the value of
`--azurefiles-upload-concurrency` will increase performance at the cost
of using more memory. The default of 16 is set quite conservatively to
use less memory. It maybe be necessary raise it to 64 or higher to
fully utilize a 1 GBit/s link with a single file transfer.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊          |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：          |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜          |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞          |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？          |
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼          |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜          |

File names can also not end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| .         | 0x2E  | ．          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Hashes

MD5 hashes are stored with files. Not all files will have MD5 hashes
as these have to be uploaded with the file.

### Authentication {#authentication}

There are a number of ways of supplying credentials for Azure Files
Storage. Rclone tries them in the order of the sections below.

#### Env Auth

If the `env_auth` config parameter is `true` then rclone will pull
credentials from the environment or runtime.

It tries these authentication methods in this order:

1. Environment Variables
2. Managed Service Identity Credentials
3. Azure CLI credentials (as used by the az tool)

These are described in the following sections

##### Env Auth: 1. Environment Variables

If `env_auth` is set and environment variables are present rclone
authenticates a service principal with a secret or certificate, or a
user with a password, depending on which environment variable are set.
It reads configuration from these variables, in the following order:

1. Service principal with client secret
    - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: the service principal's client ID
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: one of the service principal's client secrets
2. Service principal with certificate
    - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: the service principal's client ID
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH`: path to a PEM or PKCS12 certificate file including the private key.
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`: (optional) password for the certificate file.
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_SEND_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN`: (optional) Specifies whether an authentication request will include an x5c header to support subject name / issuer based authentication. When set to "true" or "1", authentication requests include the x5c header.
3. User with username and password
    - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: (optional) tenant to authenticate in. Defaults to "organizations".
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: client ID of the application the user will authenticate to
    - `AZURE_USERNAME`: a username (usually an email address)
    - `AZURE_PASSWORD`: the user's password
4. Workload Identity
    - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Tenant to authenticate in.
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Client ID of the application the user will authenticate to.
    - `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`: Path to projected service account token file.
    - `AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST`: Authority of an Azure Active Directory endpoint (default: login.microsoftonline.com).


##### Env Auth: 2. Managed Service Identity Credentials

When using Managed Service Identity if the VM(SS) on which this
program is running has a system-assigned identity, it will be used by
default. If the resource has no system-assigned but exactly one
user-assigned identity, the user-assigned identity will be used by
default.

If the resource has multiple user-assigned identities you will need to
unset `env_auth` and set `use_msi` instead. See the [`use_msi`
section](#use_msi).

##### Env Auth: 3. Azure CLI credentials (as used by the az tool)

Credentials created with the `az` tool can be picked up using `env_auth`.

For example if you were to login with a service principal like this:

    az login --service-principal -u XXX -p XXX --tenant XXX

Then you could access rclone resources like this:

    rclone lsf :azurefiles,env_auth,account=ACCOUNT:

Or

    rclone lsf --azurefiles-env-auth --azurefiles-account=ACCOUNT :azurefiles:

#### Account and Shared Key

This is the most straight forward and least flexible way.  Just fill
in the `account` and `key` lines and leave the rest blank.

#### SAS URL

To use it leave `account`, `key` and `connection_string` blank and fill in `sas_url`.

#### Connection String

To use it leave `account`, `key` and "sas_url" blank and fill in `connection_string`.

#### Service principal with client secret

If these variables are set, rclone will authenticate with a service principal with a client secret.

- `tenant`: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.
- `client_id`: the service principal's client ID
- `client_secret`: one of the service principal's client secrets

The credentials can also be placed in a file using the
`service_principal_file` configuration option.

#### Service principal with certificate

If these variables are set, rclone will authenticate with a service principal with certificate.

- `tenant`: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its "directory" ID.
- `client_id`: the service principal's client ID
- `client_certificate_path`: path to a PEM or PKCS12 certificate file including the private key.
- `client_certificate_password`: (optional) password for the certificate file.
- `client_send_certificate_chain`: (optional) Specifies whether an authentication request will include an x5c header to support subject name / issuer based authentication. When set to "true" or "1", authentication requests include the x5c header.

**NB** `client_certificate_password` must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

#### User with username and password

If these variables are set, rclone will authenticate with username and password.

- `tenant`: (optional) tenant to authenticate in. Defaults to "organizations".
- `client_id`: client ID of the application the user will authenticate to
- `username`: a username (usually an email address)
- `password`: the user's password

Microsoft doesn't recommend this kind of authentication, because it's
less secure than other authentication flows. This method is not
interactive, so it isn't compatible with any form of multi-factor
authentication, and the application must already have user or admin
consent. This credential can only authenticate work and school
accounts; it can't authenticate Microsoft accounts.

**NB** `password` must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

#### Managed Service Identity Credentials {#use_msi}

If `use_msi` is set then managed service identity credentials are
used. This authentication only works when running in an Azure service.
`env_auth` needs to be unset to use this.

However if you have multiple user identities to choose from these must
be explicitly specified using exactly one of the `msi_object_id`,
`msi_client_id`, or `msi_mi_res_id` parameters.

If none of `msi_object_id`, `msi_client_id`, or `msi_mi_res_id` is
set, this is is equivalent to using `env_auth`.

**NB** this section needs updating for Azure Files - pull requests appreciated!

It may be more convenient to put the credentials directly into the
rclone config file under the `client_id`, `tenant` and `client_secret`
keys instead of setting `service_principal_file`.


Properties:

- Config:      service_principal_file
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREFILES_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_FILE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --azurefiles-use-msi

Use a managed service identity to authenticate (only works in Azure).

When true, use a [managed service identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/)
to authenticate to Azure Storage instead of a SAS token or account key.

If the VM(SS) on which this program is running has a system-assigned identity, it will
be used by default. If the resource has no system-assigned but exactly one user-assigned identity,
the user-assigned identity will be used by default. If the resource has multiple user-assigned
identities, the identity to use must be explicitly specified using exactly one of the msi_object_id,
msi_client_id, or msi_mi_res_id parameters.

Properties:

- Config:      use_msi
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREFILES_USE_MSI
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --azurefiles-msi-object-id

Object ID of the user-assigned MSI to use, if any.

Leave blank if msi_client_id or msi_mi_res_id specified.

Properties:

- Config:      msi_object_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREFILES_MSI_OBJECT_ID
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --azurefiles-msi-client-id

Object ID of the user-assigned MSI to use, if any.

Leave blank if msi_object_id or msi_mi_res_id specified.

Properties:

- Config:      msi_client_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREFILES_MSI_CLIENT_ID
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --azurefiles-msi-mi-res-id

Azure resource ID of the user-assigned MSI to use, if any.

Leave blank if msi_client_id or msi_object_id specified.

Properties:

- Config:      msi_mi_res_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREFILES_MSI_MI_RES_ID
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --azurefiles-endpoint

Endpoint for the service.

Leave blank normally.

Properties:

- Config:      endpoint
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREFILES_ENDPOINT
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --azurefiles-chunk-size

Upload chunk size.

Note that this is stored in memory and there may be up to
"--transfers" * "--azurefile-upload-concurrency" chunks stored at once
in memory.

Properties:

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREFILES_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     4Mi

#### --azurefiles-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently.

If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed
links and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then
increasing this may help to speed up the transfers.

Note that chunks are stored in memory and there may be up to
"--transfers" * "--azurefile-upload-concurrency" chunks stored at once
in memory.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREFILES_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     16

#### --azurefiles-max-stream-size

Max size for streamed files.

Azure files needs to know in advance how big the file will be. When
rclone doesn't know it uses this value instead.

This will be used when rclone is streaming data, the most common uses are:

- Uploading files with `--vfs-cache-mode off` with `rclone mount`
- Using `rclone rcat`
- Copying files with unknown length

You will need this much free space in the share as the file will be this size temporarily.


Properties:

- Config:      max_stream_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREFILES_MAX_STREAM_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     10Gi

- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --azurefiles-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREFILES_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false



### Custom upload headers

You can set custom upload headers with the `--header-upload` flag. 

- Cache-Control
- Content-Disposition
- Content-Encoding
- Content-Language
- Content-Type

Eg `--header-upload "Content-Type: text/potato"`

## Limitations

MD5 sums are only uploaded with chunked files if the source has an MD5
sum.  This will always be the case for a local to azure copy.

#  Microsoft OneDrive

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for OneDrive involves getting a token from
Microsoft which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks
you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote

```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Microsoft. This only runs from the moment it
opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification
code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require
you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your OneDrive

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your OneDrive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an OneDrive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Getting your own Client ID and Key

rclone uses a default Client ID when talking to OneDrive, unless a custom `client_id` is specified in the config.
The default Client ID and Key are shared by all rclone users when performing requests.

You may choose to create and use your own Client ID, in case the default one does not work well for you. 
For example, you might see throttling.

#### Creating Client ID for OneDrive Personal

To create your own Client ID, please follow these steps:

1. Open https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade and then click `New registration`.
2. Enter a name for your app, choose account type `Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)`, select `Web` in `Redirect URI`, then type (do not copy and paste) `http://localhost:53682/` and click Register. Copy and keep the `Application (client) ID` under the app name for later use.
3. Under `manage` select `Certificates & secrets`, click `New client secret`. Enter a description (can be anything) and set `Expires` to 24 months. Copy and keep that secret _Value_ for later use (you _won't_ be able to see this value afterwards).
4. Under `manage` select `API permissions`, click `Add a permission` and select `Microsoft Graph` then select `delegated permissions`.
5. Search and select the following permissions: `Files.Read`, `Files.ReadWrite`, `Files.Read.All`, `Files.ReadWrite.All`, `offline_access`, `User.Read` and `Sites.Read.All` (if custom access scopes are configured, select the permissions accordingly). Once selected click `Add permissions` at the bottom.

Now the application is complete. Run `rclone config` to create or edit a OneDrive remote.
Supply the app ID and password as Client ID and Secret, respectively. rclone will walk you through the remaining steps.

The access_scopes option allows you to configure the permissions requested by rclone.
See [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#files-permissions) for more information about the different scopes.

The `Sites.Read.All` permission is required if you need to [search SharePoint sites when configuring the remote](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5883). However, if that permission is not assigned, you need to exclude `Sites.Read.All` from your access scopes or set `disable_site_permission` option to true in the advanced options.

#### Creating Client ID for OneDrive Business

The steps for OneDrive Personal may or may not work for OneDrive Business, depending on the security settings of the organization.
A common error is that the publisher of the App is not verified.

You may try to [verify you account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/publisher-verification-overview), or try to limit the App to your organization only, as shown below.

1. Make sure to create the App with your business account.
2. Follow the steps above to create an App. However, we need a different account type here: `Accounts in this organizational directory only (*** - Single tenant)`. Note that you can also change the account type after creating the App.
3. Find the [tenant ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenant) of your organization.
4. In the rclone config, set `auth_url` to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/YOUR_TENANT_ID/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`.
5. In the rclone config, set `token_url` to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/YOUR_TENANT_ID/oauth2/v2.0/token`.

Note: If you have a special region, you may need a different host in step 4 and 5. Here are [some hints](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/bc23bf11db1c78c6ebbf8ea538fbebf7058b4176/backend/onedrive/onedrive.go#L86).


### Modification times and hashes

OneDrive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.  These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

OneDrive Personal, OneDrive for Business and Sharepoint Server support
[QuickXorHash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/code-snippets/quickxorhash).

Before rclone 1.62 the default hash for Onedrive Personal was `SHA1`.
For rclone 1.62 and above the default for all Onedrive backends is
`QuickXorHash`.

Starting from July 2023 `SHA1` support is being phased out in Onedrive
Personal in favour of `QuickXorHash`. If necessary the
`--onedrive-hash-type` flag (or `hash_type` config option) can be used
to select `SHA1` during the transition period if this is important
your workflow.

For all types of OneDrive you can use the `--checksum` flag.

### --fast-list

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

This must be enabled with the `--onedrive-delta` flag (or `delta =
true` in the config file) as it can cause performance degradation.

It does this by using the delta listing facilities of OneDrive which
returns all the files in the remote very efficiently. This is much
more efficient than listing directories recursively and is Microsoft's
recommended way of reading all the file information from a drive.

This can be useful with `rclone mount` and [rclone rc vfs/refresh
recursive=true](https://rclone.org/rc/#vfs-refresh)) to very quickly fill the mount with
information about all the files.

The API used for the recursive listing (`ListR`) only supports listing
from the root of the drive. This will become increasingly inefficient
the further away you get from the root as rclone will have to discard
files outside of the directory you are using.

Some commands (like `rclone lsf -R`) will use `ListR` by default - you
can turn this off with `--disable ListR` if you need to.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊          |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：          |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜          |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞          |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？          |
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼          |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜          |

File names can also not end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |
| .         | 0x2E  | ．          |

File names can also not begin with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the first character in the name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |
| ~         | 0x7E  | ～          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Deleting files

Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.  Microsoft
doesn't provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to empty the
trash, so you will have to do that with one of Microsoft's apps or via
the OneDrive website.

- Config:      auth_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_AUTH_URL
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --onedrive-token-url

Token server url.

- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_TOKEN_URL
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --onedrive-chunk-size

Chunk size to upload files with - must be multiple of 320k (327,680 bytes).

Above this size files will be chunked - must be multiple of 320k (327,680 bytes) and
should not exceed 250M (262,144,000 bytes) else you may encounter \"Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.InvalidClientQueryException: The request message is too big.\"
Note that the chunks will be buffered into memory.

Properties:

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     10Mi

#### --onedrive-drive-id

The ID of the drive to use.

Properties:

- Config:      drive_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_DRIVE_ID
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --onedrive-drive-type

The type of the drive (personal | business | documentLibrary).

Properties:

- Config:      drive_type
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_DRIVE_TYPE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --onedrive-root-folder-id

ID of the root folder.

This isn't normally needed, but in special circumstances you might
know the folder ID that you wish to access but not be able to get
there through a path traversal.


Properties:

- Config:      root_folder_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --onedrive-access-scopes

Set scopes to be requested by rclone.

Choose or manually enter a custom space separated list with all scopes, that rclone should request.


Properties:

- Config:      access_scopes
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_ACCESS_SCOPES
- Type:        SpaceSepList
- Default:     Files.Read Files.ReadWrite Files.Read.All Files.ReadWrite.All Sites.Read.All offline_access
- Examples:
    - "Files.Read Files.ReadWrite Files.Read.All Files.ReadWrite.All Sites.Read.All offline_access"
        - Read and write access to all resources
    - "Files.Read Files.Read.All Sites.Read.All offline_access"
        - Read only access to all resources
    - "Files.Read Files.ReadWrite Files.Read.All Files.ReadWrite.All offline_access"
        - Read and write access to all resources, without the ability to browse SharePoint sites. 
        - Same as if disable_site_permission was set to true

#### --onedrive-disable-site-permission

Disable the request for Sites.Read.All permission.

If set to true, you will no longer be able to search for a SharePoint site when
configuring drive ID, because rclone will not request Sites.Read.All permission.
Set it to true if your organization didn't assign Sites.Read.All permission to the
application, and your organization disallows users to consent app permission
request on their own.

Properties:

- Config:      disable_site_permission
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_DISABLE_SITE_PERMISSION
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --onedrive-expose-onenote-files

Set to make OneNote files show up in directory listings.

By default, rclone will hide OneNote files in directory listings because
operations like "Open" and "Update" won't work on them.  But this
behaviour may also prevent you from deleting them.  If you want to
delete OneNote files or otherwise want them to show up in directory
listing, set this option.

Properties:

- Config:      expose_onenote_files
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_EXPOSE_ONENOTE_FILES
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --onedrive-server-side-across-configs

Deprecated: use --server-side-across-configs instead.

Allow server-side operations (e.g. copy) to work across different onedrive configs.

This will work if you are copying between two OneDrive *Personal* drives AND the files to
copy are already shared between them. Additionally, it should also function for a user who
has access permissions both between Onedrive for *business* and *SharePoint* under the *same
tenant*, and between *SharePoint* and another *SharePoint* under the *same tenant*. In other
cases, rclone will fall back to normal copy (which will be slightly slower).

Properties:

- Config:      server_side_across_configs
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_SERVER_SIDE_ACROSS_CONFIGS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --onedrive-list-chunk

Size of listing chunk.

Properties:

- Config:      list_chunk
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_LIST_CHUNK
- Type:        int
- Default:     1000

#### --onedrive-no-versions

Remove all versions on modifying operations.

Onedrive for business creates versions when rclone uploads new files
overwriting an existing one and when it sets the modification time.

These versions take up space out of the quota.

This flag checks for versions after file upload and setting
modification time and removes all but the last version.

**NB** Onedrive personal can't currently delete versions so don't use
this flag there.


Properties:

- Config:      no_versions
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_NO_VERSIONS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --onedrive-hard-delete

Permanently delete files on removal.

Normally files will get sent to the recycle bin on deletion. Setting
this flag causes them to be permanently deleted. Use with care.

OneDrive personal accounts do not support the permanentDelete API,
it only applies to OneDrive for Business and SharePoint document libraries.


Properties:

- Config:      hard_delete
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_HARD_DELETE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --onedrive-link-scope

Set the scope of the links created by the link command.

Properties:

- Config:      link_scope
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_LINK_SCOPE
- Type:        string
- Default:     "anonymous"
- Examples:
    - "anonymous"
        - Anyone with the link has access, without needing to sign in.
        - This may include people outside of your organization.
        - Anonymous link support may be disabled by an administrator.
    - "organization"
        - Anyone signed into your organization (tenant) can use the link to get access.
        - Only available in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint.

#### --onedrive-link-type

Set the type of the links created by the link command.

Properties:

- Config:      link_type
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_LINK_TYPE
- Type:        string
- Default:     "view"
- Examples:
    - "view"
        - Creates a read-only link to the item.
    - "edit"
        - Creates a read-write link to the item.
    - "embed"
        - Creates an embeddable link to the item.

#### --onedrive-link-password

Set the password for links created by the link command.

At the time of writing this only works with OneDrive personal paid accounts.


Properties:

- Config:      link_password
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_LINK_PASSWORD
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --onedrive-hash-type

Specify the hash in use for the backend.

This specifies the hash type in use. If set to "auto" it will use the
default hash which is QuickXorHash.

Before rclone 1.62 an SHA1 hash was used by default for Onedrive
Personal. For 1.62 and later the default is to use a QuickXorHash for
all onedrive types. If an SHA1 hash is desired then set this option
accordingly.

From July 2023 QuickXorHash will be the only available hash for
both OneDrive for Business and OneDrive Personal.

This can be set to "none" to not use any hashes.

If the hash requested does not exist on the object, it will be
returned as an empty string which is treated as a missing hash by
rclone.


Properties:

- Config:      hash_type
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_HASH_TYPE
- Type:        string
- Default:     "auto"
- Examples:
    - "auto"
        - Rclone chooses the best hash
    - "quickxor"
        - QuickXor
    - "sha1"
        - SHA1
    - "sha256"
        - SHA256
    - "crc32"
        - CRC32
    - "none"
        - None - don't use any hashes

#### --onedrive-av-override

Allows download of files the server thinks has a virus.

The onedrive/sharepoint server may check files uploaded with an Anti
Virus checker. If it detects any potential viruses or malware it will
block download of the file.

In this case you will see a message like this

    server reports this file is infected with a virus - use --onedrive-av-override to download anyway: Infected (name of virus): 403 Forbidden: 

If you are 100% sure you want to download this file anyway then use
the --onedrive-av-override flag, or av_override = true in the config
file.


Properties:

- Config:      av_override
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_AV_OVERRIDE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --onedrive-delta

If set rclone will use delta listing to implement recursive listings.

If this flag is set the onedrive backend will advertise `ListR`
support for recursive listings.

Setting this flag speeds up these things greatly:

    rclone lsf -R onedrive:
    rclone size onedrive:
    rclone rc vfs/refresh recursive=true

**However** the delta listing API **only** works at the root of the
drive. If you use it not at the root then it recurses from the root
and discards all the data that is not under the directory you asked
for. So it will be correct but may not be very efficient.

This is why this flag is not set as the default.

As a rule of thumb if nearly all of your data is under rclone's root
directory (the `root/directory` in `onedrive:root/directory`) then
using this flag will be be a big performance win. If your data is
mostly not under the root then using this flag will be a big
performance loss.

It is recommended if you are mounting your onedrive at the root
(or near the root when using crypt) and using rclone `rc vfs/refresh`.


Properties:

- Config:      delta
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_DELTA
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --onedrive-metadata-permissions

Control whether permissions should be read or written in metadata.

Reading permissions metadata from files can be done quickly, but it
isn't always desirable to set the permissions from the metadata.


Properties:

- Config:      metadata_permissions
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_METADATA_PERMISSIONS
- Type:        Bits
- Default:     off
- Examples:
    - "off"
        - Do not read or write the value
    - "read"
        - Read the value only
    - "write"
        - Write the value only
    - "read,write"
        - Read and Write the value.
    - "failok"
        - If writing fails log errors only, don't fail the transfer

#### --onedrive-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,LeftSpace,LeftTilde,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --onedrive-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

### Metadata

OneDrive supports System Metadata (not User Metadata, as of this writing) for
both files and directories. Much of the metadata is read-only, and there are some
differences between OneDrive Personal and Business (see table below for
details).

Permissions are also supported, if `--onedrive-metadata-permissions` is set. The
accepted values for `--onedrive-metadata-permissions` are "`read`", "`write`",
"`read,write`", and "`off`" (the default). "`write`" supports adding new permissions,
updating the "role" of existing permissions, and removing permissions. Updating
and removing require the Permission ID to be known, so it is recommended to use
"`read,write`" instead of "`write`" if you wish to update/remove permissions.

Permissions are read/written in JSON format using the same schema as the
[OneDrive API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/resources/permission?view=odsp-graph-online),
which differs slightly between OneDrive Personal and Business.

Example for OneDrive Personal:
```json
[
	{
		"id": "1234567890ABC!123",
		"grantedTo": {
			"user": {
				"id": "ryan@contoso.com"
			},
			"application": {},
			"device": {}
		},
		"invitation": {
			"email": "ryan@contoso.com"
		},
		"link": {
			"webUrl": "https://1drv.ms/t/s!1234567890ABC"
		},
		"roles": [
			"read"
		],
		"shareId": "s!1234567890ABC"
	}
]
```

Example for OneDrive Business:
```json
[
	{
		"id": "48d31887-5fad-4d73-a9f5-3c356e68a038",
		"grantedToIdentities": [
			{
				"user": {
					"displayName": "ryan@contoso.com"
				},
				"application": {},
				"device": {}
			}
		],
		"link": {
			"type": "view",
			"scope": "users",
			"webUrl": "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/design/a577ghg9hgh737613bmbjf839026561fmzhsr85ng9f3hjck2t5s"
		},
		"roles": [
			"read"
		],
		"shareId": "u!LKj1lkdlals90j1nlkascl"
	},
	{
		"id": "5D33DD65C6932946",
		"grantedTo": {
			"user": {
				"displayName": "John Doe",
				"id": "efee1b77-fb3b-4f65-99d6-274c11914d12"
			},
			"application": {},
			"device": {}
		},
		"roles": [
			"owner"
		],
		"shareId": "FWxc1lasfdbEAGM5fI7B67aB5ZMPDMmQ11U"
	}
]
```

To write permissions, pass in a "permissions" metadata key using this same
format. The [`--metadata-mapper`](https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata-mapper) tool can
be very helpful for this.

When adding permissions, an email address can be provided in the `User.ID` or
`DisplayName` properties of `grantedTo` or `grantedToIdentities`. Alternatively,
an ObjectID can be provided in `User.ID`. At least one valid recipient must be
provided in order to add a permission for a user. Creating a Public Link is also
supported, if `Link.Scope` is set to `"anonymous"`.

Example request to add a "read" permission with `--metadata-mapper`:

```json
{
    "Metadata": {
        "permissions": "[{\"grantedToIdentities\":[{\"user\":{\"id\":\"ryan@contoso.com\"}}],\"roles\":[\"read\"]}]"
    }
}
```

Note that adding a permission can fail if a conflicting permission already
exists for the file/folder.

To update an existing permission, include both the Permission ID and the new
`roles` to be assigned. `roles` is the only property that can be changed.

To remove permissions, pass in a blob containing only the permissions you wish
to keep (which can be empty, to remove all.) Note that the `owner` role will be
ignored, as it cannot be removed.

Note that both reading and writing permissions requires extra API calls, so if
you don't need to read or write permissions it is recommended to omit
`--onedrive-metadata-permissions`.

Metadata and permissions are supported for Folders (directories) as well as
Files. Note that setting the `mtime` or `btime` on a Folder requires one extra
API call on OneDrive Business only.

OneDrive does not currently support User Metadata. When writing metadata, only
writeable system properties will be written -- any read-only or unrecognized keys
passed in will be ignored.

TIP: to see the metadata and permissions for any file or folder, run:

```
rclone lsjson remote:path --stat -M --onedrive-metadata-permissions read
```

Here are the possible system metadata items for the onedrive backend.

## Limitations

If you don't use rclone for 90 days the refresh token will
expire. This will result in authorization problems. This is easy to
fix by running the `rclone config reconnect remote:` command to get a
new token and refresh token.

### Naming

Note that OneDrive is case insensitive so you can't have a
file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are quite a few characters that can't be in OneDrive file
names.  These can't occur on Windows platforms, but on non-Windows
platforms they are common.  Rclone will map these names to and from an
identical looking unicode equivalent.  For example if a file has a `?`
in it will be mapped to `？` instead.

### File sizes

The largest allowed file size is 250 GiB for both OneDrive Personal and OneDrive for Business [(Updated 13 Jan 2021)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/invalid-file-names-and-file-types-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us#individualfilesize).

### Path length

The entire path, including the file name, must contain fewer than 400 characters for OneDrive, OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online. If you are encrypting file and folder names with rclone, you may want to pay attention to this limitation because the encrypted names are typically longer than the original ones.

### Number of files

OneDrive seems to be OK with at least 50,000 files in a folder, but at
100,000 rclone will get errors listing the directory like `couldn’t
list files: UnknownError:`.  See
[#2707](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2707) for more info.

An official document about the limitations for different types of OneDrive can be found [here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/invalid-file-names-and-file-types-in-onedrive-onedrive-for-business-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa).

## Versions

Every change in a file OneDrive causes the service to create a new
version of the file.  This counts against a users quota.  For
example changing the modification time of a file creates a second
version, so the file apparently uses twice the space.

For example the `copy` command is affected by this as rclone copies
the file and then afterwards sets the modification time to match the
source file which uses another version.

You can use the `rclone cleanup` command (see below) to remove all old
versions.

Or you can set the `no_versions` parameter to `true` and rclone will
remove versions after operations which create new versions. This takes
extra transactions so only enable it if you need it.

**Note** At the time of writing Onedrive Personal creates versions
(but not for setting the modification time) but the API for removing
them returns "API not found" so cleanup and `no_versions` should not
be used on Onedrive Personal.

### Disabling versioning

Starting October 2018, users will no longer be able to
disable versioning by default. This is because Microsoft has brought
an
[update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-OneDrive-Blog/New-Updates-to-OneDrive-and-SharePoint-Team-Site-Versioning/ba-p/204390)
to the mechanism. To change this new default setting, a PowerShell
command is required to be run by a SharePoint admin. If you are an
admin, you can run these commands in PowerShell to change that
setting:

1. `Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell` (in case you haven't installed this already)
2. `Import-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -DisableNameChecking`
3. `Connect-SPOService -Url https://YOURSITE-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential YOU@YOURSITE.COM` (replacing `YOURSITE`, `YOU`, `YOURSITE.COM` with the actual values; this will prompt for your credentials)
4. `Set-SPOTenant -EnableMinimumVersionRequirement $False`
5. `Disconnect-SPOService` (to disconnect from the server)

*Below are the steps for normal users to disable versioning. If you don't see the "No Versioning" option, make sure the above requirements are met.*

User [Weropol](https://github.com/Weropol) has found a method to disable
versioning on OneDrive

1. Open the settings menu by clicking on the gear symbol at the top of the OneDrive Business page.
2. Click Site settings.
3. Once on the Site settings page, navigate to Site Administration > Site libraries and lists.
4. Click Customize "Documents".
5. Click General Settings > Versioning Settings.
6. Under Document Version History select the option No versioning.
Note: This will disable the creation of new file versions, but will not remove any previous versions. Your documents are safe.
7. Apply the changes by clicking OK.
8. Use rclone to upload or modify files. (I also use the --no-update-modtime flag)
9. Restore the versioning settings after using rclone. (Optional)

## Cleanup

OneDrive supports `rclone cleanup` which causes rclone to look through
every file under the path supplied and delete all version but the
current version. Because this involves traversing all the files, then
querying each file for versions it can be quite slow. Rclone does
`--checkers` tests in parallel. The command also supports `--interactive`/`i`
or `--dry-run` which is a great way to see what it would do.

    rclone cleanup --interactive remote:path/subdir # interactively remove all old version for path/subdir
    rclone cleanup remote:path/subdir               # unconditionally remove all old version for path/subdir

**NB** Onedrive personal can't currently delete versions

## Troubleshooting ##

### Excessive throttling or blocked on SharePoint

If you experience excessive throttling or is being blocked on SharePoint then it may help to set the user agent explicitly with a flag like this: `--user-agent "ISV|rclone.org|rclone/v1.55.1"`

The specific details can be found in the Microsoft document: [Avoid getting throttled or blocked in SharePoint Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/general-development/how-to-avoid-getting-throttled-or-blocked-in-sharepoint-online#how-to-decorate-your-http-traffic-to-avoid-throttling)

### Unexpected file size/hash differences on Sharepoint ####

It is a
[known](https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs/issues/935#issuecomment-441741631)
issue that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for Business) silently modifies
uploaded files, mainly Office files (.docx, .xlsx, etc.), causing file size and
hash checks to fail. There are also other situations that will cause OneDrive to
report inconsistent file sizes. To use rclone with such
affected files on Sharepoint, you
may disable these checks with the following command line arguments:

```
--ignore-checksum --ignore-size
```

Alternatively, if you have write access to the OneDrive files, it may be possible
to fix this problem for certain files, by attempting the steps below.
Open the web interface for [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com) and find the
affected files (which will be in the error messages/log for rclone). Simply click on
each of these files, causing OneDrive to open them on the web. This will cause each
file to be converted in place to a format that is functionally equivalent
but which will no longer trigger the size discrepancy. Once all problematic files
are converted you will no longer need the ignore options above.

### Replacing/deleting existing files on Sharepoint gets "item not found" ####

It is a [known](https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs/issues/1068) issue
that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for Business) may return "item not
found" errors when users try to replace or delete uploaded files; this seems to
mainly affect Office files (.docx, .xlsx, etc.) and web files (.html, .aspx, etc.). As a workaround, you may use
the `--backup-dir <BACKUP_DIR>` command line argument so rclone moves the
files to be replaced/deleted into a given backup directory (instead of directly
replacing/deleting them). For example, to instruct rclone to move the files into
the directory `rclone-backup-dir` on backend `mysharepoint`, you may use:

```
--backup-dir mysharepoint:rclone-backup-dir
```

### access\_denied (AADSTS65005) ####

```
Error: access_denied
Code: AADSTS65005
Description: Using application 'rclone' is currently not supported for your organization [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] because it is in an unmanaged state. An administrator needs to claim ownership of the company by DNS validation of [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] before the application rclone can be provisioned.
```

This means that rclone can't use the OneDrive for Business API with your account. You can't do much about it, maybe write an email to your admins.

However, there are other ways to interact with your OneDrive account. Have a look at the WebDAV backend: https://rclone.org/webdav/#sharepoint

### invalid\_grant (AADSTS50076) ####

```
Error: invalid_grant
Code: AADSTS50076
Description: Due to a configuration change made by your administrator, or because you moved to a new location, you must use multi-factor authentication to access '...'.
```

If you see the error above after enabling multi-factor authentication for your account, you can fix it by refreshing your OAuth refresh token. To do that, run `rclone config`, and choose to edit your OneDrive backend. Then, you don't need to actually make any changes until you reach this question: `Already have a token - refresh?`. For this question, answer `y` and go through the process to refresh your token, just like the first time the backend is configured. After this, rclone should work again for this backend.

### Invalid request when making public links ####

On Sharepoint and OneDrive for Business, `rclone link` may return an "Invalid
request" error. A possible cause is that the organisation admin didn't allow
public links to be made for the organisation/sharepoint library. To fix the
permissions as an admin, take a look at the docs:
[1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off),
[2](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/set-up-and-manage-access-requests-94b26e0b-2822-49d4-929a-8455698654b3).

### Can not access `Shared` with me files

Shared with me files is not supported by rclone [currently](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4062), but there is a workaround:

1. Visit [https://onedrive.live.com](https://onedrive.live.com/)
2. Right click a item in `Shared`, then click `Add shortcut to My files` in the context
    ![make_shortcut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60313789/206118040-7e762b3b-aa61-41a1-8649-cc18889f3572.png "Screenshot (Shared with me)")
3. The shortcut will appear in `My files`, you can access it with rclone, it behaves like a normal folder/file.
    ![in_my_files](https://i.imgur.com/0S8H3li.png "Screenshot (My Files)")
    ![rclone_mount](https://i.imgur.com/2Iq66sW.png "Screenshot (rclone mount)")

### Live Photos uploaded from iOS (small video clips in .heic files)

The iOS OneDrive app introduced [upload and storage](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/live-photos-come-to-onedrive/ba-p/1953452) 
of [Live Photos](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207310) in 2020. 
The usage and download of these uploaded Live Photos is unfortunately still work-in-progress 
and this introduces several issues when copying, synchronising and mounting – both in rclone and in the native OneDrive client on Windows.

The root cause can easily be seen if you locate one of your Live Photos in the OneDrive web interface. 
Then download the photo from the web interface. You will then see that the size of downloaded .heic file is smaller than the size displayed in the web interface. 
The downloaded file is smaller because it only contains a single frame (still photo) extracted from the Live Photo (movie) stored in OneDrive.

The different sizes will cause `rclone copy/sync` to repeatedly recopy unmodified photos something like this:

    DEBUG : 20230203_123826234_iOS.heic: Sizes differ (src 4470314 vs dst 1298667)
    DEBUG : 20230203_123826234_iOS.heic: sha1 = fc2edde7863b7a7c93ca6771498ac797f8460750 OK
    INFO  : 20230203_123826234_iOS.heic: Copied (replaced existing)

These recopies can be worked around by adding `--ignore-size`. Please note that this workaround only syncs the still-picture not the movie clip, 
and relies on modification dates being correctly updated on all files in all situations.

The different sizes will also cause `rclone check` to report size errors something like this:

    ERROR : 20230203_123826234_iOS.heic: sizes differ

These check errors can be suppressed by adding `--ignore-size`.

The different sizes will also cause `rclone mount` to fail downloading with an error something like this:

    ERROR : 20230203_123826234_iOS.heic: ReadFileHandle.Read error: low level retry 1/10: unexpected EOF

or like this when using `--cache-mode=full`:

    INFO  : 20230203_123826234_iOS.heic: vfs cache: downloader: error count now 1: vfs reader: failed to write to cache file: 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable:
    ERROR : 20230203_123826234_iOS.heic: vfs cache: failed to download: vfs reader: failed to write to cache file: 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable:

To copy a local directory to an OpenDrive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modification times and hashes

OpenDrive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

The MD5 hash algorithm is supported.

### Restricted filename characters

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／          |
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊          |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：          |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜          |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞          |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？          |
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼          |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜          |

File names can also not begin or end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the first or last character in the name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |
| HT        | 0x09  | ␉           |
| LF        | 0x0A  | ␊           |
| VT        | 0x0B  | ␋           |
| CR        | 0x0D  | ␍           |


Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

## Limitations

Note that OpenDrive is case insensitive so you can't have a
file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are quite a few characters that can't be in OpenDrive file
names.  These can't occur on Windows platforms, but on non-Windows
platforms they are common.  Rclone will map these names to and from an
identical looking unicode equivalent.  For example if a file has a `?`
in it will be mapped to `？` instead.

`rclone about` is not supported by the OpenDrive backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) and [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

## Authentication Providers 

OCI has various authentication methods. To learn more about authentication methods please refer [oci authentication 
methods](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdk_authentication_methods.htm) 
These choices can be specified in the rclone config file.

Rclone supports the following OCI authentication provider.

    User Principal
    Instance Principal
    Resource Principal
    Workload Identity
    No authentication

### User Principal

Sample rclone config file for Authentication Provider User Principal:

    [oos]
    type = oracleobjectstorage
    namespace = id<redacted>34
    compartment = ocid1.compartment.oc1..aa<redacted>ba
    region = us-ashburn-1
    provider = user_principal_auth
    config_file = /home/opc/.oci/config
    config_profile = Default

Advantages:
- One can use this method from any server within OCI or on-premises or from other cloud provider.

Considerations:
- you need to configure user’s privileges / policy to allow access to object storage
- Overhead of managing users and keys.
- If the user is deleted, the config file will no longer work and may cause automation regressions that use the user's credentials.

###  Instance Principal

An OCI compute instance can be authorized to use rclone by using it's identity and certificates as an instance principal. 
With this approach no credentials have to be stored and managed.

Sample rclone configuration file for Authentication Provider Instance Principal:

    [opc@rclone ~]$ cat ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
    [oos]
    type = oracleobjectstorage
    namespace = id<redacted>fn
    compartment = ocid1.compartment.oc1..aa<redacted>k7a
    region = us-ashburn-1
    provider = instance_principal_auth

Advantages:

- With instance principals, you don't need to configure user credentials and transfer/ save it to disk in your compute 
  instances or rotate the credentials.
- You don’t need to deal with users and keys.
- Greatly helps in automation as you don't have to manage access keys, user private keys, storing them in vault, 
  using kms etc.

Considerations:

- You need to configure a dynamic group having this instance as member and add policy to read object storage to that 
  dynamic group.
- Everyone who has access to this machine can execute the CLI commands.
- It is applicable for oci compute instances only. It cannot be used on external instance or resources.

### Resource Principal

Resource principal auth is very similar to instance principal auth but used for resources that are not 
compute instances such as [serverless functions](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Concepts/functionsoverview.htm). 
To use resource principal ensure Rclone process is started with these environment variables set in its process.

    export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_VERSION=2.2
    export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_REGION=us-ashburn-1
    export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_PRIVATE_PEM=/usr/share/model-server/key.pem
    export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_RPST=/usr/share/model-server/security_token

Sample rclone configuration file for Authentication Provider Resource Principal:

    [oos]
    type = oracleobjectstorage
    namespace = id<redacted>34
    compartment = ocid1.compartment.oc1..aa<redacted>ba
    region = us-ashburn-1
    provider = resource_principal_auth

### Workload Identity
Workload Identity auth may be used when running Rclone from Kubernetes pod on a Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) cluster.
For more details on configuring Workload Identity, see [Granting Workloads Access to OCI Resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contenggrantingworkloadaccesstoresources.htm).
To use workload identity, ensure Rclone is started with these environment variables set in its process.

    export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_VERSION=2.2
    export OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_REGION=us-ashburn-1

### No authentication

Public buckets do not require any authentication mechanism to read objects.
Sample rclone configuration file for No authentication:
    
    [oos]
    type = oracleobjectstorage
    namespace = id<redacted>34
    compartment = ocid1.compartment.oc1..aa<redacted>ba
    region = us-ashburn-1
    provider = no_auth

### Modification times and hashes

The modification time is stored as metadata on the object as
`opc-meta-mtime` as floating point since the epoch, accurate to 1 ns.

If the modification time needs to be updated rclone will attempt to perform a server
side copy to update the modification if the object can be copied in a single part.
In the case the object is larger than 5Gb, the object will be uploaded rather than copied.

Note that reading this from the object takes an additional `HEAD` request as the metadata
isn't returned in object listings.

The MD5 hash algorithm is supported.

### Multipart uploads

rclone supports multipart uploads with OOS which means that it can
upload files bigger than 5 GiB.

Note that files uploaded *both* with multipart upload *and* through
crypt remotes do not have MD5 sums.

rclone switches from single part uploads to multipart uploads at the
point specified by `--oos-upload-cutoff`.  This can be a maximum of 5 GiB
and a minimum of 0 (ie always upload multipart files).

The chunk sizes used in the multipart upload are specified by
`--oos-chunk-size` and the number of chunks uploaded concurrently is
specified by `--oos-upload-concurrency`.

Multipart uploads will use `--transfers` * `--oos-upload-concurrency` *
`--oos-chunk-size` extra memory.  Single part uploads to not use extra
memory.

Single part transfers can be faster than multipart transfers or slower
depending on your latency from oos - the more latency, the more likely
single part transfers will be faster.

Increasing `--oos-upload-concurrency` will increase throughput (8 would
be a sensible value) and increasing `--oos-chunk-size` also increases
throughput (16M would be sensible).  Increasing either of these will
use more memory.  The default values are high enough to gain most of
the possible performance without using too much memory.

#### --oos-chunk-size

Chunk size to use for uploading.

When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff or files with unknown
size (e.g. from "rclone rcat" or uploaded with "rclone mount" they will be uploaded 
as multipart uploads using this chunk size.

Note that "upload_concurrency" chunks of this size are buffered
in memory per transfer.

If you are transferring large files over high-speed links and you have
enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.

Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a
large file of known size to stay below the 10,000 chunks limit.

Files of unknown size are uploaded with the configured
chunk_size. Since the default chunk size is 5 MiB and there can be at
most 10,000 chunks, this means that by default the maximum size of
a file you can stream upload is 48 GiB.  If you wish to stream upload
larger files then you will need to increase chunk_size.

Increasing the chunk size decreases the accuracy of the progress
statistics displayed with "-P" flag.


Properties:

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     5Mi

#### --oos-max-upload-parts

Maximum number of parts in a multipart upload.

This option defines the maximum number of multipart chunks to use
when doing a multipart upload.

OCI has max parts limit of 10,000 chunks.

Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a
large file of a known size to stay below this number of chunks limit.


Properties:

- Config:      max_upload_parts
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_MAX_UPLOAD_PARTS
- Type:        int
- Default:     10000

#### --oos-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently.

If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links
and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing
this may help to speed up the transfers.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     10

#### --oos-copy-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to multipart copy.

Any files larger than this that need to be server-side copied will be
copied in chunks of this size.

The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.

Properties:

- Config:      copy_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_COPY_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     4.656Gi

#### --oos-copy-timeout

Timeout for copy.

Copy is an asynchronous operation, specify timeout to wait for copy to succeed


Properties:

- Config:      copy_timeout
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_COPY_TIMEOUT
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --oos-disable-checksum

Don't store MD5 checksum with object metadata.

Normally rclone will calculate the MD5 checksum of the input before
uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great
for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files
to start uploading.

Properties:

- Config:      disable_checksum
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_DISABLE_CHECKSUM
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --oos-encoding

- Default:     Slash,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --oos-leave-parts-on-error

If true avoid calling abort upload on a failure, leaving all successfully uploaded parts for manual recovery.

It should be set to true for resuming uploads across different sessions.

WARNING: Storing parts of an incomplete multipart upload counts towards space usage on object storage and will add
additional costs if not cleaned up.


Properties:

- Config:      leave_parts_on_error
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_LEAVE_PARTS_ON_ERROR
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --oos-attempt-resume-upload

If true attempt to resume previously started multipart upload for the object.
This will be helpful to speed up multipart transfers by resuming uploads from past session.

WARNING: If chunk size differs in resumed session from past incomplete session, then the resumed multipart upload is 
aborted and a new multipart upload is started with the new chunk size.

The flag leave_parts_on_error must be true to resume and optimize to skip parts that were already uploaded successfully.


Properties:

- Config:      attempt_resume_upload
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OOS_ATTEMPT_RESUME_UPLOAD
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --oos-no-check-bucket

If set, don't attempt to check the bucket exists or create it.

This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions
rclone does if you know the bucket exists already.

It can also be needed if the user you are using does not have bucket
creation permissions.


Properties:

- Config:      no_check_bucket

## Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the oracleobjectstorage backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the [backend](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command).

### rename

change the name of an object

    rclone backend rename remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command can be used to rename a object.

Usage Examples:

    rclone backend rename oos:bucket relative-object-path-under-bucket object-new-name


### list-multipart-uploads

List the unfinished multipart uploads

    rclone backend list-multipart-uploads remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command lists the unfinished multipart uploads in JSON format.

    rclone backend list-multipart-uploads oos:bucket/path/to/object

It returns a dictionary of buckets with values as lists of unfinished
multipart uploads.

You can call it with no bucket in which case it lists all bucket, with
a bucket or with a bucket and path.

    {
      "test-bucket": [
                {
                        "namespace": "test-namespace",
                        "bucket": "test-bucket",
                        "object": "600m.bin",
                        "uploadId": "51dd8114-52a4-b2f2-c42f-5291f05eb3c8",
                        "timeCreated": "2022-07-29T06:21:16.595Z",
                        "storageTier": "Standard"
                }
        ]


### cleanup

Remove unfinished multipart uploads.

    rclone backend cleanup remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command removes unfinished multipart uploads of age greater than
max-age which defaults to 24 hours.

Note that you can use --interactive/-i or --dry-run with this command to see what
it would do.

    rclone backend cleanup oos:bucket/path/to/object
    rclone backend cleanup -o max-age=7w oos:bucket/path/to/object

Durations are parsed as per the rest of rclone, 2h, 7d, 7w etc.


Options:

- "max-age": Max age of upload to delete

### restore

Restore objects from Archive to Standard storage

    rclone backend restore remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command can be used to restore one or more objects from Archive to Standard storage.

	Usage Examples:

    rclone backend restore oos:bucket/path/to/directory -o hours=HOURS
    rclone backend restore oos:bucket -o hours=HOURS

This flag also obeys the filters. Test first with --interactive/-i or --dry-run flags

	rclone --interactive backend restore --include "*.txt" oos:bucket/path -o hours=72

All the objects shown will be marked for restore, then

	rclone backend restore --include "*.txt" oos:bucket/path -o hours=72

	It returns a list of status dictionaries with Object Name and Status
	keys. The Status will be "RESTORED"" if it was successful or an error message
	if not.

	[
		{
			"Object": "test.txt"
			"Status": "RESTORED",
		},
		{
			"Object": "test/file4.txt"
			"Status": "RESTORED",
		}
	]


Options:

- "hours": The number of hours for which this object will be restored. Default is 24 hrs.



## Tutorials
### [Mounting Buckets](https://rclone.org/oracleobjectstorage/tutorial_mount/)

#  QingStor

Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of making an QingStor configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/r/c/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / QingStor Object Storage
   \ "qingstor"
[snip]
Storage> qingstor
Get QingStor credentials from runtime. Only applies if access_key_id and secret_access_key is blank.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Enter QingStor credentials in the next step
   \ "false"
 2 / Get QingStor credentials from the environment (env vars or IAM)
   \ "true"
env_auth> 1
QingStor Access Key ID - leave blank for anonymous access or runtime credentials.
access_key_id> access_key
QingStor Secret Access Key (password) - leave blank for anonymous access or runtime credentials.
secret_access_key> secret_key
Enter an endpoint URL to connection QingStor API.
Leave blank will use the default value "https://qingstor.com:443"
endpoint>
Zone connect to. Default is "pek3a".
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
   / The Beijing (China) Three Zone
 1 | Needs location constraint pek3a.
   \ "pek3a"
   / The Shanghai (China) First Zone
 2 | Needs location constraint sh1a.
   \ "sh1a"
zone> 1
Number of connection retry.
Leave blank will use the default value "3".
connection_retries>
Remote config
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: qingstor
- env_auth: false
- access_key_id: access_key
- secret_access_key: secret_key
- endpoint:
- zone: pek3a
- connection_retries:
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:bucket

### --fast-list

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

### Multipart uploads

rclone supports multipart uploads with QingStor which means that it can
upload files bigger than 5 GiB. Note that files uploaded with multipart
upload don't have an MD5SUM.

Note that incomplete multipart uploads older than 24 hours can be
removed with `rclone cleanup remote:bucket` just for one bucket
`rclone cleanup remote:` for all buckets. QingStor does not ever
remove incomplete multipart uploads so it may be necessary to run this
from time to time.

### Buckets and Zone

With QingStor you can list buckets (`rclone lsd`) using any zone,
but you can only access the content of a bucket from the zone it was
created in.  If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong zone,
you will get an error, `incorrect zone, the bucket is not in 'XXX'
zone`.

### Authentication

There are two ways to supply `rclone` with a set of QingStor
credentials. In order of precedence:

 - Directly in the rclone configuration file (as configured by `rclone config`)
   - set `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`
 - Runtime configuration:
   - set `env_auth` to `true` in the config file
   - Exporting the following environment variables before running `rclone`
     - Access Key ID: `QS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `QS_ACCESS_KEY`
     - Secret Access Key: `QS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `QS_SECRET_KEY`

### Restricted filename characters

The control characters 0x00-0x1F and / are replaced as in the [default
restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters).  Note
that 0x7F is not replaced.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the qingstor backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) and [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Quatrix

Quatrix by Maytech is [Quatrix Secure Compliant File Sharing | Maytech](https://www.maytech.net/products/quatrix-business).

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g., `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

The initial setup for Quatrix involves getting an API Key from Quatrix. You can get the API key in the user's profile at `https://<account>/profile/api-keys`
or with the help of the API - https://docs.maytech.net/quatrix/quatrix-api/api-explorer#/API-Key/post_api_key_create.

See complete Swagger documentation for Quatrix - https://docs.maytech.net/quatrix/quatrix-api/api-explorer

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Quatrix by Maytech
   \ "quatrix"
[snip]
Storage> quatrix
API key for accessing Quatrix account.
api_key> your_api_key
Host name of Quatrix account.
host> example.quatrix.it

Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: quatrix
- api_key: your_api_key
- host: example.quatrix.it
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Quatrix

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Quatrix

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Quatrix directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### API key validity

API Key is created with no expiration date. It will be valid until you delete or deactivate it in your account.
After disabling, the API Key can be enabled back. If the API Key was deleted and a new key was created, you can
update it in rclone config. The same happens if the hostname was changed.

```
$ rclone config
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
remote               quatrix

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> e
Choose a number from below, or type in an existing value
 1 > remote
remote> remote
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: quatrix
- host: some_host.quatrix.it
- api_key: your_api_key
Keep this "remote" remote?
Edit remote
Option api_key.
API key for accessing Quatrix account
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (your_api_key)
api_key>
Option host.
Host name of Quatrix account
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (some_host.quatrix.it).

Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: quatrix
- host: some_host.quatrix.it
- api_key: your_api_key
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

### Modification times and hashes

Quatrix allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1 microsecond.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.

Quatrix does not support hashes, so you cannot use the `--checksum` flag.

### Restricted filename characters

File names in Quatrix are case sensitive and have limitations like the maximum length of a filename is 255, and the minimum length is 1. A file name cannot be equal to `.` or `..` nor contain `/` , `\` or non-printable ascii.

### Transfers

For files above 50 MiB rclone will use a chunked transfer. Rclone will upload up to `--transfers` chunks at the same time (shared among all multipart uploads).
Chunks are buffered in memory, and the minimal chunk size is 10_000_000 bytes by default, and it can be changed in the advanced configuration, so increasing `--transfers` will increase the memory use.
The chunk size has a maximum size limit, which is set to 100_000_000 bytes by default and can be changed in the advanced configuration.
The size of the uploaded chunk will dynamically change depending on the upload speed.
The total memory use equals the number of transfers multiplied by the minimal chunk size.
In case there's free memory allocated for the upload (which equals the difference of `maximal_summary_chunk_size` and `minimal_chunk_size` * `transfers`),
the chunk size may increase in case of high upload speed. As well as it can decrease in case of upload speed problems.
If no free memory is available, all chunks will equal `minimal_chunk_size`.

### Deleting files

Files you delete with rclone will end up in Trash and be stored there for 30 days.
Quatrix also provides an API to permanently delete files and an API to empty the Trash so that you can remove files permanently from your account.


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to quatrix (Quatrix by Maytech).

## Storage usage

The storage usage in Quatrix is restricted to the account during the purchase. You can restrict any user with a smaller storage limit.
The account limit is applied if the user has no custom storage limit. Once you've reached the limit, the upload of files will fail.
This can be fixed by freeing up the space or increasing the quota.

## Server-side operations

Quatrix supports server-side operations (copy and move). In case of conflict, files are overwritten during server-side operation.

#  Sia

Sia ([sia.tech](https://sia.tech/)) is a decentralized cloud storage platform
based on the [blockchain](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) technology.
With rclone you can use it like any other remote filesystem or mount Sia folders
locally. The technology behind it involves a number of new concepts such as
Siacoins and Wallet, Blockchain and Consensus, Renting and Hosting, and so on.
If you are new to it, you'd better first familiarize yourself using their
excellent [support documentation](https://support.sia.tech/).

## Introduction

Before you can use rclone with Sia, you will need to have a running copy of
`Sia-UI` or `siad` (the Sia daemon) locally on your computer or on local
network (e.g. a NAS). Please follow the [Get started](https://sia.tech/get-started)
guide and install one.

rclone interacts with Sia network by talking to the Sia daemon via [HTTP API](https://sia.tech/docs/)
which is usually available on port _9980_. By default you will run the daemon
locally on the same computer so it's safe to leave the API password blank
(the API URL will be `http://127.0.0.1:9980` making external access impossible).

However, if you want to access Sia daemon running on another node, for example
due to memory constraints or because you want to share single daemon between
several rclone and Sia-UI instances, you'll need to make a few more provisions:
- Ensure you have _Sia daemon_ installed directly or in
  a [docker container](https://github.com/SiaFoundation/siad/pkgs/container/siad)
  because Sia-UI does not support this mode natively.
- Run it on externally accessible port, for example provide `--api-addr :9980`
  and `--disable-api-security` arguments on the daemon command line.
- Enforce API password for the `siad` daemon via environment variable
  `SIA_API_PASSWORD` or text file named `apipassword` in the daemon directory.
- Set rclone backend option `api_password` taking it from above locations.


Notes:
1. If your wallet is locked, rclone cannot unlock it automatically.
   You should either unlock it in advance by using Sia-UI or via command line
   `siac wallet unlock`.
   Alternatively you can make `siad` unlock your wallet automatically upon
   startup by running it with environment variable `SIA_WALLET_PASSWORD`.
2. If `siad` cannot find the `SIA_API_PASSWORD` variable or the `apipassword` file
   in the `SIA_DIR` directory, it will generate a random password and store in the
   text file named `apipassword` under `YOUR_HOME/.sia/` directory on Unix
   or `C:\Users\YOUR_HOME\AppData\Local\Sia\apipassword` on Windows.
   Remember this when you configure password in rclone.
3. The only way to use `siad` without API password is to run it **on localhost**
   with command line argument `--authorize-api=false`, but this is insecure and
   **strongly discouraged**.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a `sia` remote called `mySia`.
First, run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> mySia
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
...
29 / Sia Decentralized Cloud
   \ "sia"
...
Storage> sia
Sia daemon API URL, like http://sia.daemon.host:9980.
Note that siad must run with --disable-api-security to open API port for other hosts (not recommended).
Keep default if Sia daemon runs on localhost.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("http://127.0.0.1:9980").
api_url> http://127.0.0.1:9980
Sia Daemon API Password.
Can be found in the apipassword file located in HOME/.sia/ or in the daemon directory.
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No leave this optional password blank (default)
y/g/n> y
Enter the password:
password:
Confirm the password:
password:
Edit advanced config?
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
--------------------
[mySia]
type = sia
api_url = http://127.0.0.1:9980
api_password = *** ENCRYPTED ***
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Once configured, you can then use `rclone` like this:

- List directories in top level of your Sia storage

```
rclone lsd mySia:
```

- List all the files in your Sia storage

```
rclone ls mySia:
```

- Upload a local directory to the Sia directory called _backup_

```
rclone copy /home/source mySia:backup
```


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to sia (Sia Decentralized Cloud).

#### --sia-api-url

Sia daemon API URL, like http://sia.daemon.host:9980.

Note that siad must run with --disable-api-security to open API port for other hosts (not recommended).

- Env Var:     RCLONE_SIA_API_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     "http://127.0.0.1:9980"

#### --sia-api-password

Sia Daemon API Password.

Can be found in the apipassword file located in HOME/.sia/ or in the daemon directory.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

Properties:

- Config:      api_password
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SIA_API_PASSWORD
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to sia (Sia Decentralized Cloud).

#### --sia-user-agent

## Limitations

- Modification times not supported
- Checksums not supported
- `rclone about` not supported
- rclone can work only with _Siad_ or _Sia-UI_ at the moment,
  the **SkyNet daemon is not supported yet.**
- Sia does not allow control characters or symbols like question and pound
  signs in file names. rclone will transparently [encode](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding)
  them for you, but you'd better be aware

#  Swift

Swift refers to [OpenStack Object Storage](https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/).
Commercial implementations of that being:

  * [Rackspace Cloud Files](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/)
  * [Memset Memstore](https://www.memset.com/cloud/storage/)
  * [OVH Object Storage](https://www.ovh.co.uk/public-cloud/storage/object-storage/)
  * [Oracle Cloud Storage](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/integration/doc/configure-object-storage.html)
  * [Blomp Cloud Storage](https://www.blomp.com/cloud-storage/)
  * [IBM Bluemix Cloud ObjectStorage Swift](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/infrastructure/objectstorage-swift/index.html)

Paths are specified as `remote:container` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:container/path/to/dir`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of making a swift configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

Remote config
--------------------
[test]
env_auth = true
user = 
key = 
auth = 
user_id = 
domain = 
tenant = 
tenant_id = 
tenant_domain = 
region = 
storage_url = 
auth_token = 
auth_version = 
endpoint_type = 
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all containers

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new container

    rclone mkdir remote:container

List the contents of a container

    rclone ls remote:container

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote container, deleting any
excess files in the container.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:container

### Configuration from an OpenStack credentials file

An OpenStack credentials file typically looks something something
like this (without the comments)

```
export OS_AUTH_URL=https://a.provider.net/v2.0
export OS_TENANT_ID=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
export OS_TENANT_NAME="1234567890123456"
export OS_USERNAME="123abc567xy"
echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password: "
read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
export OS_REGION_NAME="SBG1"
if [ -z "$OS_REGION_NAME" ]; then unset OS_REGION_NAME; fi
```

The config file needs to look something like this where `$OS_USERNAME`
represents the value of the `OS_USERNAME` variable - `123abc567xy` in
the example above.

```
[remote]
type = swift
user = $OS_USERNAME
key = $OS_PASSWORD
auth = $OS_AUTH_URL
tenant = $OS_TENANT_NAME
```

Note that you may (or may not) need to set `region` too - try without first.

### Configuration from the environment

If you prefer you can configure rclone to use swift using a standard
set of OpenStack environment variables.

When you run through the config, make sure you choose `true` for
`env_auth` and leave everything else blank.

rclone will then set any empty config parameters from the environment
using standard OpenStack environment variables.  There is [a list of
the
variables](https://godoc.org/github.com/ncw/swift#Connection.ApplyEnvironment)
in the docs for the swift library.

### Using an alternate authentication method

If your OpenStack installation uses a non-standard authentication method
that might not be yet supported by rclone or the underlying swift library, 
you can authenticate externally (e.g. calling manually the `openstack` 
commands to get a token). Then, you just need to pass the two 
configuration variables ``auth_token`` and ``storage_url``. 
If they are both provided, the other variables are ignored. rclone will 
not try to authenticate but instead assume it is already authenticated 
and use these two variables to access the OpenStack installation.

#### Using rclone without a config file

You can use rclone with swift without a config file, if desired, like
this:

```
source openstack-credentials-file
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_TYPE=swift
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_ENV_AUTH=true
rclone lsd myremote:
```

### --fast-list

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

### --update and --use-server-modtime

As noted below, the modified time is stored on metadata on the object. It is
used by default for all operations that require checking the time a file was
last updated. It allows rclone to treat the remote more like a true filesystem,
but it is inefficient because it requires an extra API call to retrieve the
metadata.

For many operations, the time the object was last uploaded to the remote is
sufficient to determine if it is "dirty". By using `--update` along with
`--use-server-modtime`, you can avoid the extra API call and simply upload
files whose local modtime is newer than the time it was last uploaded.

### Modification times and hashes

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
`X-Object-Meta-Mtime` as floating point since the epoch accurate to 1
ns.

This is a de facto standard (used in the official python-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.

The MD5 hash algorithm is supported.

### Restricted filename characters

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

Consider using this option if rclone listings show fewer objects
than expected, or if repeated syncs copy unchanged objects.

It is safe to enable this, but rclone may make more API calls than
necessary.

This is one of a pair of workarounds to handle implementations
of the Swift API that do not implement pagination as expected.  See
also "fetch_until_empty_page".

Properties:

- Config:      partial_page_fetch_threshold

Above this size files will be chunked.

Above this size files will be chunked into a a `_segments` container
or a `.file-segments` directory. (See the `use_segments_container` option
for more info). Default for this is 5 GiB which is its maximum value, which
means only files above this size will be chunked.

Rclone uploads chunked files as dynamic large objects (DLO).


Properties:

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SWIFT_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     5Gi

#### --swift-no-chunk

Don't chunk files during streaming upload.

When doing streaming uploads (e.g. using `rcat` or `mount` with
`--vfs-cache-mode off`) setting this flag will cause the swift backend
to not upload chunked files.

This will limit the maximum streamed upload size to 5 GiB. This is
useful because non chunked files are easier to deal with and have an
MD5SUM.

Rclone will still chunk files bigger than `chunk_size` when doing
normal copy operations.

Properties:

- Config:      no_chunk
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SWIFT_NO_CHUNK
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --swift-no-large-objects

Disable support for static and dynamic large objects

Swift cannot transparently store files bigger than 5 GiB. There are
two schemes for chunking large files, static large objects (SLO) or
dynamic large objects (DLO), and the API does not allow rclone to
determine whether a file is a static or dynamic large object without
doing a HEAD on the object. Since these need to be treated
differently, this means rclone has to issue HEAD requests for objects
for example when reading checksums.

When `no_large_objects` is set, rclone will assume that there are no
static or dynamic large objects stored. This means it can stop doing
the extra HEAD calls which in turn increases performance greatly
especially when doing a swift to swift transfer with `--checksum` set.

Setting this option implies `no_chunk` and also that no files will be
uploaded in chunks, so files bigger than 5 GiB will just fail on
upload.

If you set this option and there **are** static or dynamic large objects,
then this will give incorrect hashes for them. Downloads will succeed,
but other operations such as Remove and Copy will fail.


Properties:

- Config:      no_large_objects
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SWIFT_NO_LARGE_OBJECTS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --swift-use-segments-container

Choose destination for large object segments

Swift cannot transparently store files bigger than 5 GiB and rclone
will chunk files larger than `chunk_size` (default 5 GiB) in order to
upload them.

If this value is `true` the chunks will be stored in an additional
container named the same as the destination container but with
`_segments` appended. This means that there won't be any duplicated
data in the original container but having another container may not be
acceptable.

If this value is `false` the chunks will be stored in a
`.file-segments` directory in the root of the container. This
directory will be omitted when listing the container. Some
providers (eg Blomp) require this mode as creating additional
containers isn't allowed. If it is desired to see the `.file-segments`
directory in the root then this flag must be set to `true`.

If this value is `unset` (the default), then rclone will choose the value
to use. It will be `false` unless rclone detects any `auth_url`s that
it knows need it to be `true`. In this case you'll see a message in
the DEBUG log.


Properties:

- Config:      use_segments_container
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SWIFT_USE_SEGMENTS_CONTAINER
- Type:        Tristate
- Default:     unset

#### --swift-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SWIFT_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,InvalidUtf8

#### --swift-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SWIFT_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false



## Limitations

The Swift API doesn't return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won't check or use the
MD5SUM for these.

## Troubleshooting

### Rclone gives Failed to create file system for "remote:": Bad Request

Due to an oddity of the underlying swift library, it gives a "Bad
Request" error rather than a more sensible error when the
authentication fails for Swift.

So this most likely means your username / password is wrong.  You can
investigate further with the `--dump-bodies` flag.

This may also be caused by specifying the region when you shouldn't
have (e.g. OVH).

### Rclone gives Failed to create file system: Response didn't have storage url and auth token

This is most likely caused by forgetting to specify your tenant when
setting up a swift remote.

## OVH Cloud Archive

To use rclone with OVH cloud archive, first use `rclone config` to set up a `swift` backend with OVH, choosing `pca` as the `storage_policy`.

### Uploading Objects

Uploading objects to OVH cloud archive is no different to object storage, you just simply run the command you like (move, copy or sync) to upload the objects. Once uploaded the objects will show in a "Frozen" state within the OVH control panel.

### Retrieving Objects

To retrieve objects use `rclone copy` as normal. If the objects are in a frozen state then rclone will ask for them all to be unfrozen and it will wait at the end of the output with a message like the following:

`2019/03/23 13:06:33 NOTICE: Received retry after error - sleeping until 2019-03-23T13:16:33.481657164+01:00 (9m59.99985121s)`

Rclone will wait for the time specified then retry the copy.

#  pCloud

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for pCloud involves getting a token from pCloud which you
need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Pcloud
   \ "pcloud"
[snip]
Storage> pcloud
Pcloud App Client Id - leave blank normally.
client_id> 
Pcloud App Client Secret - leave blank normally.
client_secret> 
Remote config
Use web browser to automatically authenticate rclone with remote?
 * Say Y if the machine running rclone has a web browser you can use
 * Say N if running rclone on a (remote) machine without web browser access
If not sure try Y. If Y failed, try N.
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: pcloud
- client_id:
- client_secret:
- token: {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"bearer","expiry":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from pCloud. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.  This
is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require you to unblock
it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your pCloud

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your pCloud

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a pCloud directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modification times and hashes

pCloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.  These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.  In order to set a Modification time pCloud requires the object
be re-uploaded.

pCloud supports MD5 and SHA1 hashes in the US region, and SHA1 and SHA256
hashes in the EU region, so you can use the `--checksum` flag.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Deleting files

Deleted files will be moved to the trash.  Your subscription level
will determine how long items stay in the trash.  `rclone cleanup` can
be used to empty the trash.

### Emptying the trash

Due to an API limitation, the `rclone cleanup` command will only work if you 
set your username and password in the advanced options for this backend. 
Since we generally want to avoid storing user passwords in the rclone config
file, we advise you to only set this up if you need the `rclone cleanup` command to work.

### Root folder ID

You can set the `root_folder_id` for rclone.  This is the directory
(identified by its `Folder ID`) that rclone considers to be the root
of your pCloud drive.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the
correct root to use itself.

However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.

In order to do this you will have to find the `Folder ID` of the
directory you wish rclone to display.  This will be the `folder` field
of the URL when you open the relevant folder in the pCloud web
interface.

So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
`https://my.pcloud.com/#page=filemanager&folder=5xxxxxxxx8&tpl=foldergrid`
in the browser, then you use `5xxxxxxxx8` as
the `root_folder_id` in the config.

#### --pikpak-chunk-size

Chunk size for multipart uploads.
	
Large files will be uploaded in chunks of this size.

Note that this is stored in memory and there may be up to
"--transfers" * "--pikpak-upload-concurrency" chunks stored at once
in memory.

If you are transferring large files over high-speed links and you have
enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.

Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a
large file of known size to stay below the 10,000 chunks limit.

Increasing the chunk size decreases the accuracy of the progress
statistics displayed with "-P" flag.

Properties:

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_PIKPAK_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     5Mi

#### --pikpak-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently for multipart uploads.

Note that chunks are stored in memory and there may be up to
"--transfers" * "--pikpak-upload-concurrency" chunks stored at once
in memory.

If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links
and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing
this may help to speed up the transfers.

Properties:

- Config:      upload_concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_PIKPAK_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     5

#### --pikpak-encoding

#### --pikpak-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_PIKPAK_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

## Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the pikpak backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the [backend](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command).

### addurl

Add offline download task for url

    rclone backend addurl remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command adds offline download task for url.

Usage:

    rclone backend addurl pikpak:dirpath url

Downloads will be stored in 'dirpath'. If 'dirpath' is invalid, 
download will fallback to default 'My Pack' folder.


### decompress

Request decompress of a file/files in a folder

    rclone backend decompress remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command requests decompress of file/files in a folder.

Usage:

    rclone backend decompress pikpak:dirpath {filename} -o password=password
    rclone backend decompress pikpak:dirpath {filename} -o delete-src-file

An optional argument 'filename' can be specified for a file located in 
'pikpak:dirpath'. You may want to pass '-o password=password' for a 
password-protected files. Also, pass '-o delete-src-file' to delete 
source files after decompression finished.

Result:

    {
        "Decompressed": 17,
        "SourceDeleted": 0,
        "Errors": 0
    }




## Limitations

### Hashes may be empty

PikPak supports MD5 hash, but sometimes given empty especially for user-uploaded files.

### Deleted files still visible with trashed-only

Deleted files will still be visible with `--pikpak-trashed-only` even after the
trash emptied. This goes away after few days.

#  Pixeldrain

This is the backend for Pixeldrain's premium filesystem feature. This is not the
same as pixeldrain's free file sharing product. The filesystem requires either a
Pro subscription or the Prepaid plan. [More information on
subscriptions](https://pixeldrain.com/#pro).

An overview of the filesystem's features and limitations is available in the
[filesystem guide](https://pixeldrain.com/filesystem) on pixeldrain.

### Usage with account

To use the personal filesystem you will need a [pixeldrain
account](https://pixeldrain.com/register) and either the Prepaid plan or one of
the Patreon-based subscriptions. After registering and subscribing, your
personal filesystem will be available at this link: https://pixeldrain.com/d/me.

Go to the [API keys page](https://pixeldrain.com/user/api_keys) on your account
and generate a new API key for rclone. Then run `rclone config` and use the API
key to create a new backend.

Example:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/d/c/s/q> n

Enter name for new remote.
name> pixeldrainfs

Option Storage.
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.
...
XX / Pixeldrain Filesystem
   \ (pixeldrain)

Keep this "pixeldrainfs" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d>

Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q
```

### Usage without account

It is possible to gain read-only access to publicly shared directories through
rclone. For this you only need a directory ID. The directory ID can be found in
the URL of a shared directory, the URL will look like this
`https://pixeldrain.com/d/abcd1234` where `abcd1234` is the directory ID.
Directory IDs in your own filesystem can also be listed with the `lsf` command:

`rclone lsf Pixeldrain: --dirs-only -Fpi`

This will print directories in your `Pixeldrain` home directory and their public
IDs.

Enter this directory ID in the rclone config and you will be able to access the
directory.

#  premiumize.me

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for [premiumize.me](https://premiumize.me/) involves getting a token from premiumize.me which you
need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / premiumize.me
   \ "premiumizeme"
[snip]
Storage> premiumizeme
** See help for premiumizeme backend at: https://rclone.org/premiumizeme/ **

Remote config
Use web browser to automatically authenticate rclone with remote?
 * Say Y if the machine running rclone has a web browser you can use
 * Say N if running rclone on a (remote) machine without web browser access
If not sure try Y. If Y failed, try N.
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: premiumizeme
- token: {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"2029-08-07T18:44:15.548915378+01:00"}
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> 
```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from premiumize.me. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.  This
is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require you to unblock
it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your premiumize.me

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your premiumize.me

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an premiumize.me directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modification times and hashes

premiumize.me does not support modification times or hashes, therefore
syncing will default to `--size-only` checking.  Note that using
`--update` will work.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |
| "         | 0x22  | ＂           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to premiumizeme (premiumize.me).

#### --premiumizeme-client-id

## Limitations

Note that premiumize.me is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

premiumize.me file names can't have the `\` or `"` characters in.
rclone maps these to and from an identical looking unicode equivalents
`＼` and `＂`

premiumize.me only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.

#  Proton Drive

[Proton Drive](https://proton.me/drive) is an end-to-end encrypted Swiss vault
 for your files that protects your data.

This is an rclone backend for Proton Drive which supports the file transfer
features of Proton Drive using the same client-side encryption.

Due to the fact that Proton Drive doesn't publish its API documentation, this 
backend is implemented with best efforts by reading the open-sourced client 
source code and observing the Proton Drive traffic in the browser.

**NB** This backend is currently in Beta. It is believed to be correct
and all the integration tests pass. However the Proton Drive protocol
has evolved over time there may be accounts it is not compatible
with. Please [post on the rclone forum](https://forum.rclone.org/) if
you find an incompatibility.

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configurations

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?

y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

**NOTE:** The Proton Drive encryption keys need to have been already generated 
after a regular login via the browser, otherwise attempting to use the 
credentials in `rclone` will fail.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Proton Drive

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Proton Drive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Proton Drive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modification times and hashes

Proton Drive Bridge does not support updating modification times yet.

The SHA1 hash algorithm is supported.

### Restricted filename characters

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), also left and 
right spaces will be removed ([code reference](https://github.com/ProtonMail/WebClients/blob/b4eba99d241af4fdae06ff7138bd651a40ef5d3c/applications/drive/src/app/store/_links/validation.ts#L51))

### Duplicated files

Proton Drive can not have two files with exactly the same name and path. If the 
conflict occurs, depending on the advanced config, the file might or might not 
be overwritten.

### [Mailbox password](https://proton.me/support/the-difference-between-the-mailbox-password-and-login-password)

Please set your mailbox password in the advanced config section.

### Caching

The cache is currently built for the case when the rclone is the only instance 
performing operations to the mount point. The event system, which is the proton
API system that provides visibility of what has changed on the drive, is yet 
to be implemented, so updates from other clients won’t be reflected in the 
cache. Thus, if there are concurrent clients accessing the same mount point, 
then we might have a problem with caching the stale data.

- Env Var:     RCLONE_PROTONDRIVE_CLIENT_SALTED_KEY_PASS
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --protondrive-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_PROTONDRIVE_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,LeftSpace,RightSpace,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --protondrive-original-file-size

Return the file size before encryption
			
The size of the encrypted file will be different from (bigger than) the 
original file size. Unless there is a reason to return the file size 
after encryption is performed, otherwise, set this option to true, as 
features like Open() which will need to be supplied with original content 
size, will fail to operate properly

Properties:

- Config:      original_file_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_PROTONDRIVE_ORIGINAL_FILE_SIZE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --protondrive-app-version

- Env Var:     RCLONE_PROTONDRIVE_APP_VERSION
- Type:        string
- Default:     "macos-drive@1.0.0-alpha.1+rclone"

#### --protondrive-replace-existing-draft

Create a new revision when filename conflict is detected

When a file upload is cancelled or failed before completion, a draft will be 
created and the subsequent upload of the same file to the same location will be 
reported as a conflict.

The value can also be set by --protondrive-replace-existing-draft=true

If the option is set to true, the draft will be replaced and then the upload 
operation will restart. If there are other clients also uploading at the same 
file location at the same time, the behavior is currently unknown. Need to set 
to true for integration tests.
If the option is set to false, an error "a draft exist - usually this means a 
file is being uploaded at another client, or, there was a failed upload attempt" 
will be returned, and no upload will happen.

Properties:

- Config:      replace_existing_draft
- Env Var:     RCLONE_PROTONDRIVE_REPLACE_EXISTING_DRAFT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --protondrive-enable-caching

Caches the files and folders metadata to reduce API calls

Notice: If you are mounting ProtonDrive as a VFS, please disable this feature, 
as the current implementation doesn't update or clear the cache when there are 
external changes. 

The files and folders on ProtonDrive are represented as links with keyrings, 
which can be cached to improve performance and be friendly to the API server.

The cache is currently built for the case when the rclone is the only instance 
performing operations to the mount point. The event system, which is the proton
API system that provides visibility of what has changed on the drive, is yet 
to be implemented, so updates from other clients won’t be reflected in the 
cache. Thus, if there are concurrent clients accessing the same mount point, 
then we might have a problem with caching the stale data.

Properties:

- Config:      enable_caching
- Env Var:     RCLONE_PROTONDRIVE_ENABLE_CACHING
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --protondrive-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_PROTONDRIVE_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false



## Limitations

This backend uses the 
[Proton-API-Bridge](https://github.com/henrybear327/Proton-API-Bridge), which 
is based on [go-proton-api](https://github.com/henrybear327/go-proton-api), a 
fork of the [official repo](https://github.com/ProtonMail/go-proton-api).

There is no official API documentation available from Proton Drive. But, thanks 
to Proton open sourcing [proton-go-api](https://github.com/ProtonMail/go-proton-api) 
and the web, iOS, and Android client codebases, we don't need to completely 
reverse engineer the APIs by observing the web client traffic! 

[proton-go-api](https://github.com/ProtonMail/go-proton-api) provides the basic 
building blocks of API calls and error handling, such as 429 exponential 
back-off, but it is pretty much just a barebone interface to the Proton API. 
For example, the encryption and decryption of the Proton Drive file are not 
provided in this library. 

The Proton-API-Bridge, attempts to bridge the gap, so rclone can be built on 
top of this quickly. This codebase handles the intricate tasks before and after 
calling Proton APIs, particularly the complex encryption scheme, allowing 
developers to implement features for other software on top of this codebase. 
There are likely quite a few errors in this library, as there isn't official 
documentation available.

#  put.io

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

put.io paths may be as deep as required, e.g.
`remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for put.io involves getting a token from put.io
which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> putio
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Put.io
   \ "putio"
[snip]
Storage> putio
** See help for putio backend at: https://rclone.org/putio/ **

Remote config
Use web browser to automatically authenticate rclone with remote?
 * Say Y if the machine running rclone has a web browser you can use
 * Say N if running rclone on a (remote) machine without web browser access
If not sure try Y. If Y failed, try N.
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
--------------------
[putio]
type = putio
token = {"access_token":"XXXXXXXX","expiry":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
putio                putio

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q
```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from put.io  if using web browser to automatically 
authenticate. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this
it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your put.io

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your put.io

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a put.io directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.


### Standard options

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_PUTIO_DESCRIPTION

## Limitations

put.io has rate limiting. When you hit a limit, rclone automatically
retries after waiting the amount of time requested by the server.

If you want to avoid ever hitting these limits, you may use the
`--tpslimit` flag with a low number. Note that the imposed limits
may be different for different operations, and may change over time.

### Duplicated files

Proton Drive can not have two files with exactly the same name and path. If the 
conflict occurs, depending on the advanced config, the file might or might not 
be overwritten.

### [Mailbox password](https://proton.me/support/the-difference-between-the-mailbox-password-and-login-password)

Please set your mailbox password in the advanced config section.

### Caching

The cache is currently built for the case when the rclone is the only instance 
performing operations to the mount point. The event system, which is the proton
API system that provides visibility of what has changed on the drive, is yet 
to be implemented, so updates from other clients won’t be reflected in the 
cache. Thus, if there are concurrent clients accessing the same mount point, 
then we might have a problem with caching the stale data.

Return the file size before encryption
			
The size of the encrypted file will be different from (bigger than) the 
original file size. Unless there is a reason to return the file size 
after encryption is performed, otherwise, set this option to true, as 
features like Open() which will need to be supplied with original content 
size, will fail to operate properly

When a file upload is cancelled or failed before completion, a draft will be 
created and the subsequent upload of the same file to the same location will be 
reported as a conflict.

The value can also be set by --protondrive-replace-existing-draft=true

If the option is set to true, the draft will be replaced and then the upload 
operation will restart. If there are other clients also uploading at the same 
file location at the same time, the behavior is currently unknown. Need to set 
to true for integration tests.
If the option is set to false, an error "a draft exist - usually this means a 
file is being uploaded at another client, or, there was a failed upload attempt" 
will be returned, and no upload will happen.

Properties:

- Config:      replace_existing_draft
- Env Var:     RCLONE_PROTONDRIVE_REPLACE_EXISTING_DRAFT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --protondrive-enable-caching

Caches the files and folders metadata to reduce API calls

Notice: If you are mounting ProtonDrive as a VFS, please disable this feature, 
as the current implementation doesn't update or clear the cache when there are 
external changes. 

The files and folders on ProtonDrive are represented as links with keyrings, 
which can be cached to improve performance and be friendly to the API server.

The cache is currently built for the case when the rclone is the only instance 
performing operations to the mount point. The event system, which is the proton
API system that provides visibility of what has changed on the drive, is yet 
to be implemented, so updates from other clients won’t be reflected in the 
cache. Thus, if there are concurrent clients accessing the same mount point, 
then we might have a problem with caching the stale data.

Properties:

- Config:      enable_caching
- Env Var:     RCLONE_PROTONDRIVE_ENABLE_CACHING
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --protondrive-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_PROTONDRIVE_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false



## Limitations

This backend uses the 
[Proton-API-Bridge](https://github.com/henrybear327/Proton-API-Bridge), which 
is based on [go-proton-api](https://github.com/henrybear327/go-proton-api), a 
fork of the [official repo](https://github.com/ProtonMail/go-proton-api).

There is no official API documentation available from Proton Drive. But, thanks 
to Proton open sourcing [proton-go-api](https://github.com/ProtonMail/go-proton-api) 
and the web, iOS, and Android client codebases, we don't need to completely 
reverse engineer the APIs by observing the web client traffic! 

[proton-go-api](https://github.com/ProtonMail/go-proton-api) provides the basic 
building blocks of API calls and error handling, such as 429 exponential 
back-off, but it is pretty much just a barebone interface to the Proton API. 
For example, the encryption and decryption of the Proton Drive file are not 
provided in this library. 

The Proton-API-Bridge, attempts to bridge the gap, so rclone can be built on 
top of this quickly. This codebase handles the intricate tasks before and after 
calling Proton APIs, particularly the complex encryption scheme, allowing 
developers to implement features for other software on top of this codebase. 
There are likely quite a few errors in this library, as there isn't official 
documentation available.

#  Seafile

This is a backend for the [Seafile](https://www.seafile.com/) storage service:
- It works with both the free community edition or the professional edition.
- Seafile versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x and 9.x are all supported.
- Encrypted libraries are also supported.
- It supports 2FA enabled users
- Using a Library API Token is **not** supported

## Configuration

There are two distinct modes you can setup your remote:
- you point your remote to the **root of the server**, meaning you don't specify a library during the configuration:
Paths are specified as `remote:library`. You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:library/path/to/dir`.
- you point your remote to a specific library during the configuration:
Paths are specified as `remote:path/to/dir`. **This is the recommended mode when using encrypted libraries**. (_This mode is possibly slightly faster than the root mode_)

### Configuration in root mode

Here is an example of making a seafile configuration for a user with **no** two-factor authentication.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process. To authenticate
you will need the URL of your server, your email (or username) and your password.

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> seafile
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value

Library password (for encrypted libraries only). Leave blank if you pass it through the command line.
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No leave this optional password blank (default)
y/g/n> n
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
Remote config
Two-factor authentication is not enabled on this account.
--------------------
[seafile]
type = seafile
url = http://my.seafile.server/
user = me@example.com
pass = *** ENCRYPTED ***
2fa = false
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

This remote is called `seafile`. It's pointing to the root of your seafile server and can now be used like this:

See all libraries

    rclone lsd seafile:

Create a new library

    rclone mkdir seafile:library

List the contents of a library

    rclone ls seafile:library

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote library, deleting any
excess files in the library.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory seafile:library

### Configuration in library mode

Here's an example of a configuration in library mode with a user that has the two-factor authentication enabled. Your 2FA code will be asked at the end of the configuration, and will attempt to authenticate you:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> seafile
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").

Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
library> My Library
Library password (for encrypted libraries only). Leave blank if you pass it through the command line.
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No leave this optional password blank (default)
y/g/n> n
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
Remote config
Two-factor authentication: please enter your 2FA code
2fa code> 123456
Authenticating...
Success!
--------------------
[seafile]
type = seafile
url = http://my.seafile.server/
user = me@example.com
pass = 
2fa = true
library = My Library
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

You'll notice your password is blank in the configuration. It's because we only need the password to authenticate you once.

You specified `My Library` during the configuration. The root of the remote is pointing at the
root of the library `My Library`:

See all files in the library:

    rclone lsd seafile:

Create a new directory inside the library

    rclone mkdir seafile:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls seafile:directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote library, deleting any
excess files in the library.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory seafile:


### --fast-list

Seafile version 7+ supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.
Please note this is not supported on seafile server version 6.x


### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| /         | 0x2F  | ／          |
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Seafile and rclone link

Rclone supports generating share links for non-encrypted libraries only.
They can either be for a file or a directory:

```
rclone link seafile:seafile-tutorial.doc
http://my.seafile.server/f/fdcd8a2f93f84b8b90f4/

```

or if run on a directory you will get:

```
rclone link seafile:dir
http://my.seafile.server/d/9ea2455f6f55478bbb0d/
```

Please note a share link is unique for each file or directory. If you run a link command on a file/dir
that has already been shared, you will get the exact same link.

### Compatibility

It has been actively developed using the [seafile docker image](https://github.com/haiwen/seafile-docker) of these versions:
- 6.3.4 community edition
- 7.0.5 community edition
- 7.1.3 community edition
- 9.0.10 community edition

Versions below 6.0 are not supported.
Versions between 6.0 and 6.3 haven't been tested and might not work properly.

Each new version of `rclone` is automatically tested against the [latest docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/seafileltd/seafile-mc/) of the seafile community server.

#  SFTP

SFTP is the [Secure (or SSH) File Transfer
Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol).

The SFTP backend can be used with a number of different providers:


- Hetzner Storage Box
- rsync.net


SFTP runs over SSH v2 and is installed as standard with most modern
SSH installations.

Paths are specified as `remote:path`. If the path does not begin with
a `/` it is relative to the home directory of the user.  An empty path
`remote:` refers to the user's home directory. For example, `rclone lsd remote:` 
would list the home directory of the user configured in the rclone remote config 
(`i.e /home/sftpuser`). However, `rclone lsd remote:/` would list the root 
directory for remote machine (i.e. `/`)

Note that some SFTP servers will need the leading / - Synology is a
good example of this. rsync.net and Hetzner, on the other hand, requires users to
OMIT the leading /.

Note that by default rclone will try to execute shell commands on
the server, see [shell access considerations](#shell-access-considerations).

## Configuration

Here is an example of making an SFTP configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / SSH/SFTP
   \ "sftp"
[snip]

SSH host to connect to
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Connect to example.com
   \ "example.com"

y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No leave this optional password blank
y/g/n> n
Path to unencrypted PEM-encoded private key file, leave blank to use ssh-agent.
key_file>
Remote config
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: sftp
- host: example.com
- user: sftpuser
- port:
- pass:
- key_file:
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this:

See all directories in the home directory

    rclone lsd remote:

See all directories in the root directory

    rclone lsd remote:/

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:path/to/directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:path/to/directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote directory, deleting any
excess files in the directory.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:directory

Mount the remote path `/srv/www-data/` to the local path
`/mnt/www-data`

    rclone mount remote:/srv/www-data/ /mnt/www-data

### SSH Authentication

The SFTP remote supports three authentication methods:

  * Password
  * Key file, including certificate signed keys
  * ssh-agent

Key files should be PEM-encoded private key files. For instance `/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa`.
Only unencrypted OpenSSH or PEM encrypted files are supported.

The key file can be specified in either an external file (key_file) or contained within the 
rclone config file (key_pem).  If using key_pem in the config file, the entry should be on a
single line with new line ('\n' or '\r\n') separating lines.  i.e.

    key_pem = -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMaMbaIXtE\n0gAMbMbaSsd\nMbaass\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

This will generate it correctly for key_pem for use in the config:

    awk '{printf "%s\\n", $0}' < ~/.ssh/id_rsa

If you don't specify `pass`, `key_file`, or `key_pem` or `ask_password` then
rclone will attempt to contact an ssh-agent. You can also specify `key_use_agent`
to force the usage of an ssh-agent. In this case `key_file` or `key_pem` can
also be specified to force the usage of a specific key in the ssh-agent.

Using an ssh-agent is the only way to load encrypted OpenSSH keys at the moment.

If you set the `ask_password` option, rclone will prompt for a password when
needed and no password has been configured.

#### Certificate-signed keys

With traditional key-based authentication, you configure your private key only,
and the public key built into it will be used during the authentication process.

If you have a certificate you may use it to sign your public key, creating a
separate SSH user certificate that should be used instead of the plain public key
extracted from the private key. Then you must provide the path to the
user certificate public key file in `pubkey_file`.

Note: This is not the traditional public key paired with your private key,
typically saved as `/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. Setting this path in
`pubkey_file` will not work.

Example:

```
[remote]
type = sftp
host = example.com
user = sftpuser
key_file = ~/id_rsa
pubkey_file = ~/id_rsa-cert.pub
````

If you concatenate a cert with a private key then you can specify the
merged file in both places.

Note: the cert must come first in the file.  e.g.

```
cat id_rsa-cert.pub id_rsa > merged_key
```

### Host key validation

By default rclone will not check the server's host key for validation.  This
can allow an attacker to replace a server with their own and if you use
password authentication then this can lead to that password being exposed.

Host key matching, using standard `known_hosts` files can be turned on by
enabling the `known_hosts_file` option.  This can point to the file maintained
by `OpenSSH` or can point to a unique file.

e.g. using the OpenSSH `known_hosts` file:

```
[remote]
type = sftp
host = example.com
user = sftpuser
pass = 
known_hosts_file = ~/.ssh/known_hosts
````

Alternatively you can create your own known hosts file like this:

```
ssh-keyscan -t dsa,rsa,ecdsa,ed25519 example.com >> known_hosts
```

There are some limitations:

* `rclone` will not _manage_ this file for you.  If the key is missing or
wrong then the connection will be refused.
* If the server is set up for a certificate host key then the entry in
the `known_hosts` file _must_ be the `@cert-authority` entry for the CA

If the host key provided by the server does not match the one in the
file (or is missing) then the connection will be aborted and an error
returned such as

    NewFs: couldn't connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: knownhosts: key mismatch

or

    NewFs: couldn't connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: knownhosts: key is unknown

If you see an error such as

    NewFs: couldn't connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: ssh: no authorities for hostname: example.com:22

then it is likely the server has presented a CA signed host certificate
and you will need to add the appropriate `@cert-authority` entry.

The `known_hosts_file` setting can be set during `rclone config` as an
advanced option.

### ssh-agent on macOS

Note that there seem to be various problems with using an ssh-agent on
macOS due to recent changes in the OS.  The most effective work-around
seems to be to start an ssh-agent in each session, e.g.

    eval `ssh-agent -s` && ssh-add -A

And then at the end of the session

    eval `ssh-agent -k`

These commands can be used in scripts of course.

### Shell access

Some functionality of the SFTP backend relies on remote shell access,
and the possibility to execute commands. This includes [checksum](#checksum),
and in some cases also [about](#about-command). The shell commands that
must be executed may be different on different type of shells, and also
quoting/escaping of file path arguments containing special characters may
be different. Rclone therefore needs to know what type of shell it is,
and if shell access is available at all.

Most servers run on some version of Unix, and then a basic Unix shell can
be assumed, without further distinction. Windows 10, Server 2019, and later
can also run a SSH server, which is a port of OpenSSH (see official
[installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)). On a Windows server the shell handling is different: Although it can also
be set up to use a Unix type shell, e.g. Cygwin bash, the default is to
use Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe), and PowerShell is a recommended
alternative. All of these have behave differently, which rclone must handle.

Rclone tries to auto-detect what type of shell is used on the server,
first time you access the SFTP remote. If a remote shell session is
successfully created, it will look for indications that it is CMD or
PowerShell, with fall-back to Unix if not something else is detected.
If unable to even create a remote shell session, then shell command
execution will be disabled entirely. The result is stored in the SFTP
remote configuration, in option `shell_type`, so that the auto-detection
only have to be performed once. If you manually set a value for this
option before first run, the auto-detection will be skipped, and if
you set a different value later this will override any existing.
Value `none` can be set to avoid any attempts at executing shell
commands, e.g. if this is not allowed on the server.
If you have `shell_type = none` in the configuration then
the [ssh](#sftp-ssh) must not be set.

When the server is [rclone serve sftp](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_sftp/),
the rclone SFTP remote will detect this as a Unix type shell - even
if it is running on Windows. This server does not actually have a shell,
but it accepts input commands matching the specific ones that the
SFTP backend relies on for Unix shells, e.g. `md5sum` and `df`. Also
it handles the string escape rules used for Unix shell. Treating it
as a Unix type shell from a SFTP remote will therefore always be
correct, and support all features.

#### Shell access considerations

The shell type auto-detection logic, described above, means that
by default rclone will try to run a shell command the first time
a new sftp remote is accessed. If you configure a sftp remote
without a config file, e.g. an [on the fly](https://rclone.org/docs/#backend-path-to-dir])
remote, rclone will have nowhere to store the result, and it
will re-run the command on every access. To avoid this you should
explicitly set the `shell_type` option to the correct value,
or to `none` if you want to prevent rclone from executing any
remote shell commands.

It is also important to note that, since the shell type decides
how quoting and escaping of file paths used as command-line arguments
are performed, configuring the wrong shell type may leave you exposed
to command injection exploits. Make sure to confirm the auto-detected
shell type, or explicitly set the shell type you know is correct,
or disable shell access until you know.

### Checksum

SFTP does not natively support checksums (file hash), but rclone
is able to use checksumming if the same login has shell access,
and can execute remote commands. If there is a command that can
calculate compatible checksums on the remote system, Rclone can
then be configured to execute this whenever a checksum is needed,
and read back the results. Currently MD5 and SHA-1 are supported.

Normally this requires an external utility being available on
the server. By default rclone will try commands `md5sum`, `md5`
and `rclone md5sum` for MD5 checksums, and the first one found usable
will be picked. Same with `sha1sum`, `sha1` and `rclone sha1sum`
commands for SHA-1 checksums. These utilities normally need to
be in the remote's PATH to be found.

In some cases the shell itself is capable of calculating checksums.
PowerShell is an example of such a shell. If rclone detects that the
remote shell is PowerShell, which means it most probably is a
Windows OpenSSH server, rclone will use a predefined script block
to produce the checksums when no external checksum commands are found
(see [shell access](#shell-access)). This assumes PowerShell version
4.0 or newer.

The options `md5sum_command` and `sha1_command` can be used to customize
the command to be executed for calculation of checksums. You can for
example set a specific path to where md5sum and sha1sum executables
are located, or use them to specify some other tools that print checksums
in compatible format. The value can include command-line arguments,
or even shell script blocks as with PowerShell. Rclone has subcommands
[md5sum](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_md5sum/) and [sha1sum](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sha1sum/)
that use compatible format, which means if you have an rclone executable
on the server it can be used. As mentioned above, they will be automatically
picked up if found in PATH, but if not you can set something like
`/path/to/rclone md5sum` as the value of option `md5sum_command` to
make sure a specific executable is used.

Remote checksumming is recommended and enabled by default. First time
rclone is using a SFTP remote, if options `md5sum_command` or `sha1_command`
are not set, it will check if any of the default commands for each of them,
as described above, can be used. The result will be saved in the remote
configuration, so next time it will use the same. Value `none`
will be set if none of the default commands could be used for a specific
algorithm, and this algorithm will not be supported by the remote.

Disabling the checksumming may be required if you are connecting to SFTP servers
which are not under your control, and to which the execution of remote shell
commands is prohibited.  Set the configuration option `disable_hashcheck`
to `true` to disable checksumming entirely, or set `shell_type` to `none`
to disable all functionality based on remote shell command execution.

### Modification times and hashes

Modified times are stored on the server to 1 second precision.

Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported.

Some SFTP servers disable setting/modifying the file modification time after
upload (for example, certain configurations of ProFTPd with mod_sftp). If you
are using one of these servers, you can set the option `set_modtime = false` in
your RClone backend configuration to disable this behaviour.

### About command

The `about` command returns the total space, free space, and used
space on the remote for the disk of the specified path on the remote or,
if not set, the disk of the root on the remote.

SFTP usually supports the [about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/) command, but
it depends on the server. If the server implements the vendor-specific
VFS statistics extension, which is normally the case with OpenSSH instances,
it will be used. If not, but the same login has access to a Unix shell,
where the `df` command is available (e.g. in the remote's PATH), then
this will be used instead. If the server shell is PowerShell, probably
with a Windows OpenSSH server, rclone will use a built-in shell command
(see [shell access](#shell-access)). If none of the above is applicable,
`about` will fail.


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to sftp (SSH/SFTP).

#### --sftp-host

SSH host to connect to.

E.g. "example.com".

Properties:

- Config:      host
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_HOST
- Type:        string
- Required:    true

#### --sftp-user

SSH username.

Properties:

- Config:      user
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_USER
- Type:        string
- Default:     "$USER"

#### --sftp-port

SSH port number.

Properties:

- Config:      port
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_PORT
- Type:        int
- Default:     22

#### --sftp-pass

SSH password, leave blank to use ssh-agent.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

Properties:

- Config:      pass
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_PASS
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-key-pem

Raw PEM-encoded private key.

Note that this should be on a single line with line endings replaced with '\n', eg

    key_pem = -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMaMbaIXtE\n0gAMbMbaSsd\nMbaass\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

This will generate the single line correctly:

    awk '{printf "%s\\n", $0}' < ~/.ssh/id_rsa

If specified, it will override the key_file parameter.

Properties:

- Config:      key_pem
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_PEM
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-key-file

Path to PEM-encoded private key file.

Leave blank or set key-use-agent to use ssh-agent.

Leading `~` will be expanded in the file name as will environment variables such as `${RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR}`.

Properties:

- Config:      key_file
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_FILE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-key-file-pass

The passphrase to decrypt the PEM-encoded private key file.

Only PEM encrypted key files (old OpenSSH format) are supported. Encrypted keys
in the new OpenSSH format can't be used.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

Properties:

- Config:      key_file_pass
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_FILE_PASS
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-pubkey-file

Optional path to public key file.

Set this if you have a signed certificate you want to use for authentication.

Leading `~` will be expanded in the file name as will environment variables such as `${RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR}`.

Properties:

- Config:      pubkey_file
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_PUBKEY_FILE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-key-use-agent

When set forces the usage of the ssh-agent.

When key-file is also set, the ".pub" file of the specified key-file is read and only the associated key is
requested from the ssh-agent. This allows to avoid `Too many authentication failures for *username*` errors
when the ssh-agent contains many keys.

Properties:

- Config:      key_use_agent
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_USE_AGENT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-use-insecure-cipher

Enable the use of insecure ciphers and key exchange methods.

This enables the use of the following insecure ciphers and key exchange methods:

- aes128-cbc
- aes192-cbc
- aes256-cbc
- 3des-cbc
- diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256
- diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1

Those algorithms are insecure and may allow plaintext data to be recovered by an attacker.

This must be false if you use either ciphers or key_exchange advanced options.


Properties:

- Config:      use_insecure_cipher
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_USE_INSECURE_CIPHER
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false
- Examples:
    - "false"
        - Use default Cipher list.
    - "true"
        - Enables the use of the aes128-cbc cipher and diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256, diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 key exchange.

#### --sftp-disable-hashcheck

Disable the execution of SSH commands to determine if remote file hashing is available.

Leave blank or set to false to enable hashing (recommended), set to true to disable hashing.

Properties:

- Config:      disable_hashcheck
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_DISABLE_HASHCHECK
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-ssh

Path and arguments to external ssh binary.

Normally rclone will use its internal ssh library to connect to the
SFTP server. However it does not implement all possible ssh options so
it may be desirable to use an external ssh binary.

Rclone ignores all the internal config if you use this option and
expects you to configure the ssh binary with the user/host/port and
any other options you need.

**Important** The ssh command must log in without asking for a
password so needs to be configured with keys or certificates.

Rclone will run the command supplied either with the additional
arguments "-s sftp" to access the SFTP subsystem or with commands such
as "md5sum /path/to/file" appended to read checksums.

Any arguments with spaces in should be surrounded by "double quotes".

An example setting might be:

    ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=20 user@example.com

Note that when using an external ssh binary rclone makes a new ssh
connection for every hash it calculates.


Properties:

- Config:      ssh
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SSH
- Type:        SpaceSepList
- Default:     

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to sftp (SSH/SFTP).

#### --sftp-known-hosts-file

Optional path to known_hosts file.

Set this value to enable server host key validation.

Leading `~` will be expanded in the file name as will environment variables such as `${RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR}`.

Properties:

- Config:      known_hosts_file
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false
- Examples:
    - "~/.ssh/known_hosts"
        - Use OpenSSH's known_hosts file.

#### --sftp-ask-password

Allow asking for SFTP password when needed.

If this is set and no password is supplied then rclone will:
- ask for a password
- not contact the ssh agent


Properties:

- Config:      ask_password
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_ASK_PASSWORD
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-path-override

Override path used by SSH shell commands.

This allows checksum calculation when SFTP and SSH paths are
different. This issue affects among others Synology NAS boxes.

E.g. if shared folders can be found in directories representing volumes:

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/directory --sftp-path-override /volume2/directory

E.g. if home directory can be found in a shared folder called "home":

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/home/directory --sftp-path-override /volume1/homes/USER/directory
	
To specify only the path to the SFTP remote's root, and allow rclone to add any relative subpaths automatically (including unwrapping/decrypting remotes as necessary), add the '@' character to the beginning of the path.

E.g. the first example above could be rewritten as:

	rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/directory --sftp-path-override @/volume2
	
Note that when using this method with Synology "home" folders, the full "/homes/USER" path should be specified instead of "/home".

E.g. the second example above should be rewritten as:

	rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/homes/USER/directory --sftp-path-override @/volume1

Properties:

- Config:      path_override
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_PATH_OVERRIDE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-set-modtime

Set the modified time on the remote if set.

Properties:

- Config:      set_modtime
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SET_MODTIME
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --sftp-shell-type

The type of SSH shell on remote server, if any.

Leave blank for autodetect.

Properties:

- Config:      shell_type
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SHELL_TYPE
- Type:        string
- Required:    false
- Examples:
    - "none"
        - No shell access
    - "unix"
        - Unix shell
    - "powershell"
        - PowerShell
    - "cmd"
        - Windows Command Prompt

#### --sftp-md5sum-command

The command used to read md5 hashes.

Leave blank for autodetect.

Properties:

- Config:      md5sum_command
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_MD5SUM_COMMAND
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-sha1sum-command

The command used to read sha1 hashes.

Leave blank for autodetect.

Properties:

- Config:      sha1sum_command
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SHA1SUM_COMMAND
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-skip-links

Set to skip any symlinks and any other non regular files.

Properties:

- Config:      skip_links
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SKIP_LINKS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-subsystem

Specifies the SSH2 subsystem on the remote host.

Properties:

- Config:      subsystem
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SUBSYSTEM
- Type:        string
- Default:     "sftp"

#### --sftp-server-command

Specifies the path or command to run a sftp server on the remote host.

The subsystem option is ignored when server_command is defined.

If adding server_command to the configuration file please note that 
it should not be enclosed in quotes, since that will make rclone fail.

A working example is:

    [remote_name]
    type = sftp
    server_command = sudo /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server

Properties:

- Config:      server_command
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SERVER_COMMAND
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-use-fstat

If set use fstat instead of stat.

Some servers limit the amount of open files and calling Stat after opening
the file will throw an error from the server. Setting this flag will call
Fstat instead of Stat which is called on an already open file handle.

It has been found that this helps with IBM Sterling SFTP servers which have
"extractability" level set to 1 which means only 1 file can be opened at
any given time.


Properties:

- Config:      use_fstat
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_USE_FSTAT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-disable-concurrent-reads

If set don't use concurrent reads.

Normally concurrent reads are safe to use and not using them will
degrade performance, so this option is disabled by default.

Some servers limit the amount number of times a file can be
downloaded. Using concurrent reads can trigger this limit, so if you
have a server which returns

    Failed to copy: file does not exist

Then you may need to enable this flag.

If concurrent reads are disabled, the use_fstat option is ignored.


Properties:

- Config:      disable_concurrent_reads
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_DISABLE_CONCURRENT_READS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-disable-concurrent-writes

If set don't use concurrent writes.

Normally rclone uses concurrent writes to upload files. This improves
the performance greatly, especially for distant servers.

This option disables concurrent writes should that be necessary.


Properties:

- Config:      disable_concurrent_writes
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_DISABLE_CONCURRENT_WRITES
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-idle-timeout

Max time before closing idle connections.

If no connections have been returned to the connection pool in the time
given, rclone will empty the connection pool.

Set to 0 to keep connections indefinitely.


Properties:

- Config:      idle_timeout
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_IDLE_TIMEOUT
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --sftp-chunk-size

Upload and download chunk size.

This controls the maximum size of payload in SFTP protocol packets.
The RFC limits this to 32768 bytes (32k), which is the default. However,
a lot of servers support larger sizes, typically limited to a maximum
total package size of 256k, and setting it larger will increase transfer
speed dramatically on high latency links. This includes OpenSSH, and,
for example, using the value of 255k works well, leaving plenty of room
for overhead while still being within a total packet size of 256k.

Make sure to test thoroughly before using a value higher than 32k,
and only use it if you always connect to the same server or after
sufficiently broad testing. If you get errors such as
"failed to send packet payload: EOF", lots of "connection lost",
or "corrupted on transfer", when copying a larger file, try lowering
the value. The server run by [rclone serve sftp](/commands/rclone_serve_sftp)
sends packets with standard 32k maximum payload so you must not
set a different chunk_size when downloading files, but it accepts
packets up to the 256k total size, so for uploads the chunk_size
can be set as for the OpenSSH example above.


Properties:

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     32Ki

#### --sftp-concurrency

The maximum number of outstanding requests for one file

This controls the maximum number of outstanding requests for one file.
Increasing it will increase throughput on high latency links at the
cost of using more memory.


Properties:

- Config:      concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     64

#### --sftp-connections

Maximum number of SFTP simultaneous connections, 0 for unlimited.

Note that setting this is very likely to cause deadlocks so it should
be used with care.

If you are doing a sync or copy then make sure connections is one more
than the sum of `--transfers` and `--checkers`.

If you use `--check-first` then it just needs to be one more than the
maximum of `--checkers` and `--transfers`.

So for `connections 3` you'd use `--checkers 2 --transfers 2
--check-first` or `--checkers 1 --transfers 1`.



Properties:

- Config:      connections
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_CONNECTIONS
- Type:        int
- Default:     0

#### --sftp-set-env

Environment variables to pass to sftp and commands

Set environment variables in the form:

    VAR=value

to be passed to the sftp client and to any commands run (eg md5sum).

Pass multiple variables space separated, eg

    VAR1=value VAR2=value

and pass variables with spaces in quotes, eg

    "VAR3=value with space" "VAR4=value with space" VAR5=nospacehere



Properties:

- Config:      set_env
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SET_ENV
- Type:        SpaceSepList
- Default:     

#### --sftp-ciphers

Space separated list of ciphers to be used for session encryption, ordered by preference.

At least one must match with server configuration. This can be checked for example using ssh -Q cipher.

This must not be set if use_insecure_cipher is true.

Example:

    aes128-ctr aes192-ctr aes256-ctr aes128-gcm@openssh.com aes256-gcm@openssh.com


Properties:

- Config:      ciphers
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_CIPHERS
- Type:        SpaceSepList
- Default:     

#### --sftp-key-exchange

Space separated list of key exchange algorithms, ordered by preference.

At least one must match with server configuration. This can be checked for example using ssh -Q kex.

This must not be set if use_insecure_cipher is true.

Example:

    sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com curve25519-sha256 curve25519-sha256@libssh.org ecdh-sha2-nistp256


Properties:

- Config:      key_exchange
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_EXCHANGE
- Type:        SpaceSepList
- Default:     

#### --sftp-macs

Space separated list of MACs (message authentication code) algorithms, ordered by preference.

At least one must match with server configuration. This can be checked for example using ssh -Q mac.

Example:

    umac-64-etm@openssh.com umac-128-etm@openssh.com hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com


Properties:

- Config:      macs
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_MACS
- Type:        SpaceSepList
- Default:     

#### --sftp-host-key-algorithms

Space separated list of host key algorithms, ordered by preference.

At least one must match with server configuration. This can be checked for example using ssh -Q HostKeyAlgorithms.

Note: This can affect the outcome of key negotiation with the server even if server host key validation is not enabled.

Example:

    ssh-ed25519 ssh-rsa ssh-dss


Properties:

- Config:      host_key_algorithms
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_HOST_KEY_ALGORITHMS
- Type:        SpaceSepList
- Default:     

#### --sftp-socks-proxy

Socks 5 proxy host.
	
Supports the format user:pass@host:port, user@host:port, host:port.

Example:

	myUser:myPass@localhost:9005
	

Properties:

- Config:      socks_proxy
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SOCKS_PROXY
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --sftp-copy-is-hardlink

Set to enable server side copies using hardlinks.

The SFTP protocol does not define a copy command so normally server
side copies are not allowed with the sftp backend.

However the SFTP protocol does support hardlinking, and if you enable
this flag then the sftp backend will support server side copies. These
will be implemented by doing a hardlink from the source to the
destination.

Not all sftp servers support this.

Note that hardlinking two files together will use no additional space
as the source and the destination will be the same file.

This feature may be useful backups made with --copy-dest.

Properties:

- Config:      copy_is_hardlink
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_COPY_IS_HARDLINK
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false



## Limitations

On some SFTP servers (e.g. Synology) the paths are different
for SSH and SFTP so the hashes can't be calculated properly.
For them using `disable_hashcheck` is a good idea.

The only ssh agent supported under Windows is Putty's pageant.

The Go SSH library disables the use of the aes128-cbc cipher by
default, due to security concerns. This can be re-enabled on a
per-connection basis by setting the `use_insecure_cipher` setting in
the configuration file to `true`. Further details on the insecurity of
this cipher can be found
[in this paper](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/SandPfinal.pdf).

SFTP isn't supported under plan9 until [this
issue](https://github.com/pkg/sftp/issues/156) is fixed.

Note that since SFTP isn't HTTP based the following flags don't work
with it: `--dump-headers`, `--dump-bodies`, `--dump-auth`.

Note that `--timeout` and `--contimeout` are both supported.

## rsync.net {#rsync-net}

rsync.net is supported through the SFTP backend.

#  SMB

SMB is [a communication protocol to share files over network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block).

This relies on [go-smb2 library](https://github.com/hirochachacha/go-smb2/) for communication with SMB protocol.

Paths are specified as `remote:sharename` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:item/path/to/dir`.

## Notes

The first path segment must be the name of the share, which you entered when you started to share on Windows. On smbd, it's the section title in `smb.conf` (usually in `/etc/samba/`) file.
You can find shares by querying the root if you're unsure (e.g. `rclone lsd remote:`).

You can't access to the shared printers from rclone, obviously.

You can't use Anonymous access for logging in. You have to use the `guest` user with an empty password instead.
The rclone client tries to avoid 8.3 names when uploading files by encoding trailing spaces and periods.
Alternatively, [the local backend](https://rclone.org/local/#paths-on-windows) on Windows can access SMB servers using UNC paths, by `\\server\share`. This doesn't apply to non-Windows OSes, such as Linux and macOS.

## Configuration

Here is an example of making a SMB configuration.

First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

#  Storj

[Storj](https://storj.io) is redefining the cloud to support the
future of data—sustainably and economically. Storj leverages the vast
global supply of underutilized resources to deliver better security,
durability, and performance services. Experience up to 90% lower costs
and carbon reduction with Storj.

Storj is an encrypted, secure, and cost-effective object storage service
that enables you to store, back up, and archive large amounts of data
in a decentralized manner.

## Backend options

Storj can be used both with this native backend and with the [s3
backend using the Storj S3 compatible gateway](https://rclone.org/s3/#storj) (shared or private).

Use this backend to take advantage of client-side encryption as well
as to achieve the best possible download performance. Uploads will be
erasure-coded locally, thus a 1gb upload will result in 2.68gb of data
being uploaded to storage nodes across the network.

Use the s3 backend and one of the S3 compatible Hosted Gateways to
increase upload performance and reduce the load on your systems and
network. Uploads will be encrypted and erasure-coded server-side, thus
a 1GB upload will result in only in 1GB of data being uploaded to
storage nodes across the network.

Side by side comparison with more details:

* Characteristics:
  * *Storj backend*: Uses native RPC protocol, connects directly
    to the storage nodes which hosts the data. Requires more CPU
    resource of encoding/decoding and has network amplification
    (especially during the upload), uses lots of TCP connections
  * *S3 backend*: Uses S3 compatible HTTP Rest API via the shared
    gateways. There is no network amplification, but performance
    depends on the shared gateways and the secret encryption key is
    shared with the gateway.
* Typical usage:
  * *Storj backend*: Server environments and desktops with enough
    resources, internet speed and connectivity - and applications
    where storjs client-side encryption is required.
  * *S3 backend*: Desktops and similar with limited resources,
    internet speed or connectivity.
* Security:
  * *Storj backend*: __strong__. Private encryption key doesn't
    need to leave the local computer.
  * *S3 backend*: __weaker__. Private encryption key is [shared
    with](https://docs.storj.io/dcs/api-reference/s3-compatible-gateway#security-and-encryption)
    the authentication service of the hosted gateway, where it's
    stored encrypted. It can be stronger when combining with the
    rclone [crypt](/crypt) backend.
* Bandwidth usage (upload):
  * *Storj backend*: __higher__. As data is erasure coded on the
    client side both the original data and the parities should be
    uploaded. About ~2.7 times more data is required to be uploaded.
    Client may start to upload with even higher number of nodes (~3.7
    times more) and abandon/stop the slow uploads.
  * *S3 backend*: __normal__. Only the raw data is uploaded, erasure
    coding happens on the gateway.
* Bandwidth usage (download)
  * *Storj backend*: __almost normal__. Only the minimal number
    of data is required, but to avoid very slow data providers a few
    more sources are used and the slowest are ignored (max 1.2x
    overhead).
  * *S3 backend*: __normal__. Only the raw data is downloaded, erasure coding happens on the shared gateway.
* CPU usage:
  * *Storj backend*: __higher__, but more predictable. Erasure
    code and encryption/decryption happens locally which requires
    significant CPU usage.
  * *S3 backend*: __less__. Erasure code and encryption/decryption
    happens on shared s3 gateways (and as is, it depends on the
    current load on the gateways)
* TCP connection usage:
  * *Storj backend*: __high__. A direct connection is required to
    each of the Storj nodes resulting in 110 connections on upload and
    35 on download per 64 MB segment. Not all the connections are
    actively used (slow ones are pruned), but they are all opened.
    [Adjusting the max open file limit](https://rclone.org/storj/#known-issues) may
    be required.
  * *S3 backend*: __normal__. Only one connection per download/upload
    thread is required to the shared gateway.
* Overall performance:
  * *Storj backend*: with enough resources (CPU and bandwidth)
    *storj* backend can provide even 2x better performance. Data
    is directly downloaded to / uploaded from to the client instead of
    the gateway.
  * *S3 backend*: Can be faster on edge devices where CPU and network
    bandwidth is limited as the shared S3 compatible gateways take
    care about the encrypting/decryption and erasure coding and no
    download/upload amplification.
* Decentralization:
  * *Storj backend*: __high__. Data is downloaded directly from
    the distributed cloud of storage providers.
  * *S3 backend*: __low__. Requires a running S3 gateway (either
    self-hosted or Storj-hosted).
* Limitations:
  * *Storj backend*: `rclone checksum` is not possible without
    download, as checksum metadata is not calculated during upload
  * *S3 backend*: secret encryption key is shared with the gateway

## Configuration

To make a new Storj configuration you need one of the following:
* Access Grant that someone else shared with you.
* [API Key](https://documentation.storj.io/getting-started/uploading-your-first-object/create-an-api-key)
of a Storj project you are a member of.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_STORJ_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false



## Usage

Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsf`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this.

### Create a new bucket

Use the `mkdir` command to create new bucket, e.g. `bucket`.

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

### List all buckets

Use the `lsf` command to list all buckets.

    rclone lsf remote:

Note the colon (`:`) character at the end of the command line.

### Delete a bucket

Use the `rmdir` command to delete an empty bucket.

    rclone rmdir remote:bucket

Use the `purge` command to delete a non-empty bucket with all its content.

    rclone purge remote:bucket

### Upload objects

Use the `copy` command to upload an object.

    rclone copy --progress /home/local/directory/file.ext remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

The `--progress` flag is for displaying progress information.
Remove it if you don't need this information.

Use a folder in the local path to upload all its objects.

    rclone copy --progress /home/local/directory/ remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

Only modified files will be copied.

### List objects

Use the `ls` command to list recursively all objects in a bucket.

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Add the folder to the remote path to list recursively all objects in this folder.

    rclone ls remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

Use the `lsf` command to list non-recursively all objects in a bucket or a folder.

    rclone lsf remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

### Download objects

Use the `copy` command to download an object.

    rclone copy --progress remote:bucket/path/to/dir/file.ext /home/local/directory/

The `--progress` flag is for displaying progress information.
Remove it if you don't need this information.

Use a folder in the remote path to download all its objects.

    rclone copy --progress remote:bucket/path/to/dir/ /home/local/directory/

### Delete objects

Use the `deletefile` command to delete a single object.

    rclone deletefile remote:bucket/path/to/dir/file.ext

Use the `delete` command to delete all object in a folder.

    rclone delete remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

### Print the total size of objects

Use the `size` command to print the total size of objects in a bucket or a folder.

    rclone size remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

### Sync two Locations

Use the `sync` command to sync the source to the destination,
changing the destination only, deleting any excess files.

    rclone sync --interactive --progress /home/local/directory/ remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

The `--progress` flag is for displaying progress information.
Remove it if you don't need this information.

Since this can cause data loss, test first with the `--dry-run` flag
to see exactly what would be copied and deleted.

The sync can be done also from Storj to the local file system.

    rclone sync --interactive --progress remote:bucket/path/to/dir/ /home/local/directory/

Or between two Storj buckets.

    rclone sync --interactive --progress remote-us:bucket/path/to/dir/ remote-europe:bucket/path/to/dir/

Or even between another cloud storage and Storj.

    rclone sync --interactive --progress s3:bucket/path/to/dir/ storj:bucket/path/to/dir/

## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the rclone Storj backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) and [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

## Known issues

If you get errors like `too many open files` this usually happens when the default `ulimit` for system max open files is exceeded. Native Storj protocol opens a large number of TCP connections (each of which is counted as an open file). For a single upload stream you can expect 110 TCP connections to be opened. For a single download stream you can expect 35. This batch of connections will be opened for every 64 MiB segment and you should also expect TCP connections to be reused. If you do many transfers you eventually open a connection to most storage nodes (thousands of nodes).

To fix these, please raise your system limits. You can do this issuing a `ulimit -n 65536` just before you run rclone. To change the limits more permanently you can add this to your shell startup script, e.g. `$HOME/.bashrc`, or change the system-wide configuration, usually `/etc/sysctl.conf` and/or `/etc/security/limits.conf`, but please refer to your operating system manual.

#  SugarSync

[SugarSync](https://sugarsync.com) is a cloud service that enables
active synchronization of files across computers and other devices for
file backup, access, syncing, and sharing.

## Configuration

The initial setup for SugarSync involves getting a token from SugarSync which you
can do with rclone. `rclone config` walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Sugarsync
   \ "sugarsync"
[snip]
Storage> sugarsync
** See help for sugarsync backend at: https://rclone.org/sugarsync/ **

Sugarsync App ID.
Leave blank to use rclone's.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").

Sugarsync Private Access Key
Leave blank to use rclone's.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
private_access_key> 
Permanently delete files if true
otherwise put them in the deleted files.
Enter a boolean value (true or false). Press Enter for the default ("false").
hard_delete> 
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
Remote config
Username (email address)> nick@craig-wood.com
Your Sugarsync password is only required during setup and will not be stored.
password:
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: sugarsync
- refresh_token: https://api.sugarsync.com/app-authorization/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Note that the config asks for your email and password but doesn't
store them, it only uses them to get the initial token.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories (sync folders) in top level of your SugarSync

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your SugarSync folder "Test"

    rclone ls remote:Test

To copy a local directory to an SugarSync folder called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

**NB** you can't create files in the top level folder you have to
create a folder, which rclone will create as a "Sync Folder" with
SugarSync.

### Modification times and hashes

SugarSync does not support modification times or hashes, therefore
syncing will default to `--size-only` checking.  Note that using
`--update` will work as rclone can read the time files were uploaded.

### Restricted filename characters

SugarSync replaces the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
except for DEL.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in XML strings.

### Deleting files

Deleted files will be moved to the "Deleted items" folder by default.

However you can supply the flag `--sugarsync-hard-delete` or set the
config parameter `hard_delete = true` if you would like files to be
deleted straight away.

## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the SugarSync backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) and [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Uloz.to

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

The initial setup for Uloz.to involves filling in the user credentials. 
`rclone config` walks you through it.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Uloz.to
   \ "ulozto"
[snip]
Storage> ulozto

Option app_token.
The application token identifying the app. An app API key can be either found in the API doc 
https://uloz.to/upload-resumable-api-beta or obtained from customer service.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
app_token> token_value

Option username.
The username of the principal to operate as.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
username> user

Option password.
The password for the user.
Choose an alternative below. Press Enter for the default (n).
y) Yes, type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No, leave this optional password blank (default)
y/g/n> y
Enter the password:
password:
Confirm the password:
password:

Edit advanced config?
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n

Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List folders in root level folder:

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your root folder:

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local folder to a Uloz.to folder called backup:

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### User credentials

The only reliable method is to authenticate the user using 
username and password. Uloz.to offers an API key as well, but 
it's reserved for the use of Uloz.to's in-house application
and using it in different circumstances is unreliable. 

### Modification times and hashes

Uloz.to doesn't allow the user to set a custom modification time,
or retrieve the hashes after upload. As a result, the integration
uses a free form field the API provides to encode client-provided
timestamps and hashes. Timestamps are stored with microsecond 
precision. 

A server calculated MD5 hash of the file is verified upon upload. 
Afterwards, the backend only serves the client-side calculated
hashes. Hashes can also be retrieved upon creating a file download
link, but it's impractical for `list`-like use cases.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Transfers

All files are currently uploaded using a single HTTP request, so 
for uploading large files a stable connection is necessary.  Rclone will
upload up to `--transfers` chunks at the same time (shared among all 
uploads).

### Deleting files

By default, files are moved to the recycle bin whereas folders
are deleted immediately. Trashed files are permanently deleted after
30 days in the recycle bin. 

Emptying the trash is currently not implemented in rclone.

### Root folder ID

You can set the `root_folder_slug` for rclone.  This is the folder
(identified by its `Folder slug`) that rclone considers to be the root
of your Uloz.to drive.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the
correct root to use itself. However you can set this to restrict rclone
to a specific folder hierarchy.

In order to do this you will have to find the `Folder slug` of the
folder you wish to use as root.  This will be the last segment
of the URL when you open the relevant folder in the Uloz.to web
interface.

For example, for exploring a folder with URL 
`https://uloz.to/fm/my-files/foobar`, `foobar` should be used as the 
root slug.

`root_folder_slug` can be used alongside a specific path in the remote 
path. For example, if your remote's `root_folder_slug` corresponds to `/foo/bar`, 
`remote:baz/qux` will refer to `ABSOLUTE_ULOZTO_ROOT/foo/bar/baz/qux`.


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to ulozto (Uloz.to).

#### --ulozto-app-token

The application token identifying the app. An app API key can be either found in the API
doc https://uloz.to/upload-resumable-api-beta or obtained from customer service.

Properties:

- Config:      app_token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ULOZTO_APP_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --ulozto-username

The username of the principal to operate as.

Properties:

- Config:      username
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ULOZTO_USERNAME
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --ulozto-password

The password for the user.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

Properties:

- Config:      password
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ULOZTO_PASSWORD
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to ulozto (Uloz.to).

#### --ulozto-root-folder-slug

If set, rclone will use this folder as the root folder for all operations. For example,
if the slug identifies 'foo/bar/', 'ulozto:baz' is equivalent to 'ulozto:foo/bar/baz' without
any root slug set.

Properties:

- Config:      root_folder_slug
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ULOZTO_ROOT_FOLDER_SLUG
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

#### --ulozto-list-page-size

The size of a single page for list commands. 1-500

Properties:

- Config:      list_page_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ULOZTO_LIST_PAGE_SIZE
- Type:        int
- Default:     500

#### --ulozto-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ULOZTO_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --ulozto-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ULOZTO_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false



## Limitations

Uloz.to file names can't have the `\` character in.  rclone maps this to
and from an identical looking unicode equivalent `＼` (U+FF3C Fullwidth
Reverse Solidus).

Uloz.to only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.

Uloz.to rate limits access to the API, but exact details are undisclosed. 
Practical testing reveals that hitting the rate limit during normal use
is very rare, although not impossible with higher number of concurrently 
uploaded files.

`rclone about` is not supported by the Uloz.to backend. Although 
there's an endpoint to retrieve the information for the UI, it's not 
exposed in the API.  Backends without this capability cannot determine 
free space for an rclone mount or use policy `mfs` (most free space) 
as a member of an rclone union remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) and [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Uptobox

This is a Backend for Uptobox file storage service. Uptobox is closer to a one-click hoster than a traditional 
cloud storage provider and therefore not suitable for long term storage. 

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

To configure an Uptobox backend you'll need your personal api token. You'll find it in your
[account settings](https://uptobox.com/my_account)

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote` with the default setup.  First run:

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
TestUptobox          uptobox

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> n
name> uptobox
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[...]
37 / Uptobox
   \ "uptobox"
[...]
Storage> uptobox
** See help for uptobox backend at: https://rclone.org/uptobox/ **

Your API Key, get it from https://uptobox.com/my_account
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
api_key> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
Remote config
--------------------
[uptobox]
type = uptobox
api_key = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> 
```
Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Uptobox

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Uptobox

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Uptobox directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modification times and hashes

Uptobox supports neither modified times nor checksums. All timestamps
will read as that set by `--default-time`.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| `         | 0x41  | ｀          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in XML strings.


### Standard options

Here are the Standard options specific to uptobox (Uptobox).

#### --uptobox-access-token

Your access token.

Get it from https://uptobox.com/my_account.

Properties:

- Config:      access_token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_UPTOBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to uptobox (Uptobox).

#### --uptobox-private

Set to make uploaded files private

Properties:

- Config:      private
- Env Var:     RCLONE_UPTOBOX_PRIVATE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --uptobox-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_UPTOBOX_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,BackQuote,Del,Ctl,LeftSpace,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --uptobox-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_UPTOBOX_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false



## Limitations

Uptobox will delete inactive files that have not been accessed in 60 days.

`rclone about` is not supported by this backend an overview of used space can however
been seen in the uptobox web interface.

#  Union

The `union` backend joins several remotes together to make a single unified view of them.

During the initial setup with `rclone config` you will specify the upstream
remotes as a space separated list. The upstream remotes can either be a local
paths or other remotes.

The attributes `:ro`, `:nc` and `:writeback` can be attached to the end of the remote
to tag the remote as **read only**, **no create** or **writeback**, e.g.
`remote:directory/subdirectory:ro` or `remote:directory/subdirectory:nc`.

- `:ro` means files will only be read from here and never written
- `:nc` means new files or directories won't be created here
- `:writeback` means files found in different remotes will be written back here. See the [writeback section](#writeback) for more info.

Subfolders can be used in upstream remotes. Assume a union remote named `backup`
with the remotes `mydrive:private/backup`. Invoking `rclone mkdir backup:desktop`
is exactly the same as invoking `rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/desktop`.

There is no special handling of paths containing `..` segments. Invoking `rclone
mkdir backup:../desktop` is exactly the same as invoking `rclone mkdir
mydrive:private/backup/../desktop`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a union called `remote` for local folders.
First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

Options:
- type: union
- upstreams: remote1:dir1 remote2:dir2 remote3:dir3
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
remote               union

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level in `remote1:dir1`, `remote2:dir2` and `remote3:dir3`

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in `remote1:dir1`, `remote2:dir2` and `remote3:dir3`

    rclone ls remote:

Copy another local directory to the union directory called source, which will be placed into `remote3:dir3`

    rclone copy C:\source remote:source

### Behavior / Policies

The behavior of union backend is inspired by [trapexit/mergerfs](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs). All functions are grouped into 3 categories: **action**, **create** and **search**. These functions and categories can be assigned a policy which dictates what file or directory is chosen when performing that behavior. Any policy can be assigned to a function or category though some may not be very useful in practice. For instance: **rand** (random) may be useful for file creation (create) but could lead to very odd behavior if used for `delete` if there were more than one copy of the file.

### Function / Category classifications

| Category | Description              | Functions                                                                           |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| action   | Writing Existing file    | move, rmdir, rmdirs, delete, purge and copy, sync (as destination when file exist)  |
| create   | Create non-existing file | copy, sync (as destination when file not exist)                                     |
| search   | Reading and listing file | ls, lsd, lsl, cat, md5sum, sha1sum and copy, sync (as source)                       |
| N/A      |                          | size, about                                                                         |

### Path Preservation

Policies, as described below, are of two basic types. `path preserving` and `non-path preserving`.

All policies which start with `ep` (**epff**, **eplfs**, **eplus**, **epmfs**, **eprand**) are `path preserving`. `ep` stands for `existing path`.

A path preserving policy will only consider upstreams where the relative path being accessed already exists.

When using non-path preserving policies paths will be created in target upstreams as necessary.

### Quota Relevant Policies

Some policies rely on quota information. These policies should be used only if your upstreams support the respective quota fields.

| Policy     | Required Field |
|------------|----------------|
| lfs, eplfs | Free           |
| mfs, epmfs | Free           |
| lus, eplus | Used           |
| lno, eplno | Objects        |

To check if your upstream supports the field, run `rclone about remote: [flags]` and see if the required field exists.

### Filters

Policies basically search upstream remotes and create a list of files / paths for functions to work on. The policy is responsible for filtering and sorting. The policy type defines the sorting but filtering is mostly uniform as described below.

* No **search** policies filter.
* All **action** policies will filter out remotes which are tagged as **read-only**.
* All **create** policies will filter out remotes which are tagged **read-only** or **no-create**.

If all remotes are filtered an error will be returned.

### Policy descriptions

The policies definition are inspired by [trapexit/mergerfs](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs) but not exactly the same. Some policy definition could be different due to the much larger latency of remote file systems.

| Policy           | Description                                                |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| all | Search category: same as **epall**. Action category: same as **epall**. Create category: act on all upstreams. |
| epall (existing path, all) | Search category: Given this order configured, act on the first one found where the relative path exists. Action category: apply to all found. Create category: act on all upstreams where the relative path exists. |
| epff (existing path, first found) | Act on the first one found, by the time upstreams reply, where the relative path exists. |
| eplfs (existing path, least free space) | Of all the upstreams on which the relative path exists choose the one with the least free space. |
| eplus (existing path, least used space) | Of all the upstreams on which the relative path exists choose the one with the least used space. |
| eplno (existing path, least number of objects) | Of all the upstreams on which the relative path exists choose the one with the least number of objects. |
| epmfs (existing path, most free space) | Of all the upstreams on which the relative path exists choose the one with the most free space. |
| eprand (existing path, random) | Calls **epall** and then randomizes. Returns only one upstream. |
| ff (first found) | Search category: same as **epff**. Action category: same as **epff**. Create category: Act on the first one found by the time upstreams reply. |
| lfs (least free space) | Search category: same as **eplfs**. Action category: same as **eplfs**. Create category: Pick the upstream with the least available free space. |
| lus (least used space) | Search category: same as **eplus**. Action category: same as **eplus**. Create category: Pick the upstream with the least used space. |
| lno (least number of objects) | Search category: same as **eplno**. Action category: same as **eplno**. Create category: Pick the upstream with the least number of objects. |
| mfs (most free space) | Search category: same as **epmfs**. Action category: same as **epmfs**. Create category: Pick the upstream with the most available free space. |
| newest | Pick the file / directory with the largest mtime. |
| rand (random) | Calls **all** and then randomizes. Returns only one upstream. |


### Writeback {#writeback}

The tag `:writeback` on an upstream remote can be used to make a simple cache
system like this:

```
[union]
type = union
action_policy = all
create_policy = all
search_policy = ff
upstreams = /local:writeback remote:dir
```

When files are opened for read, if the file is in `remote:dir` but not `/local`
then rclone will copy the file entirely into `/local` before returning a
reference to the file in `/local`. The copy will be done with the equivalent of
`rclone copy` so will use `--multi-thread-streams` if configured. Any copies
will be logged with an INFO log.

When files are written, they will be written to both `remote:dir` and `/local`.

As many remotes as desired can be added to `upstreams` but there should only be
one `:writeback` tag.

Rclone does not manage the `:writeback` remote in any way other than writing
files back to it. So if you need to expire old files or manage the size then you
will have to do this yourself.

#  WebDAV

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

To configure the WebDAV remote you will need to have a URL for it, and
a username and password.  If you know what kind of system you are
connecting to then rclone can enable extra features.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your WebDAV

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an WebDAV directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modification times and hashes

Plain WebDAV does not support modified times.  However when used with
Fastmail Files, Owncloud or Nextcloud rclone will support modified times.

Likewise plain WebDAV does not support hashes, however when used with
Fastmail Files, Owncloud or Nextcloud rclone will support SHA1 and MD5 hashes.
Depending on the exact version of Owncloud or Nextcloud hashes may
appear on all objects, or only on objects which had a hash uploaded
with them.

## Provider notes

See below for notes on specific providers.

### Fastmail Files

Use `https://webdav.fastmail.com/` or a subdirectory as the URL,
and your Fastmail email `username@domain.tld` as the username.
Follow [this documentation](https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/360058752854-App-passwords)
to create an app password with access to `Files (WebDAV)` and use
this as the password.

Fastmail supports modified times using the `X-OC-Mtime` header.

### Owncloud

Click on the settings cog in the bottom right of the page and this
will show the WebDAV URL that rclone needs in the config step.  It
will look something like `https://example.com/remote.php/webdav/`.

Owncloud supports modified times using the `X-OC-Mtime` header.

### Nextcloud

This is configured in an identical way to Owncloud.  Note that
Nextcloud initially did not support streaming of files (`rcat`) whereas
Owncloud did, but [this](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud-snap/issues/365) seems to be fixed as of 2020-11-27 (tested with rclone v1.53.1 and Nextcloud Server v19).

### Sharepoint Online

Rclone can be used with Sharepoint provided by OneDrive for Business
or Office365 Education Accounts.
This feature is only needed for a few of these Accounts,
mostly Office365 Education ones. These accounts are sometimes not
verified by the domain owner [github#1975](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1975)

This means that these accounts can't be added using the official
API (other Accounts should work with the "onedrive" option). However,
it is possible to access them using webdav.

To use a sharepoint remote with rclone, add it like this:
First, you need to get your remote's URL:

- Go [here](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/signin/)
  to open your OneDrive or to sign in
- Now take a look at your address bar, the URL should look like this:
  `https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx`

You'll only need this URL up to the email address. After that, you'll
most likely want to add "/Documents". That subdirectory contains
the actual data stored on your OneDrive.

Add the remote to rclone like this:
Configure the `url` as `https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/Documents`
and use your normal account email and password for `user` and `pass`.
If you have 2FA enabled, you have to generate an app password.
Set the `vendor` to `sharepoint`.

Your config file should look like this:

```
[sharepoint]
type = webdav
url = https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/Documents
vendor = sharepoint
user = YourEmailAddress
pass = encryptedpassword
```

### Sharepoint with NTLM Authentication

Use this option in case your (hosted) Sharepoint is not tied to OneDrive accounts and uses NTLM authentication.

To get the `url` configuration, similarly to the above, first navigate to the desired directory in your browser to get the URL,
then strip everything after the name of the opened directory.

Example:
If the URL is:
https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/12345/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx

The configuration to use would be:
https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/12345/Documents

Set the `vendor` to `sharepoint-ntlm`.

NTLM uses domain and user name combination for authentication,
set `user` to `DOMAIN\username`.

Your config file should look like this:

```
[sharepoint]
type = webdav
url = https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]/some-path-to/Documents
vendor = sharepoint-ntlm
user = DOMAIN\user
pass = encryptedpassword
```

#### Required Flags for SharePoint

As SharePoint does some special things with uploaded documents, you won't be able to use the documents size or the documents hash to compare if a file has been changed since the upload / which file is newer.

For Rclone calls copying files (especially Office files such as .docx, .xlsx, etc.) from/to SharePoint (like copy, sync, etc.), you should append these flags to ensure Rclone uses the "Last Modified" datetime property to compare your documents:

```
--ignore-size --ignore-checksum --update
```

## Rclone

Use this option if you are hosting remotes over WebDAV provided by rclone.
Read [rclone serve webdav](commands/rclone_serve_webdav/) for more details.

rclone serve supports modified times using the `X-OC-Mtime` header.


### dCache

dCache is a storage system that supports many protocols and
authentication/authorisation schemes.  For WebDAV clients, it allows
users to authenticate with username and password (BASIC), X.509,
Kerberos, and various bearer tokens, including
[Macaroons](https://www.dcache.org/manuals/workshop-2017-05-29-Umea/000-Final/anupam_macaroons_v02.pdf)
and [OpenID-Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect)
access tokens.

Configure as normal using the `other` type.  Don't enter a username or
password, instead enter your Macaroon as the `bearer_token`.

The config will end up looking something like this.

```
[dcache]
type = webdav
url = https://dcache...
vendor = other
user =
pass =
bearer_token = your-macaroon
```

There is a [script](https://github.com/sara-nl/GridScripts/blob/master/get-macaroon) that
obtains a Macaroon from a dCache WebDAV endpoint, and creates an rclone config file.

Macaroons may also be obtained from the dCacheView
web-browser/JavaScript client that comes with dCache.

### OpenID-Connect

dCache also supports authenticating with OpenID-Connect access tokens.
OpenID-Connect is a protocol (based on OAuth 2.0) that allows services
to identify users who have authenticated with some central service.

Support for OpenID-Connect in rclone is currently achieved using
another software package called
[oidc-agent](https://github.com/indigo-dc/oidc-agent).  This is a
command-line tool that facilitates obtaining an access token.  Once
installed and configured, an access token is obtained by running the
`oidc-token` command.  The following example shows a (shortened)
access token obtained from the *XDC* OIDC Provider.

```
paul@celebrimbor:~$ oidc-token XDC
eyJraWQ[...]QFXDt0
paul@celebrimbor:~$
```

**Note** Before the `oidc-token` command will work, the refresh token
must be loaded into the oidc agent.  This is done with the `oidc-add`
command (e.g., `oidc-add XDC`).  This is typically done once per login
session.  Full details on this and how to register oidc-agent with
your OIDC Provider are provided in the [oidc-agent
documentation](https://indigo-dc.gitbooks.io/oidc-agent/).

The rclone `bearer_token_command` configuration option is used to
fetch the access token from oidc-agent.

Configure as a normal WebDAV endpoint, using the 'other' vendor,
leaving the username and password empty.  When prompted, choose to
edit the advanced config and enter the command to get a bearer token
(e.g., `oidc-agent XDC`).

The following example config shows a WebDAV endpoint that uses
oidc-agent to supply an access token from the *XDC* OIDC Provider.

```
[dcache]
type = webdav
url = https://dcache.example.org/
vendor = other
bearer_token_command = oidc-token XDC
```

#  Yandex Disk

[Yandex Disk](https://disk.yandex.com) is a cloud storage solution created by [Yandex](https://yandex.com).

## Configuration

Here is an example of making a yandex configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```

y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: yandex
- client_id:
- client_secret:
- token: {"access_token":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","token_type":"OAuth","expiry":"2016-12-29T12:27:11.362788025Z"}
Keep this "remote" remote?
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Yandex Disk. This only runs from the moment it
opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.
This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require you to
unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

See top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote path, deleting any
excess files in the path.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:directory

Yandex paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

### Modification times and hashes

Modified times are supported and are stored accurate to 1 ns in custom
metadata called `rclone_modified` in RFC3339 with nanoseconds format.

The MD5 hash algorithm is natively supported by Yandex Disk.

### Emptying Trash

If you wish to empty your trash you can use the `rclone cleanup remote:`
command which will permanently delete all your trashed files. This command
does not take any path arguments.

### Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the `rclone about remote:`
command which will display your usage limit (quota) and the current usage.

### Restricted filename characters

The [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
are replaced.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

## Limitations

When uploading very large files (bigger than about 5 GiB) you will need
to increase the `--timeout` parameter.  This is because Yandex pauses
(perhaps to calculate the MD5SUM for the entire file) before returning
confirmation that the file has been uploaded.  The default handling of
timeouts in rclone is to assume a 5 minute pause is an error and close
the connection - you'll see `net/http: timeout awaiting response
headers` errors in the logs if this is happening.  Setting the timeout
to twice the max size of file in GiB should be enough, so if you want
to upload a 30 GiB file set a timeout of `2 * 30 = 60m`, that is
`--timeout 60m`.

Having a Yandex Mail account is mandatory to use the Yandex.Disk subscription.
Token generation will work without a mail account, but Rclone won't be able to complete any actions.

```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Rclone runs a webserver on your local computer to collect the
authorization token from Zoho Workdrive. This is only from the moment
your browser is opened until the token is returned.
The webserver runs on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/`.
If local port `53682` is protected by a firewall you may need to temporarily
unblock the firewall to complete authorization.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

See top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote path, deleting any
excess files in the path.

    rclone sync --interactive /home/local/directory remote:directory

Zoho paths may be as deep as required, eg `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

### Modification times and hashes

Modified times are currently not supported for Zoho Workdrive

No hash algorithms are supported.

### Usage information

To view your current quota you can use the `rclone about remote:`
command which will display your current usage.

### Restricted filename characters

Only control characters and invalid UTF-8 are replaced. In addition most
Unicode full-width characters are not supported at all and will be removed 
from filenames during upload.

## Setting up your own client_id

For Zoho we advise you to set up your own client_id. To do so you have to complete the following steps.

1. Log in to the [Zoho API Console](https://api-console.zoho.com)

2. Create a new client of type "Server-based Application". The name and website don't matter, but you must add the redirect URL `http://localhost:53682/`.

3. Once the client is created, you can go to the settings tab and enable it in other regions.

The client id and client secret can now be used with rclone.

#  Local Filesystem

Local paths are specified as normal filesystem paths, e.g. `/path/to/wherever`, so

    rclone sync --interactive /home/source /tmp/destination

Will sync `/home/source` to `/tmp/destination`.

## Configuration

For consistencies sake one can also configure a remote of type
`local` in the config file, and access the local filesystem using
rclone remote paths, e.g. `remote:path/to/wherever`, but it is probably
easier not to.

### Modification times

Rclone reads and writes the modification times using an accuracy determined
by the OS. Typically this is 1ns on Linux, 10 ns on Windows and 1 Second
on OS X.

### Filenames ###

Filenames should be encoded in UTF-8 on disk. This is the normal case
for Windows and OS X.

There is a bit more uncertainty in the Linux world, but new
distributions will have UTF-8 encoded files names. If you are using an
old Linux filesystem with non UTF-8 file names (e.g. latin1) then you
can use the `convmv` tool to convert the filesystem to UTF-8. This
tool is available in most distributions' package managers.

If an invalid (non-UTF8) filename is read, the invalid characters will
be replaced with a quoted representation of the invalid bytes. The name
`gro\xdf` will be transferred as `gro‛DF`. `rclone` will emit a debug
message in this case (use `-v` to see), e.g.

```
Local file system at .: Replacing invalid UTF-8 characters in "gro\xdf"
```

#### Restricted characters

With the local backend, restrictions on the characters that are usable in
file or directory names depend on the operating system. To check what
rclone will replace by default on your system, run `rclone help flags local-encoding`.

On non Windows platforms the following characters are replaced when
handling file names.

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／           |

When running on Windows the following characters are replaced. This
list is based on the [Windows file naming conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/desktop/FileIO/naming-a-file#naming-conventions).

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |

| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜           |

File names on Windows can also not end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |
| .         | 0x2E  | ．           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be converted to UTF-16.

### Paths on Windows ###

On Windows there are many ways of specifying a path to a file system resource.
Local paths can be absolute, like `C:\path\to\wherever`, or relative,
like `..\wherever`. Network paths in UNC format, `\\server\share`, are also supported.
Path separator can be either `\` (as in `C:\path\to\wherever`) or `/` (as in `C:/path/to/wherever`).
Length of these paths are limited to 259 characters for files and 247
characters for directories, but there is an alternative extended-length
path format increasing the limit to (approximately) 32,767 characters.
This format requires absolute paths and the use of prefix `\\?\`,
e.g. `\\?\D:\some\very\long\path`. For convenience rclone will automatically
convert regular paths into the corresponding extended-length paths,
so in most cases you do not have to worry about this (read more [below](#long-paths)).
Using the same prefix `\\?\` it is also possible to specify path to volumes
identified by their GUID, e.g. `\\?\Volume{b75e2c83-0000-0000-0000-602f00000000}\some\path`.

#### Long paths ####

Rclone handles long paths automatically, by converting all paths to
[extended-length path format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation), which allows paths up to 32,767 characters.

This conversion will ensure paths are absolute and prefix them with
the `\\?\`. This is why you will see that your paths, for instance
`.\files` is shown as path `\\?\C:\files` in the output, and `\\server\share`
as `\\?\UNC\server\share`.

However, in rare cases this may cause problems with buggy file
system drivers like [EncFS](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/261).
To disable UNC conversion globally, add this to your `.rclone.conf` file:

```
[local]
nounc = true
```

If you want to selectively disable UNC, you can add it to a separate entry like this:

```
[nounc]
type = local
nounc = true
```
And use rclone like this:

`rclone copy c:\src nounc:z:\dst`

This will use UNC paths on `c:\src` but not on `z:\dst`.
Of course this will cause problems if the absolute path length of a
file exceeds 259 characters on z, so only use this option if you have to.

### Symlinks / Junction points

Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).

If you supply `--copy-links` or `-L` then rclone will follow the
symlink and copy the pointed to file or directory.  Note that this
flag is incompatible with `--links` / `-l`.

This flag applies to all commands.

For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this

```
$ tree /tmp/a
/tmp/a
├── b -> ../b
├── expected -> ../expected
├── one
└── two
    └── three
```

Then you can see the difference with and without the flag like this

```
$ rclone ls /tmp/a
        6 one
        6 two/three
```

and

```
$ rclone -L ls /tmp/a
     4174 expected
        6 one
        6 two/three
        6 b/two
        6 b/one
```

#### --links, -l 

Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).

If you supply this flag then rclone will copy symbolic links from the local storage,
and store them as text files, with a '.rclonelink' suffix in the remote storage.

The text file will contain the target of the symbolic link (see example).

This flag applies to all commands.

For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this

```
$ tree /tmp/a
/tmp/a
├── file1 -> ./file4
└── file2 -> /home/user/file3
```

Copying the entire directory with '-l'

```
$ rclone copy -l /tmp/a/ remote:/tmp/a/
```

The remote files are created with a '.rclonelink' suffix

```
$ rclone ls remote:/tmp/a
       5 file1.rclonelink
      14 file2.rclonelink
```

The remote files will contain the target of the symbolic links

```
$ rclone cat remote:/tmp/a/file1.rclonelink
./file4

$ rclone cat remote:/tmp/a/file2.rclonelink
/home/user/file3
```

Copying them back with '-l'

```
$ rclone copy -l remote:/tmp/a/ /tmp/b/

$ tree /tmp/b
/tmp/b
├── file1 -> ./file4
└── file2 -> /home/user/file3
```

However, if copied back without '-l'

```
$ rclone copyto remote:/tmp/a/ /tmp/b/

$ tree /tmp/b
/tmp/b
├── file1.rclonelink
└── file2.rclonelink
````

If you want to copy a single file with `-l` then you must use the `.rclonelink` suffix.

```
$ rclone copy -l remote:/tmp/a/file1.rclonelink /tmp/c

$ tree /tmp/c
/tmp/c
└── file1 -> ./file4
```

Note that this flag is incompatible with `-copy-links` / `-L`.

### Restricting filesystems with --one-file-system

Normally rclone will recurse through filesystems as mounted.

However if you set `--one-file-system` or `-x` this tells rclone to
stay in the filesystem specified by the root and not to recurse into
different file systems.

For example if you have a directory hierarchy like this

```
root
├── disk1     - disk1 mounted on the root
│   └── file3 - stored on disk1
├── disk2     - disk2 mounted on the root
│   └── file4 - stored on disk12
├── file1     - stored on the root disk
└── file2     - stored on the root disk
```

Using `rclone --one-file-system copy root remote:` will only copy `file1` and `file2`.  Eg

```
$ rclone -q --one-file-system ls root
        0 file1
        0 file2
```

```
$ rclone -q ls root
        0 disk1/file3
        0 disk2/file4
        0 file1
        0 file2
```

**NB** Rclone (like most unix tools such as `du`, `rsync` and `tar`)
treats a bind mount to the same device as being on the same
filesystem.

**NB** This flag is only available on Unix based systems.  On systems
where it isn't supported (e.g. Windows) it will be ignored.


### Advanced options

Here are the Advanced options specific to local (Local Disk).

#### --local-nounc

Disable UNC (long path names) conversion on Windows.

Properties:

- Config:      nounc
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_NOUNC
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false
- Examples:
    - "true"
        - Disables long file names.

#### --copy-links / -L

Follow symlinks and copy the pointed to item.

Properties:

- Config:      copy_links
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_COPY_LINKS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --links / -l

Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a '.rclonelink' extension.

Properties:

- Config:      links
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_LINKS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --skip-links

Don't warn about skipped symlinks.

This flag disables warning messages on skipped symlinks or junction
points, as you explicitly acknowledge that they should be skipped.

Properties:

- Config:      skip_links
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-zero-size-links

Assume the Stat size of links is zero (and read them instead) (deprecated).

Rclone used to use the Stat size of links as the link size, but this fails in quite a few places:

- Windows
- On some virtual filesystems (such ash LucidLink)
- Android

So rclone now always reads the link.


Properties:

- Config:      zero_size_links
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_ZERO_SIZE_LINKS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-unicode-normalization

Apply unicode NFC normalization to paths and filenames.

This flag can be used to normalize file names into unicode NFC form
that are read from the local filesystem.

Rclone does not normally touch the encoding of file names it reads from
the file system.

This can be useful when using macOS as it normally provides decomposed (NFD)
unicode which in some language (eg Korean) doesn't display properly on
some OSes.

Note that rclone compares filenames with unicode normalization in the sync
routine so this flag shouldn't normally be used.

Properties:

- Config:      unicode_normalization
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_UNICODE_NORMALIZATION
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-no-check-updated

Don't check to see if the files change during upload.

Normally rclone checks the size and modification time of files as they
are being uploaded and aborts with a message which starts "can't copy -
source file is being updated" if the file changes during upload.

However on some file systems this modification time check may fail (e.g.
[Glusterfs #2206](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2206)) so this
check can be disabled with this flag.

If this flag is set, rclone will use its best efforts to transfer a
file which is being updated. If the file is only having things
appended to it (e.g. a log) then rclone will transfer the log file with
the size it had the first time rclone saw it.

If the file is being modified throughout (not just appended to) then
the transfer may fail with a hash check failure.

In detail, once the file has had stat() called on it for the first
time we:

- Only transfer the size that stat gave
- Only checksum the size that stat gave
- Don't update the stat info for the file

**NB** do not use this flag on a Windows Volume Shadow (VSS). For some
unknown reason, files in a VSS sometimes show different sizes from the
directory listing (where the initial stat value comes from on Windows)
and when stat is called on them directly. Other copy tools always use
the direct stat value and setting this flag will disable that.


Properties:

- Config:      no_check_updated
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_CHECK_UPDATED
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --one-file-system / -x

Don't cross filesystem boundaries (unix/macOS only).

Properties:

- Config:      one_file_system
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_ONE_FILE_SYSTEM
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-case-sensitive

Force the filesystem to report itself as case sensitive.

Normally the local backend declares itself as case insensitive on
Windows/macOS and case sensitive for everything else.  Use this flag
to override the default choice.

Properties:

- Config:      case_sensitive
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_CASE_SENSITIVE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-case-insensitive

Force the filesystem to report itself as case insensitive.

Normally the local backend declares itself as case insensitive on
Windows/macOS and case sensitive for everything else.  Use this flag
to override the default choice.

Properties:

- Config:      case_insensitive
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_CASE_INSENSITIVE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-no-clone

Disable reflink cloning for server-side copies.

Normally, for local-to-local transfers, rclone will "clone" the file when
possible, and fall back to "copying" only when cloning is not supported.

Cloning creates a shallow copy (or "reflink") which initially shares blocks with
the original file. Unlike a "hardlink", the two files are independent and
neither will affect the other if subsequently modified.

Cloning is usually preferable to copying, as it is much faster and is
deduplicated by default (i.e. having two identical files does not consume more
storage than having just one.)  However, for use cases where data redundancy is
preferable, --local-no-clone can be used to disable cloning and force "deep" copies.

Currently, cloning is only supported when using APFS on macOS (support for other
platforms may be added in the future.)

Properties:

- Config:      no_clone
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_CLONE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-no-preallocate

Disable preallocation of disk space for transferred files.

Preallocation of disk space helps prevent filesystem fragmentation.
However, some virtual filesystem layers (such as Google Drive File
Stream) may incorrectly set the actual file size equal to the
preallocated space, causing checksum and file size checks to fail.
Use this flag to disable preallocation.

Properties:

- Config:      no_preallocate
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_PREALLOCATE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-no-sparse

Disable sparse files for multi-thread downloads.

On Windows platforms rclone will make sparse files when doing
multi-thread downloads. This avoids long pauses on large files where
the OS zeros the file. However sparse files may be undesirable as they
cause disk fragmentation and can be slow to work with.

Properties:

- Config:      no_sparse
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_SPARSE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-no-set-modtime

Disable setting modtime.

Normally rclone updates modification time of files after they are done
uploading. This can cause permissions issues on Linux platforms when 
the user rclone is running as does not own the file uploaded, such as
when copying to a CIFS mount owned by another user. If this option is 
enabled, rclone will no longer update the modtime after copying a file.

Properties:

- Config:      no_set_modtime
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_SET_MODTIME
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-time-type

Set what kind of time is returned.

Normally rclone does all operations on the mtime or Modification time.

If you set this flag then rclone will return the Modified time as whatever
you set here. So if you use "rclone lsl --local-time-type ctime" then
you will see ctimes in the listing.

If the OS doesn't support returning the time_type specified then rclone
will silently replace it with the modification time which all OSes support.

- mtime is supported by all OSes
- atime is supported on all OSes except: plan9, js
- btime is only supported on: Windows, macOS, freebsd, netbsd
- ctime is supported on all Oses except: Windows, plan9, js

Note that setting the time will still set the modified time so this is
only useful for reading.


Properties:

- Config:      time_type
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_TIME_TYPE
- Type:        mtime|atime|btime|ctime
- Default:     mtime
- Examples:
    - "mtime"
        - The last modification time.
    - "atime"
        - The last access time.
    - "btime"
        - The creation time.
    - "ctime"
        - The last status change time.

#### --local-encoding

The encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

Properties:

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_ENCODING
- Type:        Encoding
- Default:     Slash,Dot

#### --local-description

Description of the remote.

Properties:

- Config:      description
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_DESCRIPTION
- Type:        string
- Required:    false

### Metadata

Depending on which OS is in use the local backend may return only some
of the system metadata. Setting system metadata is supported on all
OSes but setting user metadata is only supported on linux, freebsd,
netbsd, macOS and Solaris. It is **not** supported on Windows yet
([see pkg/attrs#47](https://github.com/pkg/xattr/issues/47)).

User metadata is stored as extended attributes (which may not be
supported by all file systems) under the "user.*" prefix.

Metadata is supported on files and directories.

Here are the possible system metadata items for the local backend.

| Name | Help | Type | Example | Read Only |
|------|------|------|---------|-----------|
| atime | Time of last access | RFC 3339 | 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00 | N |
| btime | Time of file birth (creation) | RFC 3339 | 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00 | N |
| gid | Group ID of owner | decimal number | 500 | N |
| mode | File type and mode | octal, unix style | 0100664 | N |
| mtime | Time of last modification | RFC 3339 | 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00 | N |
| rdev | Device ID (if special file) | hexadecimal | 1abc | N |
| uid | User ID of owner | decimal number | 500 | N |

See the [metadata](https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata) docs for more info.

## Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the local backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See the [backend](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command).

### noop

A null operation for testing backend commands

    rclone backend noop remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This is a test command which has some options
you can try to change the output.

Options:

- "echo": echo the input arguments
- "error": return an error based on option value

* Major changes
    * Files will be copied to a temporary name ending in `.partial` when copying to `local`,`ftp`,`sftp` then renamed at the end of the transfer. (Janne Hellsten, Nick Craig-Wood)
        * This helps with data integrity as we don't delete the existing file until the new one is complete.
        * It can be disabled with the [--inplace](https://rclone.org/docs/#inplace) flag.
        * This behaviour will also happen if the backend is wrapped, for example `sftp` wrapped with `crypt`.

# Bugs and Limitations

## Limitations

### Directory timestamps aren't preserved on some backends

As of `v1.66`, rclone supports syncing directory modtimes, if the backend
supports it. Some backends do not support it -- see
[overview](https://rclone.org/overview/) for a complete list. Additionally, note
that empty directories are not synced by default (this can be enabled with
`--create-empty-src-dirs`.)

### Rclone struggles with millions of files in a directory/bucket

Currently rclone loads each directory/bucket entirely into memory before
using it.  Since each rclone object takes 0.5k-1k of memory this can take
a very long time and use a large amount of memory.

Millions of files in a directory tends to occur on bucket-based remotes
(e.g. S3 buckets) since those remotes do not segregate subdirectories within
the bucket.

### Bucket-based remotes and folders

Bucket-based remotes (e.g. S3/GCS/Swift/B2) do not have a concept of
directories.  Rclone therefore cannot create directories in them which
means that empty directories on a bucket-based remote will tend to
disappear.

Some software creates empty keys ending in `/` as directory markers.
Rclone doesn't do this as it potentially creates more objects and
costs more.  This ability may be added in the future (probably via a
flag/option).

# Frequently Asked Questions

### Do all cloud storage systems support all rclone commands ###

Yes they do.  All the rclone commands (e.g. `sync`, `copy`, etc.) will
work on all the remote storage systems.

### Can I copy the config from one machine to another ###

Sure!  Rclone stores all of its config in a single file.  If you want
to find this file, run `rclone config file` which will tell you where
it is.

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for more info.

### How do I configure rclone on a remote / headless box with no browser? ###

This has now been documented in its own [remote setup page](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/).

### Can rclone sync directly from drive to s3 ###

Rclone can sync between two remote cloud storage systems just fine.

Note that it effectively downloads the file and uploads it again, so
the node running rclone would need to have lots of bandwidth.

The syncs would be incremental (on a file by file basis).

e.g.

    rclone sync --interactive drive:Folder s3:bucket


### Using rclone from multiple locations at the same time ###

You can use rclone from multiple places at the same time if you choose
different subdirectory for the output, e.g.

```
Server A> rclone sync --interactive /tmp/whatever remote:ServerA
Server B> rclone sync --interactive /tmp/whatever remote:ServerB
```

If you sync to the same directory then you should use rclone copy
otherwise the two instances of rclone may delete each other's files, e.g.

```
Server A> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup
Server B> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup
```

The file names you upload from Server A and Server B should be
different in this case, otherwise some file systems (e.g. Drive) may
make duplicates.

### Why doesn't rclone support partial transfers / binary diffs like rsync? ###

Rclone stores each file you transfer as a native object on the remote
cloud storage system.  This means that you can see the files you
upload as expected using alternative access methods (e.g. using the
Google Drive web interface).  There is a 1:1 mapping between files on
your hard disk and objects created in the cloud storage system.

Cloud storage systems (at least none I've come across yet) don't
support partially uploading an object. You can't take an existing
object, and change some bytes in the middle of it.

It would be possible to make a sync system which stored binary diffs
like rsync does, instead of whole objects, but that would break the
1:1 mapping of files on your hard disk to objects in the remote cloud
storage system.

All the cloud storage systems support partial downloads of content, so
it would be possible to make partial downloads work.  However to make
this work efficiently this would require storing a significant amount
of metadata, which breaks the desired 1:1 mapping of files to objects.

### Can rclone do bi-directional sync? ###

Yes, since rclone v1.58.0, [bidirectional cloud sync](https://rclone.org/bisync/) is
available.

### Can I use rclone with an HTTP proxy? ###

Yes. rclone will follow the standard environment variables for
proxies, similar to cURL and other programs.

In general the variables are called `http_proxy` (for services reached
over `http`) and `https_proxy` (for services reached over `https`).  Most
public services will be using `https`, but you may wish to set both.

The content of the variable is `protocol://server:port`.  The protocol
value is the one used to talk to the proxy server, itself, and is commonly
either `http` or `socks5`.

Slightly annoyingly, there is no _standard_ for the name; some applications
may use `http_proxy` but another one `HTTP_PROXY`.  The `Go` libraries
used by `rclone` will try both variations, but you may wish to set all
possibilities.  So, on Linux, you may end up with code similar to

    export http_proxy=http://proxyserver:12345
    export https_proxy=$http_proxy
    export HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy
    export HTTPS_PROXY=$http_proxy


Note: If the proxy server requires a username and password, then use

    export http_proxy=http://username:password@proxyserver:12345
    export https_proxy=$http_proxy
    export HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy
    export HTTPS_PROXY=$http_proxy

The `NO_PROXY` allows you to disable the proxy for specific hosts.
Hosts must be comma separated, and can contain domains or parts.
For instance "foo.com" also matches "bar.foo.com".

e.g.

    export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.0/8,my.host.name
    export NO_PROXY=$no_proxy

Note that the FTP backend does not support `ftp_proxy` yet.

### Rclone gives x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided error ###

This means that `rclone` can't find the SSL root certificates.  Likely
you are running `rclone` on a NAS with a cut-down Linux OS, or
possibly on Solaris.

Rclone (via the Go runtime) tries to load the root certificates from
these places on Linux.

    "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt", // Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo etc.
    "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt",   // Fedora/RHEL
    "/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem",             // OpenSUSE
    "/etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem",            // OpenELEC

So doing something like this should fix the problem.  It also sets the
time which is important for SSL to work properly.

```
mkdir -p /etc/ssl/certs/
curl -o /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt
ntpclient -s -h pool.ntp.org
```

The two environment variables `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR`, mentioned in the [x509 package](https://godoc.org/crypto/x509),
provide an additional way to provide the SSL root certificates.

Note that you may need to add the `--insecure` option to the `curl` command line if it doesn't work without.

```
curl --insecure -o /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt
```

### Rclone gives Failed to load config file: function not implemented error ###

Likely this means that you are running rclone on Linux version not
supported by the go runtime, ie earlier than version 2.6.23.

See the [system requirements section in the go install
docs](https://golang.org/doc/install) for full details.

### All my uploaded docx/xlsx/pptx files appear as archive/zip ###

This is caused by uploading these files from a Windows computer which
hasn't got the Microsoft Office suite installed.  The easiest way to
fix is to install the Word viewer and the Microsoft Office
Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 and later
versions' file formats

### tcp lookup some.domain.com no such host ###

This happens when rclone cannot resolve a domain. Please check that
your DNS setup is generally working, e.g.

```
# both should print a long list of possible IP addresses
dig www.googleapis.com          # resolve using your default DNS
dig www.googleapis.com @8.8.8.8 # resolve with Google's DNS server
```

If you are using `systemd-resolved` (default on Arch Linux), ensure it
is at version 233 or higher. Previous releases contain a bug which
causes not all domains to be resolved properly.


The Go resolver decision can be influenced with the `GODEBUG=netdns=...`
environment variable. This also allows to resolve certain issues with
DNS resolution. On Windows or MacOS systems, try forcing use of the
internal Go resolver by setting `GODEBUG=netdns=go` at runtime. On
other systems (Linux, \*BSD, etc) try forcing use of the system
name resolver by setting `GODEBUG=netdns=cgo` (and recompile rclone
from source with CGO enabled if necessary). See the
[name resolution section in the go docs](https://golang.org/pkg/net/#hdr-Name_Resolution).

### Failed to start auth webserver on Windows ###
```
Error: config failed to refresh token: failed to start auth webserver: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:53682: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions.
...
yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss Fatal error: config failed to refresh token: failed to start auth webserver: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:53682: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions.
```

This is sometimes caused by the Host Network Service causing issues with opening the port on the host.

A simple solution may be restarting the Host Network Service with eg. Powershell
```
Restart-Service hns
```

### The total size reported in the stats for a sync is wrong and keeps changing

It is likely you have more than 10,000 files that need to be
synced. By default, rclone only gets 10,000 files ahead in a sync so as
not to use up too much memory. You can change this default with the
[--max-backlog](https://rclone.org/docs/#max-backlog-n) flag.

### Rclone is using too much memory or appears to have a memory leak

Rclone is written in Go which uses a garbage collector.  The default
settings for the garbage collector mean that it runs when the heap
size has doubled.

However it is possible to tune the garbage collector to use less
memory by [setting GOGC](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/gogc) to a lower
value, say `export GOGC=20`.  This will make the garbage collector
work harder, reducing memory size at the expense of CPU usage.

The most common cause of rclone using lots of memory is a single
directory with millions of files in. Rclone has to load this entirely
into memory as rclone objects. Each rclone object takes 0.5k-1k of
memory. There is
[a workaround for this](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/wiki/Big-syncs-with-millions-of-files)
which involves a bit of scripting.

### Rclone changes fullwidth Unicode punctuation marks in file names

For example: On a Windows system, you have a file with name `Test：1.jpg`,
where `：` is the Unicode fullwidth colon symbol. When using rclone
to copy this to your Google Drive, you will notice that the file
gets renamed to `Test:1.jpg`, where `:` is the regular (halfwidth) colon.

The reason for such renames is the way rclone handles different
[restricted filenames](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-filenames) on different
cloud storage systems. It tries to avoid ambiguous file names as
much and allow moving files between many cloud storage systems
transparently, by replacing invalid characters with similar looking
Unicode characters when transferring to one storage system, and replacing
back again when transferring to a different storage system where the
original characters are supported. When the same Unicode characters
are intentionally used in file names, this replacement strategy leads
to unwanted renames. Read more [here](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-filenames-caveats).
