// OpenFile is the generalized open call; most users will use Open or Create
// instead. It opens the named file with specified flag (O_RDONLY etc.) and
// perm (before umask), if applicable. If successful, methods on the returned
// File can be used for I/O. If there is an error, it will be of type
// *PathError.
//
// Under both Unix and Windows this will allow open files to be
// renamed and or deleted.
