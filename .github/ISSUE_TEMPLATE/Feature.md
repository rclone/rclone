Welcome :-)

So you've got an idea to improve rclone? We love that!
You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.

Probably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.
The update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/

If it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:

  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.
  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/
  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).
  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)

Looking forward to your great idea!

The Rclone Developers
