# Ports for tests

All these tests need to run on a different port.

They should be bound to localhost so they are not accessible externally.

## Non localhost tests

All these use `$(docker_ip)` which means they don't work on macOS or
Windows. It is proabably possible to make them work with some effort
but will require port forwarding a range of ports and configuring the
FTP server to only use that range of ports. The FTP server will likely
need know it is behind a NAT so it advertises the correct external IP.
