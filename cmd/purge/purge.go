	Use:   "purge remote:path",
	Short: `Remove the path and all of its contents.`,
	Long: `Remove the path and all of its contents.  Note that this does not obey
include/exclude filters - everything will be removed.  Use the
[delete](/commands/rclone_delete/) command if you want to selectively
delete files. To delete empty directories only, use command
[rmdir](/commands/rclone_rmdir/) or [rmdirs](/commands/rclone_rmdirs/).

The concurrency of this operation is controlled by the ` + "`--checkers`" + ` global flag. However, some backends will
implement this command directly, in which case ` + "`--checkers`" + ` will be ignored.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
` + "`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i`" + ` flag.
