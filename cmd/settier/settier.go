	Use:   "settier tier remote:path",
	Short: `Changes storage class/tier of objects in remote.`,
	Long: `Changes storage tier or class at remote if supported. Few cloud storage
services provides different storage classes on objects, for example
AWS S3 and Glacier, Azure Blob storage - Hot, Cool and Archive,
Google Cloud Storage, Regional Storage, Nearline, Coldline etc.

Note that, certain tier changes make objects not available to access immediately.
For example tiering to archive in azure blob storage makes objects in frozen state,
user can restore by setting tier to Hot/Cool, similarly S3 to Glacier makes object
inaccessible.true

You can use it to tier single object

` + "```sh" + `
rclone settier Cool remote:path/file
` + "```" + `

Or use rclone filters to set tier on only specific files

` + "```sh" + `
rclone --include "*.txt" settier Hot remote:path/dir
` + "```" + `

Or just provide remote directory and all files in directory will be tiered

` + "```sh" + `
rclone settier tier remote:path/dir
` + "```",
